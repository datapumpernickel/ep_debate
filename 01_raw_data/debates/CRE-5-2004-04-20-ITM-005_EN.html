<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2001, in the Mont Blanc tunnel, in the Tauern tunnel and in the Gotthard tunnel, we had three major fire disasters. Those events made it abundantly clear to us at the time that, on the main stretches of the trans-European network and in particular in its tunnels, we had something of a safety deficit. On that occasion, Parliament wasted no time in asking the Commission to carry out the appropriate investigations of this and then to submit a text that would, by becoming European law, enable us to ensure that we could achieve greater safety for the users of the roads of Europe – especially in tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken up the subject in a way which deserves our gratitude, and in the last two and a half years it has in particular been able, in a consistently difficult process of dialogue with Parliament on the one hand and the Council on the other, to make its contribution to ensuring that in record time we have produced a very good joint text, which we can now agree at second reading and thus even before the end of the present parliamentary term. We can then expect, as soon as possible, on the roads of Europe and in the tunnels of Europe, a higher, better degree of safety than prevailed in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the many points that it has been possible to include in this directive or statutory text, I would like to mention one subject in particular, which above all Parliament, but not Parliament alone, regarded as of particular interest, namely the fact that we are also considering, quite specifically, the interests of the disabled. Last year, we had the European Year of People with Disabilities. At the time, we rightly stressed that it was not sufficient to have a year in which we frequently used the word ‘disabled’ and then did nothing about it. We also had quite specifically to seek to take the subject of tunnel safety seriously in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also particularly delighted, as rapporteur for this proposal, by the fact that we have also been able to include in the meetings and negotiations for this admittedly far from simple text two countries that are not original Member States of the European Union – I mean unfortunately not original Member States of the European Union – but who are of course also of very particular importance for questions of safety on the European road network. One is Switzerland, and the other is Norway. Both these countries, especially at the level of the Council, but also in meetings with Parliament’s rapporteur, have been involved to a large extent in the discussions, and we can expect that as a result in these countries also a uniform tunnel safety standard at the general European level can be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly – and this is the last point that I would like to stress – we can assume that, in the future Member States of the European Union, which will be full members of the EU as from 1 May 2004, with this statutory text, which is for some of the new members part of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>that they have yet to take on board, we have created a European basis for ensuring that these parts of the overall European road network are also rapidly offered the degree of safety which must be guaranteed by road builders, road maintainers and road monitors, as we rightly believe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank warmly all those who have actively collaborated in the creation of this piece of legislation, especially the Commissioner, who has been decisively committed to the subject, but above all also the Commission as a whole with its staff and both the Council and its staff and also Parliament and our groups here in this House and their staff. They all worked on this text and contributed to the result, which is that, in all probability in a few minutes’ time, we will be able to give almost unanimous assent to this text, and I believe – and we will also rightly be saying this in the next few weeks to the population of Europe – that the work has been worthwhile in the interests of safety for the users of Europe’s roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I have listened carefully to Mr Rack’s presentation of his splendid report. I should like to say that we are working to improve safety on European roads. Mr Rack himself pointed this out in the course of his presentation at second reading. In particular, we are focusing on an aspect that came to the forefront following the terrible accidents in the Alps in 1999 and 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that yet another fatal accident took place last week. It happened in the Baregg tunnel in Switzerland. Once again, attention has focused on fires in tunnels. They are perceived as one of the most dangerous incidents possible, and must be dealt with. In 2002 the Commission forwarded a proposal for a directive laying down a series of minimum safety requirements for tunnels. This proposal aimed to prevent accidents of type mentioned, or at least to minimise their consequences. Parliament had previously adopted a number of resolutions on the subject, and it also supported this draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should mention that the Council responded very positively. In addition, I have to say that these proposals are in line with the initiatives regarding the transport sector put forward for the European regional area within the framework of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been very supportive throughout. The same is true of the Council. I should emphasise that it is thanks to support from both quarters that full agreement has at last been reached by all three institutions, after discussions lasting 15 months. Consequently, this text will soon see the light of day. Parliament is to vote on it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has undertaken a thorough study of the Commission’s proposal. It tabled 78 very detailed amendments at first reading. This demonstrates Parliament’s noteworthy dedication and depth of knowledge. Most of the amendments have been incorporated into the revised proposal presented by the Commission. The Council did likewise in its common position on 26 February last.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Rack and to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for studying this very technical text in such depth. They are to be commended also for their efficiency throughout and for maintaining such a constructive approach. The engineers responsible for safety in tunnels in the Member States have a great deal of work to do to implement the agreement in all tunnels across the Union. Of course, the Member States also need to make an effort to improve safety in tunnels, which are such vulnerable points of the road network.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Mr Rack once again. I would also like to thank Mr Markov. I have not yet replied to him, but I would like to congratulate him on the work done regarding driving time, safety and controls. Good controls are essential. Otherwise, the limits will not be observed. Any number of statements can be made, but they will never be implemented unless the controls are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member will be aware of the effort we made regarding digital tachometers. We shall be writing to him in the near future to inform him of the decisions taken. As a result of these decisions some countries will begin to fit this type of tachometers in July of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cocilovo is also to be congratulated on his achievements, as I mentioned just now. In general, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to thank all members of the Committee on Transport. I am most grateful for the outstanding cooperation we have developed over these years. It has made it possible to adopt a series of key measures designed to move the European Union’s transport sector forward. Allow me to mention a few of these achievements. They concern safer and more competitive transport, taking account of the environment promoting sustainable development and making the internal market a reality. Transport is playing its part to promote growth and the well being of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall briefly the adoption of the first rail package. A debate on the second package is due to take place tomorrow. The second package will allow a truly European railway to be developed at last. I could remind the House also of the adoption and implementation of the single European sky. This will allow management of European air space to be modernised. As is the case in the railway sector, European air space will be integrated. Both air and rail spaces will become genuinely European. Measures on maritime safety have been adopted too. Some were debated this very morning. In addition, the Galileo project was conceived, undertaken and finally launched. As a result, Europe is now at the cutting edge of technology and able to compete at all levels with other leaders in this most technologically advanced area of the space sector. Further, the Trans-European networks have been reviewed. This involved an inordinate amount of joint work. I trust final adoption will take place the day after tomorrow. I have referred to some of the flagship ventures. Nonetheless, others are also worthy of mention, such as support for passengers’ rights. In the air, maritime, and rail transport sectors measures have been developed to improve both safety and security. Operational agencies have been created to protect all forms of transport. Social legislation has been taken forward. I could also refer to the adoption of a wide range of other proposals, not to mention international agreements concerning the maritime and air sectors for example. An effort has been made to foster cooperation with all our neighbours both in the Mediterranean area and throughout Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, despite the movement and noise around the House, I would not like to miss this opportunity of expressing my thanks for all the work done jointly. I believe we can be reasonably pleased with ourselves. We certainly have not wasted time. Further, we have contributed to the creation of a more balanced Europe. Today’s Europe is better developed, it provides a better service for its citizens and it plays a more prominent role in the world.</p>

As a group, we must congratulate Mr Rack, who carried out a very difficult task. Let us not forget that the text that will emerge from this House today is a text that strongly reflects the contribution made by the European Parliament and its amendments. The first Commission version, as Commissioner de Palacio said, was somewhat too regulatory and prescriptive and it would have been difficult to enforce. I feel that we should be delighted to stress, on the one hand, the excellent work by the rapporteur and, on the other hand, this good example of Community legislation. When they want to, the three institutions are capable of working together and working well. I feel that this is an extremely important message, for our European citizens too, since the issue of road safety, as the Commissioner recalled, is something that we have long been concerned with in this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed, Commissioner, that we did not succeed in finishing off the proposal on driving licences but unfortunately there was not enough time for us to do so. I am also disappointed that in the next parliamentary term we will not, I am sorry to say, have your tenacity and constancy to wrap up the issues that remain open. Nonetheless, I am convinced that you will, in any case, contribute in other roles.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we still have to take a further step on this issue. A large part of the costs of this provision will fall on some countries of the Union in particular – at least 50% of these tunnels are in my country – and I believe that it would be useful, in the next parliamentary term, to find means to financially support this endeavour, which should not be left solely to individual Member States but must involve all the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done an excellent job, and has, in particular, been able to strike a balance between the costs connected with safety measures and the major safety measures which must be taken in tunnels in the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a brief personal comment to the Vice-President and discuss her personal contribution. Madam Vice-President, for many years there has been an often very hard, but also very fair cooperation and debate. You have indeed not always made it easy for everyone. While not exactly being a person who radiates meekness and readiness for compromise from the word go, you are a person with whom it is worthwhile to argue and find a compromise. In that sense, I would like to say that I agree with you entirely: in the last few years in the area of transport policy we have taken a very large number of important decisions, in which you and your staff have played a very important part, and for that you have my warm thanks. I assume that you will remain in the Commission and continue to be politically active, and perhaps we will have a little bit of time to argue with each other. In any event, it is a pleasure to argue with you, when we are dealing with the real issue. Thank you for your collaboration.</p>
