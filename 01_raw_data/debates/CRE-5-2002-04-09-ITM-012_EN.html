<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 October 2000, the Council of Ministers adopted its common position on this draft directive on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances, specifically pentabromodiphenyl ether, a flame retardant used – I would reiterate – almost exclusively in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam. PentaBDE builds up and remains in the environment, it escapes from the foam and enters our blood stream and nervous system via the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that the common position – as, in fact, was suggested by Parliament at the vote at first reading – is placing a ban on pentaBDE in all its forms, including when it is the residue from the manufacture of a related chemical product, namely octabromodiphenyl ether. This ban is due to come into force in July 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rest of the text is concerned, however, I would say that we still have a great deal of work to do. The Council, which is supporting the opinion of the Commission on this issue, has rejected Parliament’s proposal to extend the scope of the directive to cover all the polybromodiphenyl ethers on the market, namely octaBDE and decaBDE. We must make it clear there are two arguments for justifying this refusal, which a majority of the Member States opposes. The first is that we must wait for the final results of the risk assessments in progress; the second is that we must ensure, before any ban is placed on a flame retardant, that equally effective substitute products are available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that this is precisely the reasoning that Parliament followed at first reading, and also that used by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy during its vote on 21 March, with regard to decabromodiphenyl ether in both cases. In other words, by calling for a deferred ban on this substance to come into force no later than 1 January 2006, depending on the final results of the risk assessment, Parliament is taking into account the latest available scientific information forwarded by the United Kingdom, which is the Member State acting as rapporteur on the environmental aspects of the risk assessment. The British experts concluded with a proposal to the authorities responsible to consider the need to apply the precautionary principle to both octaBDE and to decaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is also responding to the Council and Commission’s desire to respect the rules laid down by the 1993 regulation on the assessment and control of existing substances, on the existence of substitutes and on the difficult balance that needed to be found between the obvious advantages in terms of safety in the event of fire, on the one hand, and the harmful effects of these products on the environment and health, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would point out that decaBDE, which constitutes 80% of bromine fire protection products, is a particularly resistant and effective flame retardant. In the United Kingdom in 2000 alone, 155 lives were saved and thousands of cases of severe burns were avoided thanks to these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on the Environment wanted to phase in the precautionary principle rather than apply it rigidly, as I said. This is the purpose of Amendment No 4, which was unanimously adopted, and it is also why I am opposed, as I was at first reading and during the vote in committee, to Amendments Nos 9 and 10 tabled by Mrs Schörling and Mr Sjöstedt. I am, however, in favour of Amendment No 7, tabled by these Members, which is much clearer in its wording in that it explicitly refers to decaBDE in the recitals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards octaBDE and its imminent ban, which I believe is justified, there is no further information to reassure us on this substance and Parliament is therefore unable to change its position adopted on 6 September 2001. The results of the risk assessments currently in progress forwarded by the French Government remain applicable; they are preliminary results revealing that octaBDE is harmful to human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further reason for our request to limit the marketing of this flame retardant which justifies the reintroduction of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, and that is that octaBDE is used in a fairly small number of products and can be replaced in many cases by decabromodyphenl ether, and this is why my fellow Members and myself call for the precautionary principle to prevail over all other considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I have some brief comments to put to the Commissioner. The Commission is developing programmes, greatly increasing the number of initiatives in order to ensure even greater levels of protection for human health and the environment. The new strategy on chemical products launched by your services is the best example of this. It would be a strong, reassuring signal if you made a commitment to implementing a risk reduction policy for all polybromodiphenyl ethers without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, of course, noted the progress that the Commission has made in this area with its declaration attached to the minutes of the common position, where it undertakes to consider as a matter of urgency the need for a new proposal to restrict the marketing and use of octaBDE and decaBDE, but the conditions applied – namely, that it is still necessary to wait for the results of the risk assessments – mean, in this case, that the timetable for introducing urgent measures is at risk of being further overloaded. Where scientific doubt persists, it is necessary to make a political choice. That is why I think that we do not need to wait for a never-ending story to unfold to analyse the risks but to unite and promote a balanced solution. The most important thing is to reconcile the immediate safety of our citizens from fire risks with the longer-term benefits for public health and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we should be asking ourselves what we actually need this incredibly important product for. PentaBDE is used exclusively in the manufacture of flexible foam for furniture and upholstery. This is certainly a highly important area. The Council common position is generally in line with the Commission's amended proposal, and I am delighted that the Council welcomes the amendment removing the derogation for octaBDE with a pentaBDE content of less than 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also to be welcomed that the Council has partly accepted an amendment demanding that octaBDE with a pentaBDE content of over 0.1% should no longer be tolerated in view of the restrictions on the use of pentaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">During the second reading in committee, my group fully supported all four amendments tabled by the rapporteur, as we also did at first reading, the aim of these being to achieve a ban on octaBDE. We will of course also support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. As I am only speaking on behalf of Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, I shall take the liberty of using her words as regards the remaining amendments, which my group will not be supporting. She felt that the other amendments were ‘pure nonsense’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an interesting issue. These substances are dangerous, they are toxic. But they also have an extremely useful and important role in that they save lives in their role as fire-retardants. There is absolutely no question about that fact. We have to very carefully consider how we deal with these substances. It is quite clear that penta and probably octa are really not necessary and that the risks they pose to the environment and human health do not justify their continued use as flame-retardants.</p>
<p class="contents">But I urge Parliament to pause for a moment and think seriously about what alternatives there are to these very useful flame retardants. Can we still use deca in a sensible and serious way? Will the risk assessments finally rule out its use? We simply do not know because we have not had the risk assessments. The Commission has to press Member States to come forward with them as quickly as possible. We want this issue resolved. We want to know exactly what to do with these substances. For the moment it is an open question. I hope that we use our intelligence in this question and realise the importance of these substances in protecting human life as flame-retardants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental policy and legislation really need a bit of ‘prime time’ here in Parliament. It is a big responsibility to take decisions about public health and the environment that are to apply for a long time into the future. This directive and the report on brominated flame retardants are good examples of this responsibility’s being exercised.</p>
<p class="contents">After the first reading in September 2001, there was a reappraisal of the EU’s risk assessments in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE. That took place in November of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Chemicals Bureau believes that, when it comes to oktaBDE and dekaBDE, the risk assessment and situation are now the same as they were for pentaBDE, when the result was a total ban.</p>
<p class="contents">These substances are persistent and bioaccumulative. The scientific proofs in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE are now so alarming in terms of public health and the environment that the Bureau has recommended the Member States to take a political decision, that is to say to use the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament, we must also accept our responsibility as co-legislators. Following the reappraisal and the new risk assessment, we must also arrange for the precautionary principle to prevail. Those of us from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists are therefore re-tabling Amendments Nos 7 to 10, according to which dekaBDE too must no longer be used. There is no reason to wait any longer. There are substitutes. In 80 per cent of cases, the use of brominated flame retardants involves the use of dekaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the new knowledge we have acquired, we cannot continue to gamble with the environment and public health. We therefore hope that the political groups will vote in favour of the amendments and that Commissioner Wallström too will confirm that the precautionary principle is to be applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just like Mrs Schörling, I nonetheless believe that we now have arguments for being able to go still further. Now, we have arguments for banning not only pentaBDE and oktaBDE but also dekaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to wait for the risk assessments, we are in danger of having to wait too long. Moreover, we are in possession of the arguments right now, and we know that these substances, which are hazardous, accumulate in the human body and are increasingly present in our living environment. We really have all the arguments needed for taking a decision right now.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also alternatives to these brominated flame retardants, which are otherwise in danger of becoming a major health problem in the future. Just like Mr Bowe, I think we must take an intelligent decision which, in this case, means daring to take the lead and ban what we know to be hazardous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After decades of industrial use, we find them everywhere, including in fish, birds’ eggs, polar bears, agricultural products and mother's milk. It might be imagined that this information had been taken from a paper written by fundamentalist environmental organisations, but that is not the case. One of the signatories of the paper is the Director-General of the Swedish emergency services authority, comprised of experts on, for example, fire protection, and that authority too is prepared to say that flame retardants have had their day.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this view should be listened to, for the major argument in the debate against a ban on oktaBDE and dekaBDE is that we cannot expose people to the danger involved in not using adequate flame retardants in buildings, furniture etc. At the same time, we know, however, that there are substitutes, that there is the possibility of using other materials and that there is the ability to produce in different ways than we do today. In a way, it is almost absurd that we are compelled to use chemicals to combat those chemicals we use in our buildings today. The reason our products burn as well as they do is that we already use chemicals in them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should have a proper think and try, for all that, to make a serious effort also to ban oktaBDE and dekaBDE. The issue is one of how long we have to wait, following the assessment, before a ban or a restriction on the use of oktaBDE and dekaBDE is introduced. The Commission has nonetheless said that it is prepared to act quickly. So how quickly is it prepared to act? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is certainly an important directive, involving a ban on the use of the substance pentabromodiphenyl, or pentaBDE, which a risk assessment has revealed constitutes an environmental risk. The substance accumulates in nature and, as has already been pointed out, it has been found in mother’s milk. The directive is far-reaching, covering all uses of pentaBDE and all types of goods containing this substance. The directive is based on the precautionary principle. The proposed directive does not entail the risk of fires starting or an increase in risks to the environment, because there are already suitable alternatives available.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand and share the anxiety felt by MEPs regarding other, closely related substances not included in the original area of application of the proposed directive, and I wish to comment on this, as well as on the issue of timing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively investigating the risks presented by the two closely related substances, oktaBDE and dekaBDE, as well as the risks which might arise due to fire if these substances were to be banned from the market. The Commission’s attitude is that we must minimise the overall risks. We shall soon have finished this risk assessment in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE, and we expect to have information before the end of the year about the consequences of banning these substances in terms both of a reduction in the chemical risk and a possible increase in the risks due to fires.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the results of this work, the Commission will table a new proposal at the beginning of next year, that is to say at the beginning of 2003. The Commission will also give clear instructions to all the parties concerned to hurry up and complete the assessments, if possible before the end of the year. Against this background, it is not now possible for the Commission to approve those of Parliament’s amendments designed to extend the scope of the proposed directive to include a total and immediate ban on oktaBDE and dekaBDE as well. The amendments concerned are numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the Commission able to approve the amendment according to which there would be a total ban on dekaBDE as from 1 January 2006 if the risk assessment were to show that there are risks associated with the substance. That is because it would be possible for suitable measures to enter into force much sooner than 2006 if these should prove necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure MEPs that, at the first possible opportunity, the Commission will take action in relation to these substances so that the precautionary principle is complied with. I also hope that MEPs are aware of the fact that the Commission has proposed a ban on these three substances – penta-, okta- and dekadiphenyls – in our proposal for a directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. We are concerned here with Mr Florenz’s report, which has also been debated during this sitting. Let me emphasise that the Commission will ensure that the proposal we shall table early next year concerning oktaBDE and dekaBDE will be compatible with our proposal to restrict hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the risk assessment in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE is far advanced, it will be possible, if need be, for the Commission to take measures much earlier than in 2006. Once the risk assessments have been concluded and an investigation made into the availability of replacement products, it should be possible to establish in which cases there are risks associated with use of the substances. Suitable measures can then be taken immediately. Because the assessments will be ready shortly, it will be possible for the measures decided upon to begin to be applied well before 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the assurances I have now given on behalf of the Commission, I look forward to this very urgent draft law’s being adopted as soon as possible. I should like to thank MEPs for this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
