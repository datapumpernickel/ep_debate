<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were all alarmed and dismayed to learn, three weeks ago, that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was developing a secret programme to enrich uranium for military purposes. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea made this admission during a visit to Pyongyang by a delegation from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is a flagrant violation of the commitments entered into by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under four different international agreements on nuclear energy. The so-called 1994 framework agreement was one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has already voiced the European Union’s disquiet. The Union expressed its deep concern in a statement on 18 October 2002. The Union also urged the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to honour its international commitments on non-proliferation, to freeze its nuclear weapons programme, and to invite verification.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement emphasised that North Korea’s failure to honour its commitments put the KEDO programme in jeopardy. In addition, the Union expressed the hope that the peace process in the Korean peninsula would not be adversely affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement ended by reiterating the European Union’s commitment to cooperate with all the interested parties in the search for a peaceful solution. I should point out that similar messages were conveyed to the Deputy Foreign Minister. The latter met with Commission officials the very day after the news broke.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that, through Euratom, the European Union has contributed a total of EUR 75 million over the first five years of the KEDO programme. The programme was set up and implemented between 1996 and 2000. The Union is also committed to annual payments of EUR 20 million between 2001 and 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">To put these sums into perspective, I would like to remind you that the Republic of Korea’s contribution amounts to over three thousand million United States dollars. Japan’s contribution, however, is approximately one thousand. As for the United States, to date it has provided financial support worth four hundred million dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you too, that the framework agreement has been the subject of criticism in certain circles in the United States and by the North Koreans themselves. Nonetheless, the aim of freezing the production of plutonium in Pyongyang had been achieved. We must not forget that had that not been the case, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would quite simply have obtained enough plutonium to manufacture dozens of nuclear bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">A new threat to the security of the region has emerged as a result of these recent revelations on a uranium enrichment programme for military purposes. This is perceived as a threat to security even though uranium enrichment is in all probability a slower and more difficult method of obtaining material suitable for military purposes than resorting to plutonium that could be produced in Pyongyang. Both parties agree that any new agreement must be reached through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the European Union is currently consulting its main partners, namely the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. The consultations aim to establish the most effective course of action in pursuit of the overall aim which is quite simply to prevent nuclear proliferation and to ensure that North Korea does not come into possession of weapons of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as those other countries providing substantially greater financial support to the KEDO programme continue to weigh up their options, it seems to me quite clear that the European Union should not adopt a definitive position on the future of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe we must take concerted action along with our friends and allies. Together, we should aim to persuade the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to honour its undertakings regarding nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the approach we should adopt. At the same time, however, we must ensure that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectors in Pyongyang are able to continue their monitoring duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I regret I am currently unable to provide further information. Nonetheless, I should like to emphasise once again that we must give priority to achieving our common aim and maintaining a coordinated approach along with the other participants in the KEDO programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What lies behind this declaration? Is it an act aiming at dialogue as some seem to think? Or is it a provocative act, an attempt to blackmail in order to get money in exchange for a behaviour – renouncing nuclear power – that it should adopt in any case? Moreover, yesterday, North Korea reinforced its blackmail through another threat: it will re-start missile testing if it feels the negotiations with Japan are unsatisfactory. This is to say that, if North Korea does not obtain millions of dollars in exchange, it will not respect its promises, as it has already demonstrated on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">How should we behave towards North Korea now? It seems to me that, above all, we should have sent a clear message – things have changed and nothing will be the same. This is why I was against the decision to send a letter to North Korea to reconfirm the invitation for the Parliamentary delegation to come to Brussels this week. Maybe we should not have sent it since the invitation was turned down.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has little influence on North Korea. As we heard from Mrs de Palacio, our monetary contribution to KEDO is minimal in comparison with that of other partners. I think that the Commissioner was right to say that we must aim to develop cooperation between the actors in the area so as to oblige North Korea to respect international rules, although I doubt this will happen with the current regime still in power.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which we are presenting today is built on those premises and is a result of a compromise reached by the major political groups in Parliament. I would have preferred it to be tougher on North Korea, but it still represents an acceptable compromise between the need to maintain an open dialogue and the necessity to press Pyongyang into giving up its nuclear and missile programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that everyone will agree that it would be useful after yesterday's developments to move an oral amendment strongly condemning the new threat of renewed missile testing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no final proof that they have weapons-grade plutonium available and, of course, I support the compromise resolution between a number of groups in this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully and firmly agree with the trilateral statement made by President Bush, Prime Minister Koizumi and President Kim Dae-jung at the APEC Summit meeting at the weekend calling on North Korea to dismantle its admitted uranium enrichment programme in a prompt and verifiable manner and to come into full compliance with all international obligations in conformity with North Korea's recent commitment in the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we cannot be entirely blind to the fact that the 1994 framework agreement has not been fulfilled in its entirety by the US either. The first reactor from KEDO scheduled to be online by the end of next year is currently running seven years late. Deliveries of heavy fuel oil, the US contribution to KEDO, have, in the past at least, been sporadic. Most importantly, the US commitment in 1994 to normalise relations, lift the embargo on North Korea – which has been in place for 50 years – and lift the nuclear threat have still not been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the North Korean offer to engage in dialogue on all outstanding issues, which may mean that this becomes an opportunity rather than a threat. We need to look at the issue of missile sales and testing, and the linked inevitable missile exports. We must look at the signing of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention by North Korea and outstanding problems around the issue of abductees from Japan. Also, of course, we must look for a continuation of the human rights dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I hope that the EU, as the only entity with diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, Japan, the US and with the DPRK, will help to initiate such a dialogue, if possible in concert with the other key actor in the region – China. We must maintain humanitarian aid and continue the training of North Korean technicians in Europe if only to take this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Two small corrections: firstly, Mr Gawronski said the North Koreans refused our invitation. This was not the case. They only had four days notice and asked for it to be postponed until a later date. Secondly, the meeting scheduled for 11 November 2002 will not now take place and I hope we can move an oral amendment to make the point more general in terms of wanting EU involvement at all levels in these discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU believed it could use so-called peaceful civil nuclear power to bribe a totalitarian regime to refrain from developing nuclear weapons. This naïve confidence in nuclear solutions to serious problems has now given rise to a backlash and caused the EU to appear in an embarrassing and ridiculous light.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has maintained right from the beginning that the KEDO project has been badly thought out. We have proved to have been horribly right. Unfortunately, it appears as if neither the Commission nor the political groups in Parliament that support nuclear power are managing to look the truth in the face, draw the logical conclusions from the KEDO fiasco and abandon the project. What is missing from the joint motion for a resolution is a clear acknowledgement of the fact that KEDO has been wrongly constructed, badly thought out, dangerous and counter-productive right from the start. Support for North Korea’s seriously afflicted people must be provided in quite different forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must clearly and openly acknowledge its <span class="italic">fatal</span> mistake in joining KEDO and inform other KEDO members that it is withdrawing from the project. The fact is that those responsible for KEDO should be ashamed of themselves. Certainly, there is a need to proceed carefully so as not to damage the so-called Sunshine Policy, and certainly there is a need to talk with the Pyongyang leadership in order to drive the normalisation process forward. There is no need, however, desperately to cling to so completely ill-conceived and discredited a project as KEDO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this step was to support the Sunshine Policy pioneered by the South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung, who also had the backing of the international community. We were preceded by the American Secretary of State, Madeleine Allbright. All these steps shared the aim of normalising the situation in North Korea through constructive dialogue. It should be pointed out that since then almost all our Member States as well as the European Union itself have established diplomatic relations with North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, of course, we are disappointed, not to say furious, about the revelations made by the North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister, the very man who was our main contact, regarding the secret development of the country’s nuclear programme for military ends. We must react strongly to this deceitful approach adopted by North Korea, which is in flagrant violation of the agreements concluded since 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask the Commission and the Council to reassess the KEDO project in light of these events. To this end, we must coordinate our stance with that of the main partners in the KEDO Council, in other words, South Korea, Japan and the United States. We must demand full compliance with the agreements concluded and ongoing inspection by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is for President Kim Dae-Jung’s Sunshine Policy to be implemented, but for this to take place, dialogue must be pursued, but this dialogue must also be frank and fair. In particular, North Korea must be aware that this dialogue can only take place if it declares itself ready to stop – once and for all - any development of nuclear weapons, proceeds to dismantle this programme swiftly and measurably, agrees to ongoing controls and inspections and accepts and complies with international agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a history of political assassination, blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years back. It has blown up a South Korean civilian airliner. It has kidnapped innocent Japanese civilians, most of whom have died in mysterious circumstances. Most recently, it has starved many of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies. It remains a failing and rogue state which means that the West, including the European Union, must tread very carefully in its attempts to engage with North Korea and bring it out of the cold.</p>
<p class="contents">The DPRK agreed in 1994 to freeze and dismantle its nuclear programme, and by its recent admission of possession of nuclear weapons it has clearly breached the non-proliferation treaty and the agreed framework of KEDO. I believe it is right to call this regime part of the axis of evil. Unlike Iraq, which has yet to acquire nuclear weapons, it is now too late to do anything militarily to prevent its nuclear proliferation. Every pressure must be brought to bear to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors back in. Pakistan, our ally in the war on terrorism, should also be challenged on its role in this weapons programme, as it allegedly provided an exchange for North Korean missiles to weaponise its own nuclear bomb. China's role needs scrutiny and that country must be reminded that it is officially opposed to the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">If the DPRK does not agree to reverse its policy and disarm in terms of its nuclear weapons then the whole KEDO contribution by the European Union should be terminated. I support placing the budgetary line as a first step in the reserve to be released according to diplomatic progress. Nevertheless, humanitarian aid must continue through the World Food Programme and ECHO. The European Union is one of the few bodies to have formal relations with this country and must use its leverage and access to its government to resolve this situation satisfactorily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
