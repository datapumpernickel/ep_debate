<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on issues that are at the forefront of our concerns. On 12 October, when Parliament expressed its wish to have this debate, I made myself available on the very same day and I was ready to go to Parliament the same evening. Unfortunately it was not possible to make a suitable agenda arrangement. I am glad that it is now possible to have this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate was triggered by a case pending in the Swedish and European courts. It concerns what is known as the Laval case. I realise that there are strong political sensitivities on all sides and difficult issues to be dealt with. I have personally discussed this case with the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Latvia and I am fully aware of the importance that is attached to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is still waiting for the European Court to forward to us the question referred for a preliminary ruling. We will then examine the case carefully and submit our views in an <span class="italic">amicus curiae </span>brief to the Court, as we do in all proceedings of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, once the Court has given its judgment the Commission is at the disposal of all parties to analyse the situation and possible solutions as required. Given that it was possible to find equitable solutions in other situations, of which the posting of workers directive is but one example, the Commission remains convinced that it is possible to reconcile the four freedoms under the European Treaties with the different social models chosen by the Member States. The role of the Commission is to ensure that both the social<span class="italic"> acquis</span> and the internal market legislation are respected and fully implemented in all Member States, without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of principle, the Commission respects the different social models chosen by the Member States. It recognises that the Swedish model has a successful record of combining high employment with flexibility for companies and also with social justice. The Swedish system is clearly a model which provides adaptability in a globalised society. In particular the Commission acknowledges that, in view of its successful record, Sweden did not feel it necessary to request transitional periods for the access of workers from the new Member States to the Swedish labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues raised must also be seen in their broader economic and political context. They demonstrate the need to advance our agenda for growth and jobs in order to achieve stronger social and economic cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning, this debate was triggered by a court case. First and foremost we should wait for the court to deliver its judgment. Let me make it clear: this Parliament is not a court, it is a political body and a political debate is needed. This is a matter of substance, not just of legal interpretation. The essential questions are clear. Are we for or against solidarity in an enlarged Union? Are we for or against economic and social cohesion to reduce imbalances in a Union of 25 members? Are we for or against the free movement of workers, with full respect for the national legislation and social frameworks of the Member States? Are we for or against a European budget capable of effectively promoting economic and social cohesion? Those are the questions that lie behind this debate and on which we need to express our views.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be prepared for cases like this in the future. In an enlarged Union, these problems might well arise. It is interesting to recall that in 1986, when Spain and Portugal became members of the European Community, Spanish and Portuguese workers were seen as a threat by many of the existing European Community members. The solution was not protection within each market but the promotion of economic and social cohesion. The general issue, therefore, is how we reduce imbalances and actively promote prosperity, so that our Union is really united and has no artificial divisions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I hope that all those who are for social solidarity, social cohesion and economic cohesion will fight for the ambitious financial perspectives and active social and economic cohesion policy we need in an enlarged Europe. We need to promote union, not artificial boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now give the floor to Commissioner McCreevy. As you know, as the Commissioner for the Internal Market he has special responsibility for defending the internal market principles that are enshrined in our Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. Mr President, let me confirm that the Commission does not call into question the organisation of labour relations and the system of collective agreements in Sweden or indeed any other Member State. It is entirely a matter for each Member State to determine how labour relations are organised and whether or not its system includes collective bargaining. The Commission recognises the important role that collective agreements play in bringing stability and predictability to economic and social relations in the many Member States that utilise these methods.</p>
<p class="contents">At the opening of the Brussels sitting earlier this month, reference was made to the fact that I had recently stated that the Scandinavian model of collective agreements was not compatible with the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who know me will be very much aware that I have vigorously supported collective agreements in the Member State I know best. In my home country, I have been directly involved in more national partnership negotiations than any previous Irish Minister for Finance. In my time in that office, I was regarded, together with my Prime Minister, as the leading government defender of the <span class="italic">model</span> of Irish social partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">During a recent visit to a number of Member States, including Latvia and Sweden, the press asked me about the ongoing investigation in what is known as the Laval case. It is a case involving a Latvian construction company, Laval, that won a tender to build a school in Vaxholm in Sweden. As a result of a dispute on whether Laval had to sign up to the Swedish collective agreement and whether it had to pay the average Swedish wage in the construction sector, the Swedish construction trade union blocked the construction site. The action taken by the Swedish construction trade union eventually led Laval to terminate the contract and the company ultimately went bankrupt. The matter was brought before the Swedish Labour Court, which in turn referred the matter to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Swedish Labour Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice demonstrates that the legal situation is complicated. Whether the Swedish authorities and the trade union were right in how they handled this case will be determined by the Swedish Labour Court in the light of the ruling that will be given by the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be invited to present its analysis of the situation and all the legal elements, including Article 49 of the Treaty on the freedom to provide services and the application of the posted workers directive. This analysis is complex and will take some time. The Commission has not yet formed a view on this. Those are the facts of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the broader question of how the Commission sees the development of the internal market and the European social model, let me stress that, for the Commission, the development of the internal market and the preservation of the European social model go hand in hand. They are not mutually exclusive; they reinforce each other. The internal market creates new opportunities for businesses, consumers and workers. This allows the preservation and further development of social rights, in accordance with the collective preferences of each individual Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has an onerous duty in making sure that the basic rights and freedoms set down in the Treaty are respected throughout the Union. As guardian of the internal market, I exercise my responsibilities in an even-handed manner. To be credible, there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it extraordinary that I should have to justify remarks I made on an incident that raise questions about its compatibility with Article 49 of the Treaty. I was not the first to raise this question. It was the Swedish Labour court that asked whether there is incompatibility with Community law, in particular the posting of workers directive, Article 49 on the free movement of services and Article 12 on non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">This happens to be a ‘sensitive’ issue in a Member State. But does the mere fact that an issue is sensitive deprive me of my right to express a view or carry out my duty? I believe in the necessity for the Commission to be impartial and fair in the exercise of its duties. I will continue to voice my opinions loud and clear. I do not care if it means upsetting some people. I passionately believe in the primary role of the Commission to ensure the rules of the Treaty are applied and I will vigorously defend that role. I have sworn to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are 25 Member States in the Union. I make no distinction between them. Just because Latvia is a new Member State and one of the smallest, that does not mean its complaints are less important. Latvian trade union members are entitled to have their interests defended as much as Swedish trade union members.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Neither I nor the Commission call into question the social model of any Member State or the way in which it organises labour relations. One of the strengths of the Union is its diversity. I have my views about what is good for the economy. I have never hidden these views. I also have my views about how the challenges and opportunities arising from globalisation should be addressed and I do not believe it is an option to maintain barriers and try to pretend that competition does not exist, or can be kept outside the borders.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have never said that there is a single recipe for running every economy. There is no single recipe for organising labour relations and there is no single recipe for a social model. What works in one country might not work for another. I will therefore not express any view on whether the social model of one Member State is better or worse than that of another. That is a matter for political choice in each country and I know that every system will find supporters and critics. The truth lies, most of the time, in the middle. No single system has only advantages. Every system and every choice has downsides. Choices and preferences may also change. What is good now may not necessarily be so in five years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject being discussed today is not whether the social system of a country is under threat or whether that system is an example to others. The real issue for me is what we mean by an internal market. What do Article 49 of the Treaty and the freedom to provide services mean? What do Article 12 and the principle of non-discrimination mean?</p>
<p class="contents">No one has questioned the enormous benefits the internal market brings, the extra growth and the extra jobs it has created. We should not be afraid of the internal market. We should embrace it. We have a Union of 25 Member States. The world is not waiting for us to take advantage of the internal market we live in. Others will do it for us if we do not wake up. I will defend the rights laid down in the Treaty. I will continue to apply its provisions in an even-handed way. But if members of this House expect me to creep around quietly and not upset some Member States and some Members of the European Parliament, then I am afraid that they are going to be disappointed.</p>

The President of the Commission has indicated that he was very much prepared to appear in Brussels, as, indeed, he is obliged to do when Parliament demands it. That he did not has something to do with those who were asking him to do so, and nothing whatever with him, so we thank him for doing his duty and being here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner McCreevy’s statements in Stockholm were not intended to call into question the Swedish social model, or to attack the Swedish social partners’ right to determine wages. The EU Services Directive was not a point at issue, nor was he talking about any decision to be taken by Parliament, the Council or the Commission; on the contrary, he was referring to a case before the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">When Commissioner McCreevy, at the beginning of October, told an audience in Stockholm that the Commission supported a Latvian building firm in its dispute with a Swedish building workers’ trade union, he was doing what the Commission is obliged to do by the Treaties, that being to act as the guardian of the law and of rights – in this instance, the right to the freedom to provide services. In so doing, far from calling into question Sweden’s traditional system of collective agreements, he was trying to make it clear that this system, like all others, has to respond to the establishment of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to point out that other countries – for example, the country from which Mr Schulz comes – have already responded by availing themselves of the provisions made by the Posting of Workers Directive for the building sector, or of the option provided for in the accession negotiations, namely of enacting transitional regulations for workers from the states that most recently joined the EU. It is evident that the Swedish Government is trying to draw attention away from its own failings.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is no other explanation for the attempt by the Swedish Minister for the Economy to exert pressure on the European institutions by threatening to withdraw his country’s support for the Services Directive. His motives are transparent and his actions unacceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Services Directive has nothing whatever to do with the case under consideration. What is at issue is the interpretation of the law as it stands, which nobody wants to change. I would like to say, on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that nobody in our ranks has any desire to use the Services Directive to alter labour law or the laws on collective bargaining, and certainly not to impose restrictions upon them. Those who make assertions to the contrary are trying to frighten people and whip up anti-European sentiment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, be very sensitive and take people’s concerns seriously. That was brought home to us by the two failed referendums earlier this year. There is nothing clever, though, about politicians who keep trying to shift blame towards Brussels and get it to carry the can. If statements by a Member of the Commission are used as a pretext for covering up one’s own mistakes and omissions, then that is something of which this House cannot approve.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Central and Eastern Europe have stood up for freedom, democracy and self-determination, and have done so with great success. In so doing, they have won for themselves the right to become members of the community that is the European Union. As we see it, there is no doubt whatever that they can therefore lay claim to all the rights associated with that status, and must not be treated as second-class Europeans. That is what this is about. By that shall we be judged. We will not allow this European Community to be divided up, with citizens and states allotted to first or second class within it; on the contrary, we are one single common European Union, and, as such, we practise solidarity. We defend our social model, and the internal market forms part of it, for it offers us the only opportunity to make ourselves competitive on a global scale. These are the principles by which our group stands.</p>

Far from it standing in the centre, in the middle ground of European politics, it has become apparent this morning that it – not all its Members, but Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso – have taken up an unequivocal stance and set a right-wing, neo-liberal course, against which my Group campaigns – today, tomorrow and every other day.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is true to say that we welcome all the new states of the European Union – all of them. We Social Democrats are fighting for Romania and Bulgaria as well, and we urge you to do likewise, with the same dedication, but the one reason why we welcome them is that we want social progress in Europe and we want the social standards we have achieved to be secured. We do not want Swedish workers to be played off against their Latvian counterparts, but you do; that is how you go about destroying Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In preparing us for today’s debate, the chairman of the European Socialist Party, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, recast this topic in the form of three simple questions. Those three questions I shall now put to you, and I want clear answers to them from you.</p>
<p class="contents">Here comes the first question, Mr President of the Commission: does the Commission take the view that trade unions – those in Sweden, for example – have the right to campaign in defence of collective agreements, which may involve them taking strike action?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does the Commission take the view that the Nordic version of the social model is compatible with the rules of the internal market? I put this question to you, Mr Barroso, for to judge by what I hear Commissioner McCreevy saying, it is apparently not. The message we get from Commissioner McCreevy is that, in the event of his interpretation of Article 49 becoming accepted, there is no longer any room in Europe for the Swedish model. Our response to that, Mr McCreevy, is that your interpretation of Article 49 will not prevail in Europe, at any rate not while the Social Democrats in this House have any say in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The third question we want to put to you, Mr Barroso, is this: we need an unequivocal statement as to what the Commission’s position is in relation to the European Court of Justice in the Vaxholm case. Where, in fact, do you stand on that?</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why we have demanded the President of the Commission’s and the Commissioner’s presence here is that this debate is about nothing more and nothing less than the question of in which direction we want to develop this European Union of ours, of what this European Union’s purpose is.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens have their own worries and their own aspirations; these they address not only to us in this House, but also to the Commission. The people of Europe want employment, but not at the price of Chinese wages and Asian working conditions. They want living wages from secure jobs, an income with which they can achieve some sort of workable and secure future for themselves and for their children. That is what the European social model is, and that is what we want to defend.</p>
<p class="contents">What I hear from you, though, Mr McCreevy, is that the free market in Europe means that the lowest standards for incomes, the lowest standards for social security and the lowest standards for workers’ rights are the best way of promoting competition and growth and that they must prevail. No, that is the wrong way to go about it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European social model, which involves partnership between capital and labour, is a recipe for success. Let me repeat that we want to put our Latvian and Czech comrades in a stronger position; my colleague Mr Falbr, who is a Czech trade unionist, will shortly have something to say about that. European social policy cannot have the driving down of wages as its objective. Far from it: one of the effects of the EU’s structural policy is to unleash progress and economic growth in the new Member States, in the Baltic states, in Slovakia or Slovenia, and this technical advance, this process of economic growth, must be inseparable from the workers’ sharing in this growth, and what that means is higher wages and more trade union rights for the workers in those countries, rather than fewer rights in Sweden and lower and lower standards. That would be a system after Mr McCreevy’s heart, and we will not have it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we expect of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that you should now come out and say, once and for all, where you stand. Last week, you delivered a speech on social policy, in which you proposed, indeed demanded, the establishment of an intervention fund. That is something we support, with the proviso that such an intervention fund must not be used for the victims of Commissioner McCreevy’s policies. To that we are opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to say once and for all what your Commission stands for; if you want to put your commitment to the European social model beyond doubt, then you must, at last, put the brakes on Charlie McCreevy, Neelie Kroes, and other members of your Commission. You have the means to do so, and if you do it, you can count on our support, but if your system is about continuing the downgrading of mobility and social standards in Europe, then your Commission will have to contend with the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House.</p>

A Europe that is open to the world, dynamic and competitive, or one which seeks to shelter its industry and workforce from globalisation? A Europe which can offer security, prosperity and opportunity to its citizens, or one which, enslaved to the precepts of the past, slides further into recession?</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is fundamental to Europeans; it must be conducted honestly, rationally and directly. It is therefore disappointing that those who have brought Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso here today seem more interested in stalling debate than furthering it, perhaps for the sake of a few more votes in the upcoming Swedish election. They accuse the Commission of being off-centre. Have they not noticed that the centre of opinion has shifted? Their political manoeuvring aims not only to derail the Services Directive; it is aimed at one of the fundamental pillars of the Treaty: the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McCreevy should not be made the scapegoat for their scepticism. As Commissioner for the Internal Market, he has a duty to defend it against its detractors. Nor should his comments be seen as an attack on the Swedish social model, which Liberals have defended for its ability to balance the brutality of the marketplace with a sizeable social safety net. They should be seen as an attack on the Swedish Builders Federation’s hypocrisy, xenophobia and protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Laval bid in a fair and open competition for that contract, fulfilling public procurement criteria. The company has a collective agreement with its workers, just as Swedish employers have with theirs. What is more, when challenged by the unions over labour rates, Laval offered to raise its wages to the level agreed by the Swedish collective agreement. However, that was not good enough for the union. It demanded that the rates should be the Stockholm average, rather than the Swedish national average. Finally, in a breathtaking lack of worker solidarity, that union prevented work from going ahead, which led to the company withdrawing from the contract and filing for bankruptcy. Now Latvian workers are out of a job thanks to the Swedish trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Is that situation the fault of Laval, or is it the fault of a syndicate which puts protecting Swedish jobs ahead of the common market principles we have signed up to?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by turning inwards and embracing protectionism that we will overcome sluggish economic growth and compete with China and India. The British historian James Anthony Froude once wrote that the practical effect of a belief is the test of its soundness. What better rebuke to the defenders of protectionism than this sorry affair? Perhaps we should not be surprised that Liberal economic and social thought is in the ascendant. One reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternatives.</p>

You maintain that you accept the Nordic model’s collective agreements but, at the same time, you wish to undermine them with your legislation. You must realise that our legislative objective is to protect each worker against unfair working conditions, not Swedish workers against Latvian workers.</p>
<p class="contents">You are making the most common mistake of all among EU politicians. You believe that something that worked in your own country for a certain period – your one-sided policy on growth and the internal market, through which Irish finance ministers succeeded for a time in reducing unemployment and increasing income – has to operate in the EU for evermore. That policy depended, however, on certain temporary, national and accidental circumstances. Progress was made not because of, but in spite of, deficient social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, we have managed to make some tough adjustments because of the security provided to us by forms of social protection. The Nordic model too is based, however, on unique basic conditions that cannot be exported to the EU as a whole with the help of legislation. The right thing is to learn from each other but to allow the legislation to permit adjustments according to the basic conditions that prevail in each region. Otherwise, we shall end up with a centrally administered form of ‘eurosclerosis’.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is like a football team. As coach, you see that you have a good player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so you come to the conclusion that all players should wear shoes his size and that you need to have 11 attackers in your team. With tactics like that, our football team would lose against both India and China. Instead, you need to see each player’s potential for development and what each can give to the team and to do so without crushing players’ individual creativity as long as they follow the basic rules of the game. Only then will there be a chance of winning the World Cup.</p>

How could we, on the left, accept a concept of Europe founded on creating competition among workers and on organising social dumping? It is exactly this kind of policy that we have in mind when we say ‘no’ to liberal Europe. What really grates is the fact that that brutal agitator, Mr McCreevy, and all those who share his opinions unfortunately can rely on rules in force in the EU in giving their support to a Latvian business claiming not to know about Sweden’s system of collective agreements and in applying more restrictive social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision to which, in this case, the Latvian service provider and its promoters in Brussels are referring is called mutual recognition, which was introduced into Community law, via the case law of the Court of Justice, in 1979 for the free circulation of goods and was then expanded to incorporate services around 15 years ago. This is a strategic choice. Instead of legislating on upwards social harmonisation, the market and competition are being allowed to pull the social <span class="italic">acquis </span>downwards: in Community jargon, this is what is known as better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission issued in 1999 a communication to Parliament and to the Council that was extremely explicit on this matter. I quote: ‘The application of mutual recognition is fully consistent with the Single Market philosophy according to which the rules of the Member State of origin normally prevail, and the Member State of destination can only derogate from that rule under very strict conditions challenging the overriding requirements of general public importance, such as health care, consumer protection or the environment.’ With the most recent enlargement, this rule has become explosive: the more social disparities increase among Member States, the more they reveal the diabolical consequences of this rule. From now on, everything will depend on what the Court considers to come under the ‘overriding requirements of general public importance’. It is therefore not only a question of attacking Mr McCreevy’s zeal, but also of opposing the harmful provisions themselves of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. From now on, let us consider this matter from the perspective of the forthcoming votes on the draft Bolkestein Directive, whatever Mr Poettering might have to say about it, and let us use this experience more generally to enhance our collective thoughts on the future of Europe.</p>

It is unfortunate that we have not been able to utilise our time with them to discuss the document which they presented to the Conference of Presidents last week with regard to the future European social model. The reason why we are not discussing upcoming events, where we can have influence with regard to decisions that will be taken by the 25 Member States, is because certain Members of this House want to re-run previous battles, previous elections, and to try to insist in future elections. These arguments and this debate are predicated not on real divergence of opinion with regard to a better form of social model, but merely on maintaining an archaic, protectionist system. When you fail to win the argument, you then attack the man: you carry out a personal attack because of his accent, because of the way in which he expresses himself. That is the most despicable form of political discourse or activity that I have ever come across.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the clear facts before us. We have a statement by the Commission that the social model of each Member State is its own business. Questions concerning collective bargaining or collective agreements are a matter for the Member States themselves and not for anyone else. The Commission has reiterated what we have known since 1969: the Commission’s role is to defend the European Treaties, whether it be Article 49, Article 21, Article 95 or Article 99. We also have a new document from the Commission, agreed by the College, which puts forward the best parts of the social models that are available to us within the European Union and states that this should be our minimum standard, our starting point. But what do we see happening? We see Member State governments – the Swedish Government in particular – utilising an opportunity given to it by the Socialist Group in this Parliament to express its opposition to the Services Directive when, for three years, it has been in favour of that directive. We now have a situation where Members are standing up in this House to say that they are defending workers’ rights in Latvia as well as in Sweden, despite the fact that the only exact information we have is that Latvian workers have lost their jobs because of the actions of some Swedish governments and trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not behove the future negotiations and discussions on behalf of Europe that, within this House, we cannot even set down proper debating time to discuss real issues rather than abstract principles.</p>

<p class="contents">Thirdly, as a Christian Democrat, I regard the socially-oriented market economy as the principle on which politics, my politics, our politics, are based. In this social market economy, we give our social partners the responsibility of concluding their own collective agreements. This is the value of delegating and sharing responsibility. That means that if you do that, you can accommodate issues such as globalisation and the problems involving an ageing population that you have in that society. Only by giving and sharing that responsibility can this be done.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the social debate, which everyone refers to as the social model, I am in favour of it, as long as the social values prevail. I am in favour of a debate in which we, on the basis of those social values, can demonstrate that we are capable of providing answers, because they need to be given. This is where I would beg to differ from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I do not want a liberal market economy, but a socially-oriented market economy in which the social values are used as a basis, in which we find the answers to globalisation together, secure jobs, and ensure that the social security systems will be set up in such a way as to allow people to contribute to prosperity and thus employment.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, although I do not expect any initiatives that will defy the judges’ rights, I do expect some that will have that effect on Parliament and the Council.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that the Swedish Government is offending against the internal market and that he intended to take action against the Swedish Government when the case was dealt with by the Court. He is saying the same thing today. If that is not bringing the Swedish collective agreement model into question, then I do not know what, in fact, is. Mr Watson, who is not in the Chamber, says that the Latvian company paid its employees under the Swedish collective agreement model, but that is untrue. It paid just over half of the amount payable under the Swedish collective agreements in the Stockholm area, namely SEK 78 instead of SEK 140 per hour. Mr McCreevy recommends that there should be 25 different collective agreements: one for each country. That is a race to the bottom, not a race to the top.</p>
<p class="contents">So is the Swedish model less successful than other models? No. If we look at the Lisbon process, we see that it is perhaps the most successful. Is it more protectionist? No, Mr Poettering, Sweden has no transitional rules like Germany’s. On the contrary, it is open to labour from around the EU coming in. Is it discriminatory? The answer is no. All companies are treated equally, irrespective of whether they are Swedish or Latvian. Collective agreements are drawn up on the basis of the existing collective agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">You talked about Spain and Portugal, Mr Barroso. Spain and Portugal have got themselves up to the same levels as other Member States. What is it you are advocating now? Yes, a race to the bottom. You should think carefully. You have launched this debate on the social model by recommending that we have a race to the bottom by having different collective agreements in different countries, that is to say 25 different collective agreements. This will not create a European social model. I therefore advise you to launch the debate in some other way. Otherwise, there will be a war regarding the debate on the social model.</p>

It is therefore odd and quite tragic that, in country after country, the directive is now being used as a weapon in what is basically a debate characterised by protectionism and nationalism. Instead of standing up for the proposal and constructively trying to improve it, ministers in, for example, Sweden have shamelessly exploited people’s anxiety about globalisation and jobs by portraying the Services Directive as a great threat. The words ‘social dumping’ are hissed like an evil incantation, denoting one more wicked stratagem from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">No one wants to see social dumping, but the Services Directive does not lead to social dumping. Nor does it threaten the Swedish model or the Swedish collective agreements. The all but hysterical tone adopted by Social Democratic unions and politicians in Sweden is irresponsible. The Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Östros, has completely lost the plot when he accuses the Commission of intervening against a Member State on behalf of a ‘foreign company’. It cannot have escaped Mr Östros that the foreign company is Latvian, that Latvia is a member of the European Union and that freedom of movement is one of the cornerstones of EU cooperation. How is it that there are no problems when Swedish construction workers travel to Germany and work for higher wages than in Sweden but for lower wages than those earned by German construction workers? That being said, there is an election campaign in Sweden, so that is the way things are.</p>
<p class="contents">Free trade, competition and mobility of services are good for Europe and good for Sweden. Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from obstacles to the knowledge-intensive services being removed. To oppose the Services Directive for reasons to do with election tactics and to threaten to block it in the Council is an historic act of folly.</p>

Not only has he pre-empted a court ruling, but he has also, and above all, put a question mark against the protection of workers as an element in the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the freedom to provide services has always – not least in the Posting of Workers Directive – been seen as compatible with workers’ protection. The freedom to provide services must continue, in future, to include protection for workers if ‘social Europe’ is to be something we actually want to establish rather than a mere form of words. The reason why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stated that the Services Directive, which Commissioner McCreevy defends, is compatible neither with the Treaty nor with the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it calls into question the protection of workers. It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, struck out those very parts of the Services Directive by which the protection of workers was eroded. If Europe is to be competitive, it needs a social dimension. Competitiveness also demands that working conditions be fair and that workers should enjoy equal rights. As Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr McCreevy is bound to pursue a policy of worker protection and not just one that defends one party’s interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does your statement reflect thoughts and ideas that really are discussed behind the Commission’s closed doors? In that case, it is good that we citizens, the Left and the trade union movement have now obtained proof that all the fine talk about social dialogue and the social dimension is just fancy words.

In fact, I am surprised that your words about social models have caused such a stir. Being Irish I have long known – but perhaps others have not – of your opposition to the so-called European social model. You became Finance Minister just as Ireland’s Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EU’s poorest nations to its financial summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite our wealth, when you left office last year, we still had one of the lowest social spends in the EU. You had more money at your disposal than anyone in Irish history, yet the Irish health system remained an under-funded disgrace, with long waiting lists for the simplest operations and patients crammed into hospital hallways every weekend. Special needs children were regularly denied appropriate education and therapy, and you left public housing lists to grow and grow. Your budgets denied rights and services to the most vulnerable in Irish society.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the opposition you express to Sweden’s social model is not news to me. However, here is my question: Mr McCreevy, what is the point of a society that does not serve its people? What is the money we create for? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that only competition which is based on the four fundamental values of the European Union will enable the companies and workers of the new Member States to escape their permanent poverty, and competition will also be the only chance to preserve, to some extent, the high social standards of the so-called ‘rich’ European Union Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was good that he said that, as what he was boasting about had in fact been a defeat for him. He and his party had taken the lead in combating freedom of movement and had wanted to introduce transitional rules. They lost, however.</p>

That is almost nothing, but we have acquired a host of people who have been able to contribute tax income and labour to our country. We should be pleased that you lost, for Europe was the winner.</p>

If I may, I should therefore like to make a few comments from the point of view of a trade union member from a new Member State. I should like to start by using a phrase coined by Mr Chirac, the French President; Commissioner McCreevy missed a good opportunity to keep quiet, and is therefore merely reaping what he sowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Do trade unions have a right to take action if they believe the interests of their members to be at risk? They most certainly do. Much uncertainty surrounds the case as a whole. While on the one hand there has been talk of starvation wages of SEK 35-45 per hour, on the other hand it has been reported that the Swedish minimum wage of SEK 109 per hour was paid. There have been claims that certain articles of the Treaty establishing the European Community have been violated, and criticism has also been levelled at the Swedish labour model. Questions also need to be asked with regard to whether the Swedish labour inspectorate took any action.</p>
<p class="contents">All EU Member States are members of the International Labour Organisation, and have ratified treaties that grant far-reaching powers to trade unions. Workers not only have the right to form trade unions and to negotiate collectively, but also to defend themselves if their jobs are at risk. Sweden is one of only three countries to have allowed citizens of the new Member States to work within its territory almost immediately after the latter joined the European Union, without imposing any transitional measures. The only demand the country makes is that its rules and customs be observed. It is quite absurd to accuse Sweden of attempting to seal off its labour market, and it would be regrettable if the whole incident were interpreted as a Swedish attack on workers from the new Member States. Czech trade union members have also always taken the view that foreigners working in the Czech Republic must receive the same wages and have the same status as Czech citizens, as well as being subject to the attendant obligations. Unfortunately, we have not always managed to stand up in the face of blatant violations of Czech rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever the Commission talks of the need to adopt a directive on services, it assures us that the Posting of Workers Directive, the provisions of which are intended to prevent social dumping, will continue to apply. We should therefore ensure that the Posting of Workers Directive becomes more than just a piece of paper in our Member States. In conclusion, I would note that sit-ins are one of the most effective weapons in the trade unions’ arsenal. I am quite sure that our Swedish counterparts only resorted to this weapon after much thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Employees and employers enter into voluntary agreements on wages and working conditions. The idea is that everyone is welcome to work on agreed conditions. We have also developed a Nordic welfare model with social rights for all citizens, financed by high taxes. It has given us a flexible labour market in which it is easy to fire, and still easier to hire, people. Moreover, we are creating more jobs than we are losing through globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should therefore say: ‘What we have here is a recipe for social protection, giving us the necessary flexibility. That is what we all need. Let us study this remarkable model.’ Instead, the Commission says: ‘Let us deem the Nordic social welfare model and agreement-based model to be unlawful.’ Mr Mc Creevy, I am not saying that you should adopt our model, but the Commission should understand and respect the fact that we have chosen that model, and we are never going to give it up. Moreover, I would ask Mr Barosso to withdraw his support for the Latvian firm in the Vaxholm case.

Nevertheless, I should like to respond more precisely to the questions posed, in particular by Mr Schulz, who cited questions by Mr Rasmussen.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first question, concerning trade unions. Do they have the right to strike? Of course, it is a fundamental right and a fundamental freedom, in accordance with our European principles. We entirely respect the right to strike of all trade unions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question: is the internal market compatible with the Scandinavian social model? There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the third question: if that is the case, what will the Commission’s response be? First and foremost, we need to know what the Court of Justice requires from us. Until I have been consulted by the Court, I am unable to tell you what our position will be, legally speaking. On the other hand, I am able to tell you what our position will not be and what it will be in essence. We will never attack the Scandinavian or Swedish social model, but we will fight tooth and nail for the Treaties, because the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. We must strictly abide by the Treaties. We will therefore be issuing a response that is compatible with the Treaties and with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the core issue, Mr President, Mr McCreevy, is preventing the dichotomy between the internal market and social rights. In the debate, this at times seems to be a contradiction in terms: those who are in favour of the internal market, on the one hand, and those who are in favour of a social Europe, on the other. I will say to you frankly that the role of the Commission is to try to combine these two principles. The key to the growth that we require in order to strengthen our social ambitions is an internal market that is truly active and operational. We are therefore issuing a communication for consultation by this week’s Informal Summit, and I am delighted that it has been positively received by all of the political forces.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing, for example, to create a Globalisation Adjustment Fund by attempting to bring together two elements: an open internal market free from artificial protectionism in our Community, on the one hand, and a stronger social ambition, on the other. In this respect, I should like it if certain parties, which are in favour in this House of a more social Europe, gave their support within their governments to a European budget drawing greater inspiration from these very values. We are not going to resolve the problem currently facing an enlarged Europe through the use of artificial barriers between our countries. Rather, we will do so by harmonising upwards, which means using a more active economic and social cohesion policy that promotes the development of all of the regions of our Union. In fact, there are 25 of us now. We have to carry out a more ambitious policy, aimed at social redistribution at EU level but, in doing so, we must avoid raising artificial barriers between our countries. That is the issue at stake. I can assure you that the European Commission will continue to work along these lines in order to see an internal market put in place, of course, but also in order to see economic and social cohesion occur in a Europe in which we want not only more prosperity, but also more fairness.</p>
