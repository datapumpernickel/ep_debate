<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes this opportunity to emphasise once again how much importance the Community attaches to conservation of the marine environment and the protection of its biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">This importance has already been highlighted by Parliament and by the Council in the Sixth Community Environment Programme. One of the aims of this programme is to ensure that no further biodiversity is lost after 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection and conservation of wild flora and fauna are also two of the objectives defined in the communication from the European Commission on a strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Cetaceans are a sensitive part of marine life. They are certainly at risk from a range of human activity, but it is not always easy to establish a link between such activity and the condition of these animals. The Commission is keeping abreast of the current debate on the possible effects of the use of low frequency active sonar on some species of cetaceans. It may well be that intense tones transmitted at low frequency do disturb these creatures. More detailed research is however called for to establish just how seriously the transmissions affect them. Nonetheless, the current uncertainty as to the effects of these transmissions cannot be used as an excuse to avoid taking steps to deal with the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that extreme caution should be exercised in the use of this technology in view of the possible repercussions for the marine environment. Ideally, the potential repercussions should be assessed in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you that cetaceans are protected under Directive 92/43, the Habitats Directive. One of the obligations it places on Member States is that the latter should take the necessary measures to prevent these species being disturbed.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons and following recent events in the Canary Islands, at the Habitats Committee meeting on 20 November the Commission requested the national authorities of Member States where similar incidents may have taken place to provide further details on the subject. We shall now send the Member States a reminder to ensure they respond to our request. All the information received further to this appeal will be forwarded to the House by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is to ask independent scientific bodies such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to assess the current situation together with available knowledge on the subject. It is hoped that more information on the possible consequences of the use of low frequency active sonar for the marine environment can be obtained. Only when sound scientific information is available will it be possible to decide on the nature of the measures needed to supplement those already in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has to be said right at the start that it is completely justified to try and develop a defence system to monitor submarines that use new technology, which are difficult to see using conventional passive radar. It is obvious that submarines that cannot be detected with radar are only used by those with hostile intentions. We therefore have to keep abreast of developments. This is a question, however, of what sort of technology we choose and what its price is in ecological terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The low frequency active radar system developed by NATO known as LFAS can cause whales to stray onto shores and can damage their internal organs, leading to death. High decibel and low frequency noise produced by radar can carry for thousands of kilometres in the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been whale deaths in the areas where the United States of America has tested the system. In March 2000, 17 whales were beached on the shores of the Bahamas Islands and eight of them died whilst the navy’s radar system was being tested in the sea. Autopsies carried out on the dead whales revealed haematomas in the brain and inner ear cause by extremely loud noise. The US navy itself stated in its report on the whale deaths in the Bahamas that LFAS had been the most likely cause of death.</p>
<p class="contents">In September 2002 in the Canary Islands, and so within the EU area, whale deaths occurred on a scale hardly seen for 20 years, when 15 whales of different species died from haematomas. NATO was conducting military manoeuvres in the area involving 58 warships and six submarines from different member states of the alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The LFAS equipment produces low frequency noise at 1 000 hertz and an average of 250 decibels to comb the seabed from hundreds of kilometres away.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of loud but low frequency noise on the behaviour of whales and their internal organs are wide-ranging. The din can cause permanent damage to the ear bones, and brain and lung haemorrhage. The system can muddle the communication system of whales even a long way off from the sound source as it operates on the same low frequencies that the whales themselves use. The noise makes it difficult for the whales to orient themselves, form herds, mate and find food. The link between radar and whale deaths is actually hard to prove because it is very difficult to track whales and study changes in their behaviour over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The US navy has carried out an evaluation of the effects of the system on the environment, but reputable American environmental organisations regard it as flawed. A federal judge last November prohibited the navy from testing the system in US territorial waters until further notice with reference to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Nevertheless, the navy has a permit from a national authority to test the system for a total of 432 hours in other seawaters until August this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now the navy has agreed to test their equipment a long way off from the coast, and away too from known marine mammal breeding grounds and migratory routes. Researchers have said, however, that testing is not safe even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean because no one can be absolutely certain as to what the whales’ routes will be. The system can be used to cover up to 75% of the world’s seas.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains totally unclear as to what effect the system would have in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, where the radar range is from shore to shore and animals would not be able to escape the noise. The EU clearly has an obligation to act and ask for information on the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic interests are clearly linked to the issue. Fishermen active in the EU have been concerned over the last year of the effects of radar systems on fish stocks in their fishing grounds. Although fish might be less prone than marine mammals to the harmful effects of the system, obviously the noise of the radar could drive them away and thus harm people’s livelihoods.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I want to thank the Commission for its statement. On the basis of all I have said we should try to obtain a ban on the use of this radar system until further notice and swiftly discover its effects on marine life. It would be best if the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would debate the issue and draft a report on it, on the basis of the Commission’s statement we have heard here today and any other data obtained from elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As my colleague Mrs Korhola has said, there is more and more evidence that suggests that these highly intensive active sonars pose a very major threat to marine mammals and to fish. The frightening fact is that this technology exposes them to noise pollution at levels 200 billion times greater than that which we know already disturbs them, and so it is not really surprising that we are already seeing deaths from lung haemorrhages, from hearing loss and disruption of feeding, breeding and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">But this technology also constitutes a breach of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention which requires states to take all measures that are necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the marine environment from any source. The time has come, accordingly, for NATO and its members to act, and since European Union Member States make up over half of the 19 members of NATO, the EU has a special responsibility to promote action. For the Commission to respond to a written question of mine on 29 November 2002 simply by saying this type of technology needs to be used with caution is not good enough. The fact is that this type of technology cannot be used with caution when you consider that, at a hundred miles from the ship which is the source of the noise, this noise can still cause a tearing of the tissues in the air sac, for example, behind whales' and dolphins' brains. That is why we want to see an immediate moratorium on any deployment of LFAS by navies of any NATO country and we want a comprehensive and independent impact assessment to take place. We also want the US and NATO countries to prepare and make public the studies on the potentially adverse effects of LFAS which are required by law under Article 206 of the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We had hoped too that the Council might have been prepared to make a statement on LFAS here this afternoon as well and I am disappointed that it is not here, but there is a clear role for the Commission as well and I have two specific questions for it: will it agree to conduct a study on the impact of LFAS on the marine environment, and will it ensure that the subject is raised in the transatlantic dialogue?</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward very much to your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
