It was only the degree to which all the institutions were committed to working together that made it possible for the new financial regulation to be adopted unanimously by the Council on 25 June 2002. The new financial regulation forms a fundamental part of the reform of the Commission, and I am proud of our having achieved this feat of strength in 2002. I would like to re-emphasise my most especial thanks to Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell'Alba, the latter of whom is not here, but I would like to take this opportunity to mention him again.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our main concerns in the recasting of the financial regulation was that it should be simplified by incorporating the very detailed provisions in the rules for implementation, which are to be adopted even before the end of the year in order that they may enter into force on 1 January 2003, that is, at the same time as the new financial regulation. Together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr van Hulten has done very thorough work, for which I thank you most warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Commission, I have the following to say concerning the individual amendments. Firstly, many of the report's amendments are aimed at incorporating all the reports and items of information to be transmitted to the budgetary authority in an annex summarising the annual activity reports of the authorising officers whose offices administer resources. The Commission favours such a tightening-up of the procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is proposed in the report, with reference to the summary of the annual activity reports of the authorising authorities, that the requirement that such a summary should be submitted to the discharge authority should apply not only to the Commission, but also to the other institutions. The aim underlying this is one that I share, but the wording of the financial regulation does not permit us to impose such an obligation on other institutions, which in our view would have to agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, amendments are proposed in the report relating to the financial actors named in the financial regulation, and these amendments have two aims in view: a) that the budgetary authority be informed when the authorising authorities – at A1 level – and the accounting officer change, and b) that the posts of accounting officer and internal auditor be advertised externally. It therefore follows that the budgetary authority will be informed of new appointments. We are unable, however, to go along with the report's proposal, and, moreover, immediate external advertising would be contrary to the Statute, which expressly provides for posts to be, in the first instance, trawled within the institutions, before they can be advertised externally. This means that immediate external advertising would not be compatible with the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards the amendments on the panel on financial irregularities, we can agree to the proposal that one of the panel's members should be an independent expert. However, we see the mandatory investigation of irregularities even in unimportant cases as going too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as regards the directive on late payment, I note Parliament's reminder that the deadline for implementation has expired and that the institutions must, or at any rate should, abide by the rules on interest rates and deadlines applicable to late payment.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I am, in addition, able to agree to several amendments on accounting practice. In particular, the Commission agrees to the clarification regarding the introduction of an integrated data processing system, which is entirely in line with its own earlier proposals. As regards the demand for the drawing up of a list of all persons with the right of access to the electronic accounting system and the creation of an audit trail clearly showing what changes have been made to the system and by whom, I am able to inform you that the Commission is already in possession of both of these. We welcome the incorporation of this provision into the rules for implementation, although I am at the moment unable to give you any information as to whether these conditions are already being complied with by the accounting systems of institutions other than the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point is that, in Amendment No 17, you demand that the budgetary authority should be informed of all waivers of recovery of debt in excess of EUR 100 000. The Commission will take this on board as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with another clarification relating to the final amendment in the report. This reads: 'The accounts for the 2002 financial year shall be drawn up and presented in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 1977, except for the obligation to submit these to the Financial Controller.' I will point out now that it was made clear in the new financial regulation that there will be a transitional period up to the 2005 financial year for the clearance of accounts, meaning that, until 2005, the clearance of accounts shall follow the procedure laid down in the financial regulation as at present valid. In view of the fact that the only Member States so far to have largely gone over to accrual accounting – a system of accounting of a rather more Anglo-American stamp – is Great Britain, where it took over seven years to introduce it, the timetable for the Commission continues to be ambitious in the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat my offer to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control as soon as possible concerning the proposals that the Commission has made here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Hulten (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, if this debate was scheduled at this time because of the Conference of Presidents' suspected interest in the subject matter, they were probably right. It is not a very exciting topic to be discussing but, as we all know, it is very important or we would not be here. I have to say it is a shame that two of the three committee members who voted against the report in committee and, therefore, triggered a debate in plenary, are not here today to explain their objections to the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the committee members who supported me in drawing up this report and giving it near unanimous backing in committee. Thanks are due also to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have again had on this report. Many of the amendments contained in the committee's report are technical in nature. I am not going to go into that. I just want to mention a few substantive issues the Commissioner also raised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with a number of points where we feel the implementing rules could be strengthened. The first concerns weaknesses regarding the appointment and functioning of senior financial actors, something which has been an issue for the last few months. There have been several instances of transfers or terminations of duties involving directors-general and there has been the case of the accounting officer, Mrs Andreasson. The issues raised are being dealt with by the committee and assessed on their own merits. However, issues of form have also arisen concerning how such appointments, transfers and terminations are dealt with within the Commission. We would like to see certain safeguards built into the Financial Regulation. Safeguards, not in the sense that you can be sure mistakes will never be made or problems will never occur, but safeguards that introduce more transparency to ensure that the process is visible and that we are not faced with surprises and <span class="italic">faits accomplis.</span></p>
<p class="contents">This involves the appointment of senior officers, something to which you referred, Commissioner. I will request that a report be submitted to the budgetary authority and that the accounting officer and internal auditor be appointed on the basis of a vacancy notice in the Official Journal. They should be external candidates, where necessary on limited-term contracts. I realise that we cannot change the Financial Regulation but we must take the matter up in the Staff Regulations, because it is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of the financial irregularities panel, which is designed to fill a gap in the existing set-up and introduce new expertise. What we want to avoid is a system where peers are assessing peers. The introduction of an independent external element is, therefore, important, and I welcome the fact that you have accepted that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the matter of improving the quality and integrity of the computerised accounting system, something you also mentioned. We want a single integrated computer system, with access restricted to a list of authorised persons to be kept by the institution. I realise that the Commission is already doing this, and it is important the other institutions should be required to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want to see an easy-to-read audit trail maintained, to ensure adequate control of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I want to mention is late payments and the need to bring commercial payments in line with the relevant directive. I am sure my colleague, Mr Casaca, who has worked hard on this, will have something more to say. Three amendments have been tabled in plenary in addition to the ones from the committee. One by the PPE-DE Group and two by the GUE/NGL Group, none of which I support. The PPE-DE is retabling an amendment that was rejected in committee, proposing to create a fully independent accounting officer with no lines of accountability and responsibility within the Commission. I cannot support that because it contradicts the Financial Regulation itself, in relation to which these are implementing rules. Nor is there any point in creating an isolated island within the institution, which would go against the whole principle of accountability. Great formal power does not necessarily mean better decision-making, as we know.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group, I can agree in spirit with Amendment No 34 on the need for the accounting officer to have full information, but in practice it would lead to a huge bureaucracy, with 600 000 payments going through one single person. Although not the aim of the amendment, it would certainly lead to unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment concerns the proposal on the criteria to be taken into account in the event of a waiver of recovery of an established debt. There are two criteria: one on competition and one on economic and social damage caused by a debt if it is recovered. The GUE/NGL Group wants to scrap this possibility for authorising officers. The amendment we have introduced and which you have just accepted, introducing a reporting requirement to Parliament, offers sufficient safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think these amendments strengthen the proposal and I call on the Commission to incorporate them all into the final text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would a regulation such as the EU's Financial Regulation be without rules for its implementation? Obviously, it would be worthless or impracticable and incapable of being implemented, for, in the aftermath of our sustained work, in committee and in plenary, on a recasting of the Financial Regulation, here, hot on its heels, comes the regulation on the rules for implementation. Why do I lay such emphasis on this? I do so because I think we are giving another example of how legislation is evidently insufficient, but needs further elaboration. That does not help European law to be clear, simple or comprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, though, this wide-ranging creativity in legal matters does indeed contribute towards legal veracity, by which I mean the application of laws currently in force. It is with reference to this that I ask the Commissioner responsible for these matters to act in accordance with the law and not follow the example of the President of the present Commission, who simply describes current laws – such as the Stability Pact – as stupid and fails to apply them.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the degree to which public has confidence in this Europe of ours is largely dependent on the Financial Regulation and on the rules for its implementation means that these are not in any way suited to being played about with in this way. Such confidence is damaged by the Commission's thoughtless and arrogant way of acting or failing to act; among other things, it has obviously neglected to ensure that its accounting system is reliable and proof against manipulation. This is a dereliction of duty dating back to the day it took office, despite repeated admonitions from, inter alia, the European Court of Auditors, and one for which it must be held accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also precisely why it is so important that the so-called accounting officer should be in a clearly defined and independent position. The Commission having, unfortunately, been so irresponsible as to abolish the independent financial controller, the accounting officer will acquire even greater importance. He must be able to get his hands on additional information with absolute independence, suspend payments, and criticise people in prominent positions, without being removed from office and subjected to disciplinary proceedings or something of that sort.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to support my group's Amendment No 33, and also the other two amendments tabled by Mr Blak, which are also intended to enhance the clarity and transparency of the law. We must not allow large margins of appreciation in budgetary law. Mr van Hulten, I am not surprised at your lack of support for Amendment No 33. The arguments you adduce here are the same as in committee, but their constant repetition does not render them any more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, in these matters, avoid the least suspicion of decisions being arbitrary or partisan, for only in this way can the Commission disabuse people of their impression that a more lenient standard is applied to the handling of European funds than applies to the handling of national funds. Incidentally, I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has needlessly allowed itself to be put under pressure of time in dealing with these rules. I do not know why we have not waited for the European Court of Auditors to give its opinion, but perhaps the rapporteur, in his great wisdom, will be able to give me an answer on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The use of the financial resources available to the European Union is probably the most complex but equally the most attractive duty that falls to the Community institutions. The structure of the budgetary authority as defined in the Treaties, and the still inadequate role in budgetary policy allotted to Parliament require and justify particular attention to the control and monitoring of budgetary implementation. The truth is that the monitoring of budgetary implementation can only be effective and useful if it is underpinned by principles of transparency and clarity and is supported by rules that are at once ambitious and simple. This is clearly the aim of the new financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, which will enter into force on 1 January 2003, and, specifically, the aim of the new implementing rules proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording used by Mr van Hulten for these rules, without undermining the essence of the Commission proposal, enriches the control and monitoring procedure to an extraordinary degree, making it more comprehensible and straightforward, in other words, it significantly steps up control of the efficiency of Community expenditure. The current budgetary framework is acknowledged to be a precarious one, which does not respond fully to the Union’s political priorities. Consequently, and in the absence of a revision of the financial perspective that could increase the volume of resources available to the European Union, it is becoming mandatory for the European Parliament to make full use of all its competences and prerogatives. The European Parliament will only make full use of these prerogatives and competences if it is able to intervene politically within an administrative framework that is sufficiently dynamic and stabilising but, above all, comprehensible and effective. The principles of unity and universality enshrined in the rules contained in the new regulation – albeit in embryonic form – and which the rapporteur strengthens, as well as the status conferred on internal hearings at the initiative of the rapporteur for each institution are, in my opinion, extremely important and significant steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr van Hulten whom I welcome and congratulate personally, therefore deserves the support of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My sincerest thanks go to him accordingly. The reform of the Financial Regulation began with the report in 1999 by the external committee of experts commonly known as the Five Wise Men. The report mentioned the importance of both simplifying financial administration and clarifying personal accountability. Parliament and the Council approved the new Financial Regulation last spring and it comes into force from the beginning of next year. The reform is partly linked to the Commission’s administrative reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules for implementation now being discussed are connected with this new Financial Regulation. The reform would mean an end to the old ex ante control with responsibility moving away from financial administration to be borne entirely by the authorising officer. This change will mean an increase in their power and responsibility. Because authorising officers are the officials with the most important executive role they must be fully accountable for their actions, and cannot take refuge behind the backs of others. With accountability hopefully becoming clearer, we can also increase efficiency, as at present, for example, delays in making payments in the Commission are too long and do not in any way match the sort of efficiency we see in the world of business.</p>
<p class="contents">The system now to be decided on must not be spoilt by new amendments. For that reason, Amendments Nos 33 and 34, for example, are not acceptable, as they would allow for responsibility for execution to be shared once again by two people, the authorising officer and the accounting officer. The system has to be clear and transparent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore crucial that its provisions for implementation are as clear as possible. The new Financial Regulation should not only lead to efficient handling but also better supervision than was previously the case.</p>
<p class="contents">When supervision and operation are handed over to the various directorates-general, they must be monitored effectively. It is therefore vital that the accounting officer has a strong and independent position. We have proposed an amendment in this vein. The accounting officer must be able to demand and receive more information, stop payments in cases of doubt and report directly to the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we would also like to express our regret that Parliament has not taken this opportunity to investigate the confusion in this area which has existed for years. This should have been carried out by summoning Mrs Andreasen to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Control. The fact is that we have still not received full answers on the approval of the Commission’s accounts for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group has also proposed an amendment limiting the Commission’s ability to write off and write down liabilities. There must be clear grounds for writing off liabilities so that we do not see more cases like the Flechard case, where the person responsible for a serious error is not forced to accept the full consequences of their action. This explains our second amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will simply have to wait and see.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can, unfortunately, see at the present time is that the new era is being ushered in by the weakening of Parliament's rights. The new Financial Regulation's rules of implementation, should, according to previous rules, have been decided on in agreement with Parliament. In law, the Commission is no longer obliged even to listen to Parliament. Of course, Mrs Schreyer, we welcome the way that you are doing that any way, as these rules of implementation do not apply to the Commission alone, but are in future to be applicable to all the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me pick out a number of points on which we should be asking the Commission to think again, if not to make improvements. Take the accounting officer: according to this proposal, the institutions have to select their accounting officers from the ranks of the civil service. Applications from outside will not be possible. This means that we are in fact spoiling our opportunities for even considering external candidates. You have told us, Mrs Schreyer, that the Statute prevents this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the accounting officer's functional independence, on which depends the reliability and credibility of the figures we have to present to the public in their capacity as contributors to the European Union. The draft has nothing to say about this. Why do you not give the accounting officer a right of appeal against attempts at interference in his work, as you have to the internal auditor?</p>
<p class="contents">There are other aspects that cause me concern; one example is the so-called panel on financial irregularities. I hope that is not meant to compete with OLAF or even interfere with its work.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflicts of interest are given a comprehensive and appropriate definition in the Financial Regulation, but the rules of implementation make it look as if this can be simply evaded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Article 84's provisions on the waiver or claims open the door to waiving the recovery of debts. It will be the European taxpayer who will have to cough up for these decisions, by paying additional contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, for the speed with which he has worked under enormous pressure of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is my belief, Commissioner, that such would be a false assessment and would lead us into renewed disaster. It was far more a matter of culture. If, on the one hand, you are saying that the amendment of the Financial Regulation and the rules associated with it is one of the most ambitious tasks involved in the reform of the Commission, then I have to say that you cannot be aiming very high! You tell us that the reason we cannot have external candidates for the post of accounting officer is that there is a Statute that says so. I ask you! If the Commission cannot even alter a Statute, how does it think it is going to govern the EU? Surely one of the first things that the executive should be able to do is to change the rules governing its own staff! That, Commissioner, is just not acceptable! Perhaps you are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p class="contents">In my judgment, this is about changing the culture. That was possible under the old rules, and will also be possible under the new ones. When, for example, I study reports, as I have done in connection with the whole Eurostat business, in which you looked on and you continued to spend European taxpayers' money on employing firms that, to your own knowledge have demonstrably deceived and cheated you, I do not know, Commissioner, whether this renewed culture, under the banner of zero tolerance, the idea with which we started out in 1999, has actually gained a foothold yet! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me first put something straight. The Court of Auditors may have had many criticisms to make of various accounting rules and of the system itself, but it always used to confirm that the completed accounts were a true and faithful record of income and expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning, secondly, to the question of the accounting officer's role, I am also grateful for the clarifications that have been given today. The accounting officer carries out the orders of the authorising authority, and the accuracy of the accounting system is his responsibility, but he is not the financial controller. On the contrary, it is important that financial management and accounting should be kept as separate tasks, and that the bookkeeper should not be involved in the management of funds' resources. That is not his job, nor should it be; on the contrary, it is for him to keep the books properly. This separation of the functions is important.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the external advertisement of posts is concerned, the Statute – which, as you will be aware, is laid down by the Council – governs the sequence of events involved in recruitment. It does not prevent posts being externally advertised. It is the stages that we are dealing with here. I must, though, reiterate that the Financial Regulation stipulates that the accounting officer shall be an official of the Commission. Why is that the case? It is of course because this person opens accounts for the European institutions, which means that he or she is in a position of trust. That being so, one cannot but wonder whether the concealment of important facts in a job application could justify this position of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been urged that the rules on accounting procedures should be clear. In the past, of course, we had very clear and simple rules, in that the entire public accounting system was based on what, in Germany, we term cameralistic accounting, in which the cash spent and the cash books – the actual outgoings and the actual receipts – are compared with what is in the budget. That is, of course, also the way in which the Commission and other offices administering public expenditure are accountable to the body which legislates on the budget. They want us to tell them how much of any given budget line they have voted has actually been spent on it. This accounting system will of course continue to play a part in the future, but this information is now no longer adequate for the purposes of management. For that, we need more information in the accounting system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore proposed, and the legislature has so decided, that we should go further along this Anglo-American road towards a system of accrual accounting, containing more rules and information specific to management functions. We will, however, have another opportunity to discuss these issues. Let me repeat that I would be more than happy to talk about these issues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, but, at this late hour, I will just thank Mr van Hulten again for the report and congratulate him on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
