<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Charter of EU Fundamental Rights and a tightening up of aliens policy in various Member States of the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">Governments throughout the EU are tightening up their aliens policy and creating more and more obstacles to asylum-seekers, for example: tightening up family reunification provisions, with those concerned being required to deposit large amounts of money as a guarantee, an increase in the minimum age for marriage to 24, expulsion of children born to parents who entered the country illegally, the obligation on immigrants to prove that they have a job to go to, and restrictions on the right of immigrants’ parents to come and live with their children. The measures referred to above constitute a downright violation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures referred to above and implemented by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit of, inter alia, Articles 7, 9, 15(3), 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 33, 34, 41 and 47 of the said Charter, and it is prepared, where appropriate, to intervene? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Seville European Council decided to reinforce the EU’s efforts in this field. There was agreement that the measures taken in the short or long term for the joint management of migration flows must strike a fair balance. On the one hand, there should be an integration policy for lawfully resident immigrants and an asylum policy complying with the international conventions, principally the 1951 Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, our policy must involve resolute action to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. That is what is stated in paragraph 28 of the conclusions agreed in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures to which the honourable Member refers are legislation adopted by the individual Member States as national measures for combating the problems faced. It is outside the Council’s competence to decide whether the measures taken by the Member States are, or are not, in accordance with the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to Article 51(1) of the Charter, affirming that the Member States are bound by the Charter when they are implementing Union law and only when they are implementing Union law. There is generally no question of the regulations to which the honourable Member refers being adopted in implementation of Union law, and I do not therefore think that there is any point in asking me to assess whether the measures taken by the Member States are in accordance with the Charter. The Charter is of a different character. It is aimed at the implementation of Union law. Wearing my other hat as Danish Minister for Integration, I should like to say, however, that, when it comes to Danish legislation in this field, it complies fully with all the international standards. That is something I should like to emphasise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I clearly asked whether the Council could indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures enacted by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit, I repeat the spirit, of the Charter. I am aware of the fact that the Charter is a solemn declaration, Mr Haarder, but it contains very fine passages about respecting privacy, the right to marry and start a family, the right to equal working conditions, the right to asylum, the ban on discrimination, and I could carry on for a few minutes yet. Surely you have to admit, Mr Haarder, that in your country too, legislation is now being enacted which is at least in breach of the spirit of what is written in the Charter. I should like to call on the Council, the Ministers of the Fifteen Member States, to respect the spirit of the Charter.

<p class="contents">I should also like to add that what the question says is false in certain respects. It states, for example, that a country has a minimum age for marriage, and that is incorrect. There are conditions governing the circumstances under which a permanent residence permit can be obtained solely on the grounds of marriage, and that is something quite different. It is self-evident that no condition of this kind applies, of course, to refugees for, if it did, it would be contrary to the conventions. I can assure Mr Staes, when he talks about Danish legislation, that we are up to speed on the conventions. We are well aware of how they are to be interpreted, and I could not contemplate taking responsibility for any breach at all, either of the spirit or of the letter, of any convention whatsoever. I was myself the European Parliament’s human rights spokesman in 1998 and 1999. The reports are there to be found and read. I have no intention of infringing either the spirit or the letter of any international convention whatsoever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is due to reduced 2001 cereal harvests caused by adverse weather and reduced planting.

The Council expressed its concern about the situation in southern Africa where up to 13 million people are feared to have been hit by the crisis. The Council is disturbed by various political decisions and initiatives that have been taken and that have apparently contributed to exacerbating an already alarming humanitarian situation, involving drought and floods. The Council is of the view that solving the humanitarian crisis is one of the most important political priorities, and it therefore calls upon the countries in the area to direct their respective policies towards fulfilling that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional efforts to solve the crisis should be encouraged in line with principles, such as that of good governance, laid down in the initiative concerning the New Partnership for African Development, NEPAD, in which the states of southern Africa play a crucial role.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council calls upon the countries in the region to do their utmost to facilitate the regional and humanitarian operations that are under way, including those designed to provide logistical and administrative support and to secure access to, and the distribution of, emergency aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations forming part of civil society ought to play a decisive role in the distribution of food aid so as to prevent such aid being misused for political ends. The EU has already responded by providing extensive food and humanitarian aid to the area. There is, however, a need for further efforts. The EU and its Member States are prepared, in close cooperation with the SADC countries, to continue to contribute to these efforts.</p>

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is now warning that some 13 million people are threatened with starvation over the next six months as a result of food shortages brought about by adverse weather conditions and flawed government planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa is to visit six drought-stricken countries in the region from 6 to 16 September, and I understand that representatives of WHO, the UN Children's Fund and the Food and Agricultural Organisation are expected to join the mission. What strikes me is that there is no reference to EU participation. Would the Council take appropriate and urgent action to ensure that the EU is involved in this mission and in the coordination of international food aid with other international organisations?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to know what the Council's response is to the FAO warning in a report last August that only 24% of the USD 507 million needed to provide food assistance until the next harvest in April 2003 has been pledged and that agricultural inputs are needed to help farmers recover from the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In accordance with this resolution, the open coordination method is to be applied in a flexible and appropriate way to certain priority themes in the youth field. The Commission has drawn up proposals on this in a white paper entitled ‘A New Impetus for European Youth’. It was published in November of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and participation are some of the subjects which will be tackled initially. In consultation with the Member States, the Commission has drawn up a questionnaire on these subjects. The questionnaire has now been submitted to the Member States, which should answer the questionnaire with due regard for prevailing opinion among young people themselves, youth organisations and other relevant bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues concerning young people’s voluntary work and greater understanding and knowledge of young people will be tackled at a later date. I would like to emphasise on the Council’s behalf that the new framework for European cooperation in the youth field is still at a preliminary stage.

The reason for Mr Hyland asking this question, and why I am taking it on his behalf, is that over the last few years we have seen more and more young people becoming disconnected from political and civil life. Indeed those same people who feel no connection with the political movements or the political parties in their own countries are very likely to turn up at demonstrations about anti-globalisation, about reclaiming the streets or eradication of poverty and so on. Surely, through the Council and the good offices of the minister himself, there must be some mechanism whereby that energy and that idealism can be harnessed for the good of all of society and not just for the good of the few. I am particularly anxious to hear an answer concerning the initiatives they hope to undertake during the Danish presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we have a group of young people who are more internationally minded than ever before and who are deeply committed. We saw this in the summer at the ‘Youth 2000’ forum, where a thousand young people from throughout Europe met at 13 folk high schools in Denmark, where they each drew up proposals for a constitution for Europe and finally came together and combined them all into a single proposal which they presented to the Convention. I also want to mention the youth convention as exemplifying these very committed young people. Next, there is a very large group which is extremely passive. They are perhaps not opposed to European cooperation, but it does not interest them. Finally, there is a very small group which demonstrates and throws stones. As for this small group, I would say that one of the gratifying features of the meeting in Elsinore at the weekend was that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators present. That is a step forward – let us hope that this will characterise the rest of the presidency and also future presidencies. I can only declare myself in agreement with the honourable Member. The Council is very aware of this issue, and I think this has been stated so well that I do not need to repeat it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when the Union’s activities are characterised by increasing development and differentiation, and immediately before major enlargement to include a number of new Member States, the European Council has found it necessary to strengthen the Council’s powers as a provider of guidelines and impetus. This is precisely what the role of the European Council is according to the Treaty. The Council cannot see that these practical guidelines are in any way incompatible with the Commission’s executive powers, which cannot in any way be affected by a decision, the sole purpose of which is to enable the European Council to exercise as effectively as possible the responsibility which the European Council has been given. In this respect, I would point out that the President of the Commission is of course a member of the European Council, and I have not heard any objections to the Council’s trying to reform itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards any possible democratic deficit and the lack of separation of powers within the Union, the Council considers that the current situation, regardless of what one thinks about it, cannot be affected by a reform the sole purpose of which is, as has already been observed, to implement the existing provisions of the Treaty more effectively. As the question concerning the separation of the executive and legislative powers – whether it is a matter of the principle in general or its application in the Union – has not been discussed as such by the Council, the Council is not in a position to respond to the exact point raised in Question H-O 535. Of course, the Council is not unaware of this classic problem, which is indirectly taken up in the Laeken declaration, for example, adopted by the European Council in December, and which will, in all probability, also be taken up in the Convention and later at the subsequent intergovernmental conference. The honourable Member must understand that, beyond purely academic considerations which do not belong here, the Council cannot comment on the possible outcome of a debate which will not be conducted in the Council itself and which, in any case, has not yet taken place. I hope that, with this explanation, I have made it clear why I cannot go further into the question which has been raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a matter of form, I would like to report what I said on behalf of the Danish Government in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, that is that the Danish Government is an ardent adherent of the Community method and does not want the Council to take powers from the Commission.

<p class="contents">In June 2002 the deadline that had been set for a political solution to the Cyprus problem, to be achieved by means of talks between the two Cyprus communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN, expired without producing a result, because of Turkish intransigence.</p>

The Council is well aware that no breakthrough has yet been made in the talks, and that disappointingly little progress has so far been made, which has also been stated by the UN Security Council according to the report which Mr de Soto, the UN Special Envoy for Cyprus, issued on 9 July. As the talks are now continuing, the Council expects the parties to increase their efforts with a view to taking advantage of the current unique opportunity and finally make the necessary progress towards a solution – hopefully before the accession negotiations are concluded. The decisions concerning the accession of the candidate countries must be taken before the end of the year within the normal enlargement procedure on the basis of the Commission’s report and the recommendations which the Commission will put forward in its document on the enlargement strategy, which we expect by October.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the accession of Cyprus, the EU’s view, which was put forward once again in Seville, is in line with the Helsinki conclusions, to the effect that a solution of the Cyprus problem will facilitate Cyprus’s accession to the EU. A solution is not, however, a prerequisite for Cyprus’s accession. When it takes its decision, the Council will take into account all the relevant factors. That is a position which it is wise to adhere to, and so we all hope, and cross our fingers, that advantage will be taken of this ‘window of opportunity’, this unique opportunity which there will be this autumn to resolve this extremely old and tragic problem on this wonderful island. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to reports in the Greek press, hundreds of Greek residents of the town of Himara, in southern Albania, have protested formally to the Albanian Government concerning the non-restitution of their property in the part of the town located by the sea, which Albania’s former communist regime took from them. The residents of Himara have not yet managed to obtain the title deeds to their property, and much of it has been illegally transferred to Albanians by the authorities, who took advantage of the absence of the owners outside Albania for a period of many years. There is also a similar problem with the property of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania, whose land was also confiscated by the communist regime and has not since been returned.</p>

It has also emerged that the Autocephalous Orthodox Church makes similar claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to Article 181 of the Albanian constitution, the Albanian Parliament must adopt laws before the end of November with a view to finding a fair solution to questions concerning expropriations and confiscations that took place before the constitution was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian Parliament has set up a special committee on the restoration of property. This committee is now starting to scrutinise the legislation with a view to restoration of, or compensation for, property which was seized under Communist rule. The committee has not completed its work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is fully aware that a solution to the property question is also an essential prerequisite for encouraging domestic and foreign investments in Albania, just as it is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was able to subscribe fully to the assessment of the individual countries, given by the Commission in its first annual report on the stabilisation and association process. On 13 May of this year, the Council approved the recommendations in this report and requested that rapid progress should be made in each of these areas over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">In one of these recommendations, Albania was specifically called on to adopt new legislation on ownership and restoration of property, to remedy the existing shortcomings in the legislation in this field and to ensure better enforcement of property law in Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania is the EU's partner in the stabilisation and association process. The EU maintains a regular dialogue with Albania, especially in the form of the meetings in the advisory EU-Albania taskforce. Here, the EU has the opportunity to stress the importance which is attached to solving this issue, now that the country is starting to approach integration into Europe, at the same time as acquiring closer ties with the EU. It also gives the EU the chance to ensure that Albania continues with the measures which it has promised in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would expect him to decide how the problem should be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The State Department wrote to the Albanian government a few days ago, calling quite specifically for Greek schools to be opened at once, for recognition of land ownership by members of the Greek community and for trespassing on Greek property in Himara to stop. As far as I know, the Greek government has taken similar steps. I would remind the President-in-Office that Greece sends generous financial aid to Albania and that over 600 000 Albanian immigrants work legally and without obstruction in Greece, earning wages that workers in Albania can only dream of.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the European Union which also sends various forms of aid to Albania should take more persuasive measures? And surely it considers it urgent and imperative, Minister, to put a stop to the plan to move 15 000 settlers from northern Albania and Kosovo to the Himara area, in order to tip the ethnic balance against the Greek minority? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Free movement of persons in the Schengen zone</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 22 June a group of 500 Portuguese citizens travelling to Spain to take part in an authorised demonstration to be held in Seville during the European Council meeting was prevented – in a violent manner – from entering Spanish territory by members of the Spanish police forces. Nothing can justify this kind of behaviour and action, totally unacceptable in a Union which considers respect for fundamental freedoms and rights as one of its founding principles. It seems unlikely that the Portuguese citizens represented a particular danger, or indeed any danger, to the Spanish State. And, even if they had, the forceful and heavy-handed behaviour which, unfortunately, characterised the reaction of the Spanish police authorities, would have been quite unacceptable.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards the first question, I would like to draw attention to the fact that neither Article 33 of the EU Treaty nor Article 64(1) of the EC Treaty gives the Council the ability to intervene to maintain public order or security in the Member States. This also applies to public-order measures which the Member States take when meetings of the European Council are held within their territory. This is therefore something in which the Community cannot interfere.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second question, I would like to refer to the Executive Committee Decision of 20 December 1995 on the procedure for applying Article 2(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has a long reference number which I do not want to read out.</p>
<p class="contents">This Decision draws up detailed rules for when controls can be reintroduced at the internal borders. It constitutes a part of the so-called Schengen rules, and it is thus binding for all Schengen States. Incidentally, it is published in OJ L 239 of 22 September 2000, page 133. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, Regulation No 1250 from 1999 lays down that the Structural Funds shall contribute to removing inequalities between men and women and to promoting equal opportunities in the context of strengthening economic and social cohesion. That also applies to pre-accession programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, the Union has set aside considerable financial aid for measures to develop the rural districts by means of the so-called SAPARD programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member of the European Parliament may apply directly to the Commission if she wishes to have a fuller overview of the specific programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">With particular regard to the pre-accession negotiations concerning the chapter on agriculture, the common position of the Union also contains a comprehensive section on development of the rural districts. It covers the aid which will be given through the EU’s various financial instruments. As the rural districts in the candidate countries require restructuring, modernisation and alternative production and facilities, the EU attaches great importance to the measures for developing the rural districts, which have a direct effect on the conditions under which women in these regions work.</p>
<p class="contents">During the negotiations on the chapter on employment and industrial relations policy, the Union has stressed the importance which this section has for the equal treatment of men and women, and it has also been emphasised how necessary it is for the candidate countries to comply with the rules in this field. I would like to draw attention to Regulation No 1257 from 1999, which groups together all Community actions in favour of development of the rural districts and in which it is expressly stated that measures aimed at removing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities for men and women should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the Council concerning agriculture, that is to say the Agricultural Ministers Council, at its meeting on 27 May of this year, adopted specific conclusions on the integration of the equality aspect into the Common Agricultural Policy. The Council expressly recognised in these conclusions that women play a bigger and bigger role in the rural districts, and it calls on the Commission to use the Structural Funds to continue to promote entrepreneurial spirit, high-quality employment, training and the provision of life-long services for rural women.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council urges the Member States to adopt policies which actively strengthen women’s economic capacity in the rural districts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council points out that all the candidate countries have now agreed to come into line with existing Community law regarding equality immediately on accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency wants to follow the same line, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and the further negotiations on accession. We want to make use of every opportunity to draw attention to the general fundamental principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and in this respect to promote equality between men and women, as referred to in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should point out that the current Chairman of this Agricultural Ministers Council is herself from a farming background. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking in particular of the action plan for finding ways of simplifying and improving the quality of the regulatory environment. It invited the three institutions concerned, that is, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to arrange for this to happen on the basis of the work of the High Level Technical Group and to adopt an interinstitutional agreement before the end of 2002 in order to improve the quality of Community legislation and the conditions, including time frames, for its transposition into national law. The High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation met on 15 July 2002. In anticipation of this meeting, the Presidency had put forward a proposed timetable for drawing up and adopting the commercial interinstitutional agreement, starting with the specific actions relating to the three institutions as proposed in the Commission’s action plan. At the meeting on 15 July 2002, it was decided firstly to reach common agreement on the chief elements of a future interinstitutional agreement. The institutions would then, on the basis of this, discuss the practical content of the specific actions of the agreement. At the same time, it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention. Practical measures with a view to an impact assessment of amendments to the Commission’s proposal can be expected to be an element for inclusion in further discussions on an interinstitutional agreement. In this context, I can tell you that the next meeting of the High Level Technical Group is expected to take place next week, on 10 September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the years when I had something to do with this in an academic capacity, it was notorious that it was extremely difficult within the sociology of law to find reliable ways of assessing the impact of legislation which was in force. Predicting the impact of legislation which is going to come into force is yet more difficult. Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it would be wise for the Council to look into issues of methodology before we embark on expensive projects of this kind? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to strike a fair balance between this aim on the one hand and the aim of better integration of those immigrants who are lawfully present in our countries on the other, and of course we also need an asylum policy which complies with international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be mentioned that, even before the Seville European Council, the Spanish Presidency had given a significant impetus to this matter, notably by adopting two normative instruments, which not only map out some of the necessary measures, but also set the framework for future efforts and the development thereof. The instruments concerned are the action plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and the action plan for the management of EU external borders, which were both adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. In addition, this Council reached an agreement on 13 June of this year on conclusions about measures to be taken to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings by sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions from Seville, which make specific reference to these action plans, attach importance to the following measures. Firstly, speeding up the conclusion of readmission agreements currently being negotiated and approval of new briefs for the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries already identified by the Council: see conclusion No 30. Secondly, as regards expulsion and repatriation policies, adoption by the end of the year at the latest of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Green Paper submitted by the Commission in April 2002. This also falls under conclusion No 30.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the gradual introduction of coordinated, integrated management of external borders, which should, among other aims, help bring greater control of migration flows. A number of measures are mapped out which should make it possible to achieve this goal very shortly: see conclusions Nos 31 and 32. In a wider and more general perspective, the conclusions from Seville affirmed that immigration policy, as an essential element to be taken into consideration, should be integrated into the EU’s relations with third countries. They pointed out that an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration must remain the EU’s constant long-term objective. The conclusions highlight the importance of ensuring the cooperation of countries of origin and of transit in joint management and in border control and also in readmission, which is discussed in conclusion No 34. The conclusions confirmed that it is necessary to carry out a systematic assessment of relations with third countries which do not cooperate in combating illegal immigration in the relevant areas. They point out in this regard that inadequate cooperation by a country could hamper the establishment of closer relations between that country and the EU. In the light of the conclusions from Seville, the Danish Presidency has attached a high priority in its work schedule to the fight against illegal immigration, so that the European Council conclusions can be implemented swiftly. I can inform you that I myself shall be the President-in-Office of the Council when it debates these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two or three days later, on 8 July, I asked this question, hoping specifically that during the summer something would have been done. The problem we have in the European Union, Mr President, and this is neither your fault nor that of the Danish Government, is that our system does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">Between the date on which I asked the first question, the first week of July, and today, thousands of illegal immigrants have entered the Canary Islands, both by sea and by air, and the situation there is unsustainable, and we do not have any reception centres. These islands have a smaller area than the islands of Denmark, and at the moment we do not have any means of solving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would say – and I repeat – that, through no fault of your own or of the Danish Presidency, the Council of the European Union is not following up the proposals that Mr Vitorino has been making for some time now, so that the European Union can in fact establish control.

I am therefore very aware of these problems, and I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that we are very active in this field. I travelled to Athens to discuss problems – specific problems – with what is known as the Dublin II agreement, which determines which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application. I am probably going to Rome next weekend to discuss the same problems. If we adopt the new system – guaranteeing that it is the responsibility of the first country to handle an asylum application – combined with the system of fingerprint exchange, there is some apprehension that certain countries will see particularly large numbers of asylum seekers returned to them and will therefore bear an exceptionally heavy burden. Of course, this will have to be discussed. I do not believe that the problem is very serious; but we do have to consider how we can reassure the governments concerned. There are several ways of doing this, and it is those I am discussing with the relevant governments. This merely by way of convincing Mr Medina Ortega that we are absolutely not passive in this matter; we are extremely active. We have started with the most difficult problems of all, with a view to getting those out of the way, in order that we can not merely realise the wish expressed in the Seville conclusions for the completion of the Dublin system, but also make the best possible progress with the common asylum rules. Although the Presidency has also declared these a high priority, we have not promised to be able to finish drawing them up during the Danish term. We intend to make the best progress we possibly can with the work, and if possible complete it in November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Finalising of the agreement concerning the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission (DG External Relations) a part of the bilateral work concerning the EU’s relations with Russia focused for much of 2001 on energy, environmental protection and nuclear safety. This was meant to be done through the conclusion of the agreement on a Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program, (MNEPR), aimed at cleaning up radioactive waste in north-west Russia and through the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP). Similarly, in the press brief from the Commission (issued on 27 May 2002) before the Ninth EU-Russia Summit held in Moscow in May 2002, it was stated that the environment and nuclear safety were going to be discussed and that it would be important to ensure that the Russian federation finalise the MNEPR agreement as soon as possible. In the Joint Statement issued after the EU-Russia Summit, however, no reference was made to the MNEPR. A pledge conference on the NDEP is also to be held on 9 July.</p>

The EU has emphasised at a number of summits that these negotiations should be brought to a swift conclusion. It is true that the common will to conclude the negotiations was not formally expressed in the joint statement from the summit in Moscow on 29 May, but the question was discussed at the summit, and Russia expressed a desire for resolution of the outstanding issues, which are of course taxation and civil liability.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has taken every opportunity to put pressure on Russia to break the deadlock, including at the meetings of the Cooperation Council. The other partner countries, the USA and Norway, have also put her under intense pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU attaches great importance to nuclear safety in North-West Russia and believes that this agreement could contribute to overcoming some of the obstacles to the implementation of projects which could further cooperation on safety in connection with the management of irradiated nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">The inaugural pledging conference for the Support Fund of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) was concluded with a positive result on 9 July of this year in Brussels. The initial contribution to the Support Fund was approximately EUR 110 million, of which EUR 62 million are earmarked for nuclear projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Participants in the conference emphasised that the conclusion of this MNEPR agreement is a necessary precondition for projects within the nuclear sphere entering into operation within the framework of the NDEP.</p>
<p class="contents">The NDEP is an important and practical step towards achieving the objectives, set by the G8, of the Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuclear-safety issue is of decisive importance for environmental protection on the continent of Europe. This particularly concerns Russia, but also other North European countries. The Danish Presidency therefore wishes to work towards bringing the negotiations on the MNEPR agreement to a conclusion by the end of this year.</p>

Without commenting on what was said about Russia’s strategy, I can at least guarantee that we shall not miss an opportunity to put pressure on Russia, as I have said. I have just attended a Ministerial Conference in Greenland in which the Russians also participated. The subject matter was the Northern Dimension, in which I know that Mrs Thors also has a great interest. Many of these matters were also raised there, and I believe that it is important – and here I am sure that we are in agreement – that we establish cooperation with Russia in as many fields as possible, while seeing this as a way of increasing the opportunities for exerting pressure on her in those areas where we believe it important and necessary. I am thinking of Kaliningrad, of the enlargement of NATO and the EU and of the environmental problems in the Murmansk area, which Mrs Thors knows more about than I do. There is every reason for establishing relations with Russia in as many fields as we possibly can, and at the same time for taking advantage of these opportunities to put pressure on her where we believe it really is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, sorry, just a moment. The question was from Mr Crowley. Like its Spanish predecessor, the Danish Presidency attaches great importance to combating drugs. The cornerstone of the Presidency’s drugs programme is the mid-term review of the EU action plan to combat drugs for 2000-2004. The Commission will draw up an evaluation report to be submitted to the European Council at the meeting in Copenhagen in December. The Danish Presidency intends to monitor closely the preparation of the Commission’s report to ensure that the relevant working parties in the Council contribute to the greatest possible extent so that the report is comprehensive and informative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has adopted a balanced approach to the drugs problem and will therefore endeavour to pay as much attention to prevention and drug-supply reduction as to international cooperation. It has presented initiatives on the treatment of criminal drug abusers whilst they are in jail, and on synthetic drugs: the generic classification. In addition, the Presidency intends to step up efforts to address current, and any future, problems regarding the distribution of illicit drugs on the Internet. At international level, meetings will be held with the candidate countries, the USA, Russia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN); and, as far as Latin America is concerned, meetings will be held in preparation for the event to be held during the Greek Presidency. In this way, the Presidency intends to hold meetings with most of the countries which, from the point of view of the EU, are the principal countries of origin and of transit for illicit drugs. The issue of cocaine will be discussed at meetings with the USA and with parties in Latin America. In December, the Presidency will as far as possible inform the European Parliament of the results achieved during the Danish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for asking this question is that over the last eight months several huge seizures of illegal drugs and narcotics have been made across the European Union. In Ireland over the last eight months something in the region of 24 million euros' worth of illegal substances was seized by police and customs officers, in Britain 82 million euros' worth and across the rest of the European Union 297 million euros' worth. The European Union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines. The reason I put a specific request for you to come forward with conclusions or results at the end of the presidency in December is that I was hoping that – linking back to what Mr Hyland was talking about earlier – it would be possible during your time in the presidency to undertake a joint initiative between young people and the presidency to ask young people about the dangers facing them and try and alleviate some of the social problems and issues people face that drive them into the drug culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter which, I believe, concerns the national parliaments in all of our Member States, and it also concerns the Danish Presidency. I cannot say that the question will become a central one, as it is first and foremost the responsibility of national, and often even local, authorities to guarantee these therapies, but I can say that I agree that this is a core problem. In my national parliament, at least, it is the subject of a debate involving heightened emotions and opinions which cut across parties because the plight of these young people is so distressing. At the same time, there is a difficulty with giving them substances to help them out, as this can also cause them to become dependent in some other way.

<p class="contents">During Council Question Time on 3 July, the Council was tackled and alerted both by Mr Carlos Carnero González and myself about the human rights violations and serious physical torture of members of the democratic opposition practiced by Teodoro Obiang’s regime. I urged the Council Presidency to take ‘immediate action’, reminding the Minister that it is not a question simply of more or less euphemistically condemning the situation, but of ‘exercising the strength of the European Union’, using every possible political and diplomatic means to put an end to this inhuman situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Two days later, Juan Ondó Nguema, one of those sentenced in the Marfil Cinema trial without any legal guarantees whatever, according to all international observers, died in the Black Beach prison as a result of the ill-treatment inflicted on him while he was being interrogated by the police, and of his having been deprived of food and water in the days preceding his death.</p>

<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the country’s dictator, Teodoro Obiang, has so far ignored all calls from the international community for the trials to be cancelled, for the prisoners to be released and for the torture to cease, is the Council intending to take any urgent joint action in support of democracy in Equatorial Guinea, including applying the Cotonou Agreement human-rights protection provisions, bolstering the UN’s activities and involving the USA? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all recall that the EU, directly after the sentence was passed, made a declaration calling upon the relevant authorities to take the necessary measures to have the sentences reviewed and ensure that the fundamental rights of the accused were respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has on a number of occasions expressed deep concern at the deterioration in the human rights situation, and, following the death of Juan Ondó Nguema, the Council debated reports concerning the causes. At that time, neither the government’s nor the opposition’s explanation could be confirmed. According to the opposition, his death was due to torture and ill-treatment, whereas the government gave the cause of death as a serious lung disease, from which he was allegedly suffering prior to the trial. Against this background, the Council does not intend to take emergency measures at this stage, but will continue its investigations into the circumstances leading to Nguema’s death. The EU will employ appropriate political and diplomatic means in order to put pressure on the authorities in Equatorial Guinea to bring about an improvement in the human rights situation in general and to promote democratic reforms in that unfortunate country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is of course yet another argument for maintaining the pressure and availing ourselves of all the means to obtain information and exert pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time we asked for an appeal to be made, for pressure to be exerted. Two days later, on 5 July, to be precise, one of those convicted in the judgment that incarcerated dozens of opponents in Black Beach, Juan Ondó Nguema, died as a result of the maltreatment he suffered, and due to water and sleep deprivation during the last days of his life.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know that the world is often cruel and that, of course, neither Europe nor the Council can solve all of its problems or shoulder all of its tragedies. This, however, was a very specific, localised problem.</p>
