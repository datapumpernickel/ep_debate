<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paulsen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on animal by-products involves strict separation into three categories. I would like to remind you that category 1 includes the risk material and is primarily covered by the regulation on TSEs recently adopted by Parliament for the third time. Some proposed amendments contradict the regulation on TSEs which we have recently adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Category 1 covers risk material. Category 2 includes animals which have died a natural death. The third category includes material classified as by-products from animals slaughtered which passed the health inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has chosen, as I myself have, to support the approach of the Commission and attempted to improve the practical regulatory framework and, above all, to make it more stringent, for the principles in this report are simple but things are considerably more difficult in practice. Implementation in particular will be difficult. As such, we require strict separation of the material from the three categories. There is also a need for strict separation of facilities, transport routes, etc. I can add that it is likely that, in future legislation, we will have to require the same separation of feed plants or lines for different types of feed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to mention that all material in categories 1 and 2 is to be marked with an indelible dye and odorant so that they cannot, either deliberately or through negligence, re-enter the feed production chain, for example. Naturally, the same rules which apply to domestic production are also to apply to export, re-export and import.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the committee, I am very pleased that ‘cannibalism’ has been put a stop to in this way. This means that pigs can no longer be fed on their fellow species. However, I would ask you to note that the total ban on feeding ruminants on all forms of animal protein remains and is regulated in the regulation on TSEs, <span class="italic">not </span>here. Personally, I am also very pleased to see that, from today onwards, fat from category 2 may only be used as fertiliser or ideally as fuel oil. In my opinion, it is vital that, at some point, we break the enrichment of heavy metals, PCBs and dioxins.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now my hope that Parliament will adopt these principles laid down by a strong majority. I must therefore turn to Amendment No 100 from the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. This proposal, which was presented in the committee and voted down, seeks to permanently ban all meat and bone meal, with the exception of fish meal, in all animal feed. I would ask you to think this through. We know the catastrophe we caused when we turned ruminants into omnivores. Even now we can see problems in attempting to turn omnivores into vegetarians. I appeal for humility in the face of nature’s own system. We must not manipulate it a second time. Instead, a better way is to vote in favour of the proposal from the Green Group, Amendment No 64, which enjoins Member States to submit, before 1 February 2003, a report on the uniform implementation of the provisions laid down in this new regulation. After that, we will discuss lifting the temporary ban on meat and bone meal which is now in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like you to vote against Amendments Nos 22 and 33. These would in fact sabotage part of the categorisation and complicate it. There is no great need to test whether a chicken dead of natural causes should be placed in category 2 instead of category 1.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to new technology, I strongly advocate trying new technology, never preventing development. I therefore submitted a proposal myself, which was adopted by the committee and which permits the use of new methods approved by the scientific committees. This Amendment No 43 opens up every opportunity for different types of new technology once we obtain them and once they are approved. I would therefore like to see us voting against Amendments Nos 20, 25, 26, 35 and 43 where these address a particular new technology, namely alkaline hydrolysis. This may be an excellent technique, but I do not think it should be included five times in a regulation. That would be legal overkill, to put it mildly<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also appeal to you to vote against Amendment No 36, as this is far too narrow compared with the Commission’s original proposal. As the text is now worded, serious zoonoses, i.e. diseases which affect both animals and people, would be exempt from this legislation. In other words, it would only concern animal diseases. This means that serious infectious diseases such as salmonella, listeria and even tuberculosis, would be exempt from this regulation. This would be devastating for public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 23 exempts, for example, sheep and goats which have died of natural causes from the specification risk material. This clearly conflicts with the regulation on TSEs and is probably impossible in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I have chosen to support the amendments on control of household waste in terms of the risks of foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever submitted by the Green Group, i.e. Amendments Nos 102 and 103. It is good if we obtain clear rules, but these amendments might not properly resolve the main question in this context, namely the clash in terms of cannibalism and household waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end – not before time – by thanking the Commission and the Council’s working party for a very constructive, creative and valuable dialogue and my shadow rapporteurs for their assistance and help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would have saved us billions, and it would have prevented a great deal of animal and human suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">After that introductory comment, may I also hand out a few bouquets. First of all, let me thank Mrs Paulsen. In my long years of parliamentary work, I have seldom experienced such close and constructive cooperation in a specialised political field. It always gave me great pleasure to engage in the discussions about these amendments and proposed improvements to the text. And let me also thank Commissioner Byrne. Although his institution was somewhat slow to act, he himself then set to work vigorously and presented a good proposal. But I must also thank the European Parliament, which has been very consistent on this issue – from the preparatory work of the Committee of Inquiry to the resolutions we have drawn up here; not least among the results of this consistent approach is the fact that we have now secured codecision rights in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression – and this is not meant to detract from your invaluable contribution, Mr Byrne – that, whenever the codecision procedure is applied, the Commission’s proposals are more concrete, more punctilious and better adapted from the outset to the wishes and the working methods of the European Parliament; these proposals serve as an example of the way we should be working here all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, let me say that the Agriculture Committee will take special care to ensure that imports to and exports from the European Union are subject to these strict safety precautions and that we obtain a funding system which will guarantee equal treatment for all farms in the European Union when it comes to disposing of high-risk substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there have been two disasters in British agriculture in recent years. These are BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, which is still raging in my region. Both have had a devastating effect on individual farmers and the industry as a whole. Public confidence has been destroyed. Our markets have been destabilised and the taxpayer has had to fork out billions to compensate farmers for infected and suspected animals. Many have seen generations of work literally go up in smoke on the funeral pyres, which are still burning. Most disturbing of all, it is a fact that because of BSE people have died, not the large numbers forecast by some scientists, but even the death of one young person is one too many for a family. We still do not know the final death toll of variant CJD.</p>
<p class="contents">These two epidemics have one thing in common: they can both be directly linked to feeding animal waste back to animals. There is a debate as to how the BSE epidemic started. The latest theory is that it came from deer; but it could have been a mutation or it could have been around for years. The fact is that it was multiplied by the recycling of waste into meat and bone meal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initial reaction in the United Kingdom was to introduce a ruminant ban on meat and bone meal. That did not work because of cross-contamination. Feed was contaminated in the mills, in the transport system or on farms containing different classes of livestock. So in the UK we opted for a complete ban. Mrs Paulsen wants to fine-tune the partial ban to include the non-cannibalistic reintroduction of meat and bone meal from category 3 material, that is, material which is suitable for human consumption. She wants to feed chickens to pigs and pigs to chickens. I know that chickens are omnivores but I am sure that they do not naturally live on pork.</p>
<p class="contents">If the rules were obeyed we would have no problem. My worry is about cross-contamination. We have already had specified risk material found on beef carcases imported into the UK on 15 occasions since January: beef from the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Italy – and Germany, which accounted for seven of the cases. If we cannot get it right for the beef for human consumption, if we cannot get it right in Germany, which has one of the best records in the EU, how can we expect that the waste will be correctly segregated in Greece or Italy or Spain? We should therefore keep to the ban on meat and bone meal. Amendment No 100 facilitates this continued ban.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to foot-and-mouth. We had an epidemic in the UK in 1967 that was linked to the feeding of swill. We introduced strict controls. Those strict controls have not been implemented correctly on every farm, otherwise we would not have the massive epidemic that we have at the moment. It is important that catering waste is included in these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Paulsen on the inclusive way that she has approached the other groups on this issue and in particular the practical improvements that have been suggested. They include those on waste incineration, allowing small-farm incinerators to continue; on allowing burial on farm in remote areas; on the exemption of manure produced on farms; on the uses of meat and bone meal as fertilizers, given the safeguards that exist; also, on the alternatives to rendering, such as alkaline hydrolysis.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot lower our guard, because by recycling animal by-products as feed we risk also recycling the pathogens that cause BSE, foot-and-mouth and other diseases. The economic advantages of doing this pale into insignificance compared with the devastation that has been the direct result of this risky practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on the way she has handled this complex matter and, as Mr Goodwill said, has brought the committee once again to a consensus. My group commends her approach and will support the bulk of the amendments which have been tabled in the Committee on the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one or two points on the nature of the scourges we face. Mr Goodwill said that we have had these two great disasters but there is a third disaster which produced them. That was the indifference, and sometimes the greed, of those who stood by while the methods of rendering animal waste and feeding it back to animals became more and more extensive and the potential for disaster therefore even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is not a moment when we can happily contemplate the intra-species recycling of animal protein or indeed anything which brings about a further degree of risk in our agricultural system. We are still learning from the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the United Kingdom. In regard to the disposal of animal waste we have found that one attempt to avoid risk has faced us with another risk. When we look at incineration, when we look at burial and look at the hazards, created by the 1% of farms that have still been using swill for pigs, we see additional risks on each side. That is why I too support the idea of looking at alternatives which minimise risk. Alkaline hydrolysis is one such method.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be able to show that we are ahead of this particular scourge. The problem in the past was that we were like countries preparing for the last war and not the next one. We are constantly struggling with the element of unknown risk. Mrs Paulsen's proposals have gone a long way towards improving what the Commission has tried to do in relation to the disposal of TSEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My view on this matter is, on the one hand, that of the producers and, on the other, that of a country with small volumes and long distances. Initially I want to say that Mrs Paulsen has done a thorough and good job. I would particularly like to thank her for also having taken into account the problems of less densely populated areas, which I represent, in Amendment No 69, in which local disposal is permitted in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">My problem in relation to the proposal is why the precautions are identical for the entire area of the EU if the risks in some areas are non-existent. This will cause these areas unnecessary costs. Already now, for example, costs are greater for producers in the northern area due to natural conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that instead of only following principles, we should combine them with common sense. In my country’s only animal waste plant different categories of waste can still be separated from each other, but separating waste from different species of animal seems extremely difficult as we are looking at such small volumes. Therefore, the goal of stopping cannibalism, good in itself, should be taken as a guideline and a common sense solution should be sought. After all, natural cannibalism does exist as a phenomenon in the animal kingdom. How will these kinds of animal be treated in the future? Directives do not prevent natural cannibalism in animals. Although we are now accepting Parliament’s opinion on the directive proposal, we still need to think about these things. Here I am not defending intensive farming but I would like to see the different conditions in different areas better taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some 16 million tonnes of animal waste have to be disposed of every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 4 December 2000, a total ban has been in place on feeding farm animals animal protein. The proposal for a Regulation which we are debating today describes how we must deal with animal waste from now on, and how undesired products must be prevented from ending up in the food chain. The proposal is creating order in the sector, as well as clearly separated waste streams which must under no circumstances be mixed together.</p>
<p class="contents">In her introduction, Mrs Paulsen very clearly pinpointed all bottlenecks. This Regulation is of crucial importance. If it transpires that the subdivision into three categories, the compulsory separation of waste streams and the prevention of cannibalism in the sector are not, or not sufficiently, being complied with and that fraud is, or remains, too prominent, we can assume that the political pre-conditions for allowing the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed for pigs and chickens have not been met. Then an appeal to enforce a total ban will rightly ensue.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask for your massive support for Amendment No 64 to Article 26, which states that the interim ban on feeding animals all kinds of animal by-products must not be extended to the date on which this regulation enters into force, as is the Commission’s wish, but to the date on which this regulation is fully implemented in the Member States. In the light of this, we want a report from the Member States, before 1 February 2003, on the uniform application of this regulation, and only upon receipt of this report can the debate on the lifting of the total ban begin. We must be certain that the regulation works, that fraud is practically ruled out and that the sector has drawn the necessary lessons from the crisis. I believe that this regulation offers the sector a fair chance. The sector will hopefully take that chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An agricultural policy in which animals are fed in a responsible manner. Both on ethical and scientific grounds, we must abandon cannibalism. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that ruminants have not been created to eat animal, but vegetable, proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that at the moment, a large majority is in favour of strict measures, but we will need to keep our finger on the pulse during implementation too. If we want to see the impact of these measures, the Member States will also need to closely monitor compliance with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased to observe that a loophole in the legislation on incineration plants is being plugged. Unfortunately, during the recent foot-and-mouth crisis in England, we have had to witness huge funeral pyres of dead animals. Such a method of destruction is certainly no guarantee against infection, and does not benefit air quality. I hope that these pyres will no longer be needed in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, in connection with the BSE crisis, you hit the nail on the head when you stated that animal material which is not fit for human consumption must not be authorised for use in the production of animal feed either. Anyone who is familiar with the functioning of the food chain will surely see the logic of this principle. I thank the Commission for its firm proposal dividing animal by-products into three categories. It would have been far simpler to prohibit them all without further ado. That approach has been adopted by the German Federal Government, for example. The EU, however, has taken the more prudent path, in my opinion, even if it is the more difficult path, as we are all aware. This difficulty lies in the fact that the materials in the three categories must be registered, stored, processed and marketed separately and that evidence of these operations must be kept. In our experience, such a requirement presupposes the establishment of an inspection system.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has reintroduced the formulation from the Directive fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition in the EU, and there is a minimum standard here that we must not undercut, namely the principle that experts from the Commission may conduct on-the-spot inspections in cooperation with the authorities in the Member States. The end justifies the means, the end being that valuable nutrient sources are not simply destroyed but used for a useful purpose – this applies to kitchen waste too – while anything that has no place in the food chain is rejected and destroyed. One thing is clear: we must ensure that appropriate feed mixes are used for each species; in other words, we are opposed to cannibalism. This is also something that inspections will have to prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks are due to Mrs Paulsen for her report, which makes the Commission proposal even more specific on several important points, and I hope that the ladies and gentlemen of the House will give it their emphatic support.</p>

I cannot understand why anyone would want to impose a permanent ban on this valuable source of protein. I do, however, support the present temporary ban on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed. The current rules and checks must be strictly applied. Once this is guaranteed, it should be possible to use meat and bone meal once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Another specific point concerns the use of leftovers from large restaurants and catering establishments. For decades these leftovers have been used to produce a highly nutritious pig feed. This must remain possible in future, which is why I support Amendment No 102 as tabled by the Greens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words on the avoidance of cannibalism in the feeding of animals. I believe that the separation by species of material for processing into meat and bone meal would be very difficult to achieve. Pigs, hens, fish and so on have no scruples about eating their own kind. I am at a complete loss to understand why animals are now being expected to comply with human ethical standards. I hope we shall remain realistic on this point, because the proposed compulsory separation of by-products by species will not enable us to prevent cannibalism among animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The term ‘by-products’ as used here refers primarily to meat and bone meal. In its proposal, the Commission formulated a conditional ban, in other words a graduated ban, on the use of meat and bone meal in feeds and fertilisers. Mrs Paulsen has developed very effectively the ideas presented by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The division into three categories is to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Commission only authorises the use of Category 1 meal in animal feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133°C and a pressure of 3 bar. The Commission proposal, as amended in committee, is therefore consistent with the demand of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE for strict separation of animal waste products into those that are basically fit for human consumption and those that come from infected and sick animals. Healthy waste products from the abattoir are valuable providers of protein which we should not discard. Omnivores really will eat everything. We should not try to re-educate them. As far as ruminants are concerned, it goes without saying that meat and bone meals are taboo.</p>
<p class="contents">We need responsibly applied and controlled technology for the production and processing of meat and bone meal, and we need still more research. If we proceed on the basis of this regulation and transpose it in our Member States, we shall have built firm foundations from which we can go on to guarantee the safety of our foodstuffs and to ensure that our consumers are well supplied with good food.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to express its agreement with the terms and conclusions of these reports, and with the proposals, as amended. We all remember the dioxin crisis which, in 1999, hit my country, Belgium. This dioxin contamination of foodstuffs of animal origin called to account those who were responsible for public health, and greatly shook consumers’ confidence in the system of inspecting animal feedingstuffs. It also called into question the quality of the meat produced. At that time, fats and oils were at the centre of the dispute. It was therefore necessary to take strong measures to protect public health and also, not least, to restore confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisional ban on all feeds derived from animal products for animals intended for human consumption, as ordered by the Council in December 2000, was necessary, but the problem of by-products of animal origin must be addressed. The proposed regulation, as amended so as to strengthen food safety, is aimed at achieving this public-health objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We paid very close attention to the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee, which stated that products derived from animals which are found, following a health inspection, to be unsuitable for human consumption, must not enter the food chain. We are therefore in full agreement with the principles defined in the explanatory statement to the regulation, according to which only the by-products of carcases authorised for human consumption can be used as raw materials for animal feedingstuffs or human food.</p>
<p class="contents">The separate treatment of by-products, fats and domestic refuse is likely to consolidate the desired safety objective. The classification of by-products, the separation of categories and the labelling of substances falling within Categories 1 and 2 are measures intended to consolidate the objectives being pursued. Moreover, product traceability, storage in transit, controls on the processing industry and derogation systems are likewise provisions which support those objectives. Finally, the solutions proposed regarding substitution, utilisation and elimination also contribute to the clarification that is awaited in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, the voluntarist action adopted by virtue of the proposed regulation is in line with what the public expects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE. The other is, of course, the regulation on TSEs, which enters into force on 1 July.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot overemphasise the importance of this proposal. We are faced with a very stark choice. Over 16 million tonnes of animal by-products not intended for human consumption are produced each year in the EU. These 16 million tonnes do not disappear into thin air. They have to be disposed of and processed. This can be done in a manner which is safe, economic and effective for health and the environment, or it can be done in an unregulated manner, which puts public health and the environment at risk. All Community institutions would be collectively responsible if we did not insist on the first method of disposal. That is exactly what the Commission proposed in October 2000: a framework which will allow these 16 million tonnes to be processed safely and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is linked very closely with the issue of BSE. The reason is obvious. A significant part of the animal by-products of which we speak is specified risk material. It is essential that these products in particular are collected, processed and destroyed effectively. The proposal will achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been hugely encouraged by the very constructive approach of Parliament to this proposal. There has been a very healthy discussion which has focused on improving the text. I am satisfied that the emerging text gives overriding priority to the need to protect public health and the environment. And it does so in a manner which can work. When this regulation enters into force, we will have a system that is state of the art.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to single out the role played by your rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, who made enormous efforts to bring this proposal to this stage so quickly. Due to her and your efforts, I am in a position today to agree to the spirit and principles of the vast majority of your amendments, subject to some editorial changes. I shall also briefly mention the proposal for a directive amending Directives 90/425 and 92/118. Clearly time does not allow me to discuss in detail the Commission's position on all the amendments, so I will focus on the key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we can accept amendments on recitals which match provisions in the text and those which highlight the historical background, including previous Parliament resolutions on the safety of animal feed. I agree to remove the reference to increasing productivity in a recital, but the original reference to the Treaty should be retained. However, we must reject amendments introducing recitals which are not matched by provisions in the text, or deleting recitals referring to the text, as this is contrary to correct legal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept bringing genetic material in the scope of the proposal, although I would clarify that it covers only the disposal of genetic material when it is no longer needed for reproductive purposes. I can support amendments aimed at extending the prohibition of intra-species recycling to animal species other than ruminants; for these species cannibalism has been prohibited since 1994. As we learned from the development of the BSE epidemic, the practice of intra-species recycling may increase the risk of recycling potential infectivity due to the absence of a species barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept the introduction of additional requirements to improve the traceability of products. However, the proposed requirements on the marking of unprocessed Category 1 material can be accepted only in the case of specified risk material. The proposed marking of unprocessed Category 2 material, including manure, cannot be accepted for the same reasons. Furthermore the olfactory and denaturing marking can be accepted only in principle, as at this stage we have not yet identified an appropriate and safe marker that has these qualities. I would like to note that adding an olfactory marker to manure may be, to put it mildly, a little superfluous. However we understand your general concern and will bear it in mind for the future. The Commission will not hesitate to establish such additional rules on marking should this be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept the need to introduce additional and stricter requirements to avoid cross-contamination. The Commission proposal already establishes a complete separation during collection and transport of animal waste and a complete separation of plants dedicated to feed production. We can accept a derogation for burial and burning of cadavers and specified risk materials in remote areas and in case of outbreaks of serious transmissible diseases, because of the danger of propagating health risks or because of a lack of disposal capacity. We particularly welcome the conditions suggested to prevent abuse of this derogation. Two different definitions of remote areas are proposed. We could accept a combination of both.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree to lay down public health requirements for incinerators which are not covered by the scope of Directive 2000/76 on the incineration of waste. We can accept the introduction of the legal possibility of reviewing the authorised method of disposal following new scientific advice. We cannot accept adding a specific new technology, as this is unnecessary and in my view premature.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept the inclusion of catering waste in the scope of the regulation, but we must clarify that such waste is covered by the proposal only when destined to specific purposes in order to avoid duplication within environmental legislation. We can accept a definition of catering waste, on condition that it covers catering waste from household kitchens, in order to ensure consistency with forthcoming legislation on classical swine fever. We can accept classifying catering waste as Category 3 material, on condition that catering waste from international means of transport comes under the highest risk Category 1 and is destroyed as required by existing Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the proposal to allow the continuation of swill-feeding using catering waste. First of all, this practice is not compatible with the prohibition of intra-species recycling and with the demand for full traceability of feed ingredients, both of which have been called for by Parliament. Secondly, the recent dioxin crisis and the current outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease adequately illustrate why the continuation of this feeding practice is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the exclusion of manure produced on farm from the scope of the proposal as this would reduce health protection. We cannot limit the spreading of manure only in cases where it is suspected of disseminating an OIE List A disease, as certain Member States have additional eradication measures for diseases not included in that list, such as salmonella. We can agree to clarify that a harmonised health certificate for the trade of manure shall be laid down by commitology. The request to annex this certificate to the regulation is superfluous and therefore unacceptable. We accept the proposal to spell out the possibility of authorising equivalent processing treatments for manure following scientific advice, which in any case is not prevented by the Commission proposal. However, it is premature and therefore not acceptable to make reference to a concordance table before the evaluation by the Scientific Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the proposed inclusion of additional animal by-products in the Category 1. It is excessive, unnecessary and will create confusion with existing legislation, in particular with the TSE regulation, without making a real contribution to increased safety. Testing for BSE is properly the competence of the TSE regulation and I believe it deals quite adequately with this. Furthermore, it is not practical to test all animals for all known diseases. It is unrealistic. Animals which die on farm are in any case excluded from the food and feed chain.</p>
<p class="contents">The net result of these amendments would be to prohibit the use of an important volume of animal by-products in bio-gas and composting. It is proposed to require the use of pressure-cooking standards for animal by-products even if the resulting material is incinerated. For reason of consistency with the TSE regulation, we can accept that this process be used before incineration if required by the national competent authority. This would allow Member States to require this process when, for example, a long period of storage is needed before incineration. We note that many other Parliament amendments would maintain this flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept a ban on the use of rendered fats from Category 2 material for the production of fat derivatives for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. We cannot accept restrictions on the importation of ruminant products due to a TSE risk, as such restrictions are laid down by the TSE regulation. Furthermore, the safety of ruminant fats is currently under revision by the Scientific Steering Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We can agree to an earlier date of entry into force of the regulation and welcome the proposal that Member States forward a report to the Commission on the implementation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept the exclusion of dead sheep and goats from the definition of specified risk material, as this is not in line with the TSE regulation. I cannot accept the exclusion of solid dung and composting from the prohibition on spreading material on pasture land, because manure in any form is already excluded by this prohibition and there is no justification for excluding compost from a general policy on the spreading of material on pasture land.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept the principle of prohibiting the exportation of Category 1 and Category 2 material. We can agree to the principle of refrigeration of raw Category 3 material. We can accept adding products which failed import checks to Category 3 material. However, for reasons of consistency with the annex and existing Community legislation, we would clarify that this shall apply unless the products are redispatched or their importation is accepted under restrictions laid down under Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the introduction of a permanent ban on meat and bone meal in feed, as the feed ban comes under the competence of the recently adopted TSE regulation. In fact, pending the adoption and implementation of this proposal, I am proposing an extension of the current total feed ban under the legal provisions of the TSE regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition I believe that animal proteins produced in accordance with this present proposal can be used safely to feed animals other than ruminants. The permanent ban on feeding animal proteins to animals other than ruminants is not scientifically justified. It could be challenged in the WTO and would have enormous environmental and economic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept a ban on certain local feeding practices as this would seriously disrupt existing national schemes for the protection of endangered species. The conditions established by the proposal to control this feeding practice are stricter than the current one and are in line with the Commission's inspectors' recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the report and the many useful and constructive amendments contained therein. Mr President, following your earlier suggestion, I propose to circulate the amendments in summary form<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must find some sort of a system to ensure that the comments made by members of the Commission actually reach our ears – either the speeches will have to be shortened or the Commissioners will have to be given more time to deliver them. One way or the other, we cannot expect the House to make do with the present system. It makes unreasonable demands of the Commissioner and of us who are trying to listen to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
