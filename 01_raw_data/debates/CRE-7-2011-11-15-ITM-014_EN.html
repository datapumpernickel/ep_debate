<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Court of Auditors. </span>– Madam President, I am honoured to be present here today before this Parliament to participate in this debate on the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report on the implementation of the 2010 European Union budget, which I already presented last week to the Committee on Budgetary Control of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As in previous years, the Court’s annual report mainly covers the reliability of the 2010 European Union accounts and the regularity of transactions underlying them. This year, it also includes a chapter on the results of the European Union’s spending.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reliability of the European Union accounts, the Court concludes that the 2010 accounts present fairly the financial position of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows at the year end. Nevertheless, there remains scope to improve the quality of financial reporting and the underlying information systems – not least with respect to financial engineering instruments in relation to which the Court considers that the Commission must revisit the relevant accounting rule and take further action to ensure that the necessary information is available from Member States to improve the Commission’s supervision of those financial instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards regularity of revenue and expenditure, revenue and commitments underlying the accounts for the year ending 31 December 2010 are legal and regular in all material respects. In contrast, the payments underlying the accounts were affected by material error, with an estimated error rate of 3.7% for the European Union spending as a whole. It should be noted that this is not an estimate of fraud, as there are many reasons why errors may occur. Overall, control systems were found to be only partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion, energy and transport was the most error prone group of policy areas of European Union spending. After falling in previous years, the estimated error rate in 2010 was higher than in 2009, leading to an increase in the estimated error rate for payments as a whole compared to 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">A relatively small number of wholly ineligible projects and serious breaches of European Union and national procurement rules accounted for much of the error found. There continues to be room for improving Member States’ correction mechanisms and audit activities, not least because some of the errors found could have been detected or corrected by Member States on the basis of available information before payments were made.</p>
<p class="contents">For the other groups of policy areas, the audit results were relatively stable. For agriculture and natural resources, the estimated error rate was 2.3%, slightly above the materiality threshold and systems were partially effective. Direct payments covered by the Integrated Administrative Control System, which accounted for almost EUR 40 billion of the EUR 57 billion spent, were found to be free from material error, but spending on rural development remains prone to error.</p>
<p class="contents">For research and other internal policies and external aid, development and enlargement, the Court concluded that payments were not materially affected by error, although systems remained only partially effective and there was a significant risk of error for interim and final payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for administrative and other expenditure, the Court concluded that it was not affected by material error and that systems were effective as in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission provides its own assessments of the capacity of internal control systems to ensure the regularity of spending in the annual activity reports of the Directorates-General and in its Synthesis report. In those reports, the Commission includes a number of reservations highlighting areas of risk. However, the Court finds that the scope and scale of those reservations made for the 2010 financial year should have been greater in several areas, including in cohesion, where the Court considers that the Commission’s approach may lead to an underestimation of the amounts at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual activity reports of the Directorates-General also provide a self-assessment of performance, including the results achieved from European Union spending. This year, for the first time, the Court presents the results of its review of the performance reporting on three Directorates-General responsible for much EU spending.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court recommends that the Commission puts more focus on performance in Annual Activity Reports, including on economy and efficiency, and that it sets appropriate targets for assessing progress towards achieving multiannual objectives. In addition, the Court makes recommendations in areas of shared management for improving the definition of objectives and indicators and the monitoring of progress and results based on the main performance audit results in the Court’s Special Reports.</p>
<p class="contents">That completes my summary of the main points in the annual report for the 2010 financial year. I believe this year’s annual report confirms the main message of previous years. After many years of incremental improvements in systems, there remain significant risks to the regularity of payments and scope for improving the results obtained from European Union spending. The proposals for sectoral legislation governing spending after 2013 provide an opportunity to address those risks by reforming legislative frameworks and redesigning control systems. Reforms should focus on improving both regularity of the performance while also reducing the costs of control and ensuring adequate accountability. In addition, there have been a number of significant developments in European Union economic governance that risk giving rise to gaps in public accountability and public audit.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, the Heads of the European Union Supreme Audit Institutions and the European Court of Auditors expressed their concerns on this matter and they called for the principles of transparency, accountability and public audit to be respected when public funds are at stake. The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism was identified as an opportunity to apply these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting transparency and accountability is a responsibility shared by all institutions. It is crucial now, when the pressure on public finances is high, the importance of the European Union meeting its objectives is great, and the need to build citizens’ trust in the European Union and its institutions is acute. I trust that the annual report I have had the honour to present to you today will provide the European Parliament with a sound basis for playing its role in ensuring accountability in respect of the European Union funds for the 2010 financial year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Algirdas Šemeta, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, President Caldeira, honourable Members of the Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, the key messages outlined by President Caldeira demonstrate that over the years, we have made progress in improving the financial management of the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2010, the accounts are clean; all commitments and revenues as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards payments, the overall level of quantifiable errors found by the Court is 3.7%. For internal policies, external action and administration, the level of quantifiable errors is below the materiality threshold of 2%.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is fairly stable with a 2.3% level of quantifiable errors. Moreover, the Court says that for 2010, direct aid – about EUR 400 billion paid to millions of farmers – is free from material error.</p>
<p class="contents">But some other policy errors and, in particular, cohesion, still deserve serious efforts. Implementation of the EU budget in the areas where management is shared with the Member States is a complex issue, and reducing errors there remains our main challenge and priority. In 2010, the majority of the errors were concentrated on seven operational programmes in three Member States. However, the analysis of the errors in cohesion policy presented with the cohesion package last month shows that from 2006 until 2009, more Member States contributed to the level of errors, including so-called net payers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that it is not primarily the design of the programmes that is wrong, but the way they are implemented on the spot. As President Caldeira said, in the majority of cases, the Member States’ authorities had sufficient information to have detected and corrected the errors prior to certifying the expenditure to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is unacceptable. It reflects a lack of responsibility by the authorities involved despite their enhanced obligations under shared management as required by the Treaty. The Commission has confronted the Member States concerned with those findings. We expect to receive quick and appropriate responses from them in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, of course, continue to act preventively, providing guidance, assistance and advice to Member States’ authorities, but it will also continue to strictly apply corrective measures such as interruptions and suspensions of payments and financial corrections.</p>
<p class="contents">For the next financial period, the Commission has proposed the definite reduction of the financial allocation to Member States that do not address effectively the weaknesses in their systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue raised in the Court’s report refers to the financial engineering instruments. Last week, several members of the Committee on Budgetary Control expressed concerns regarding the management of these instruments and their inherent risks at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the problems identified by the Court of Auditors have been addressed. The necessary adjustments have been made in due time before the closure of the 2010 accounts. Moreover, the Commission has already proposed amending the current legal basis to obtain systematically the information needed from the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the effectiveness of the systems, it is worth noting that the Court found that more than 90% of the errors are identified outside the Commission at the level of beneficiaries. This is of particular importance when we know that 80% of the budget is spent under shared management. That said, the Commission agrees with the Court that the definition of objectives and indicators and the monitoring of progress and results need further improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, identification of objectives, targets, milestones and key performance indicators are now systematically included in all our legislative proposals for the next financial period. The Commission will issue the very first evaluation report based on Article 318 of the Treaty by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words on the various European financial assistance mechanisms. The Commission agrees that the principles of transparency, accountability and public audit should be respected when public funds are at stake. Today, the Court of Auditors is entitled to audit the balance of payments facility and the European financial stabilisation mechanisms to the extent that they are guaranteed by the EU budget, and Note 9 to the Union’s accounts gives adequate information on the existing lending operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the European Court of Auditors has confirmed that the Commission is on the right track. Despite these rather good results, there remains ample room for improvement, and the Commission takes full responsibility for addressing these areas together with the other financial actors involved, in particular, the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Several new measures included in our proposals for the next generation of EU spending programmes are inspired by the Court and the Discharge Authority’s recommendations. Whether these measures will become EU law depends now on the colegislators – the Council and this Assembly. The Commission will facilitate the negotiations and hopes these necessary improvements will be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think you have succeeded in the feat of presenting more details while, at the same time, making it easier to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me start by putting this year’s discharge procedure in context. Confidence in the way Europe manages its budgetary discipline and administration of public funds has been shaken to the core. It is up to us, in conjunction with the Commission, the Court of Auditors and, above all, the Member States, to start to show that Europe, in the shape of the EU, is at least successfully dealing with these issues and, in so doing, to rebuild confidence. Therefore, this year’s discharge procedure is a particularly important one. Nothing must be hidden away, nothing must escape critical inspection – and that is our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">If I were to be unkind and summarise the message that I heard from the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, and Commissioner Šemeta, I would say that I have understood the Court of Auditors to be saying that the situation is stable and that we do not see any dramatic changes. The Commission agrees, but indicates that we are on the right road and sees progress in the areas of aid and research. The problem is simply that stable is not good enough. We were disappointed last year. To hear that things look about the same this year is, unfortunately, not good news. What I think stands out from the stable situation is, sadly, the negative aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">If I were to make three quick observations then, firstly, there is the fact that we have serious problems with cohesion policy. In this area, the Member States have a large degree of responsibility. A small number of Member States – often the same ones – account for the lion’s share of the problems year after year, which is unacceptable. It is particularly worth noting what the Court of Auditors points out, namely that 58% of the problems are ones that the Member States could have anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">The second observation concerns the question of financial engineering instruments. Reading chapter 4 of the Court of Auditors’ report makes me feel genuinely concerned, particularly as the Commission is saying that we should increase the use of these instruments and that they pose a big risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the question of how the budget crisis will affect the EU budget. We are in the midst of a crisis – a budget crisis – in the Member States. This clearly involves risks for the EU, both financial risks and risks of more errors. We need to examine this. I am grateful to President Caldeira for taking up the problems with the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We need more scrutiny and parliamentary influence in this regard. We promise to talk more about this. Thank you for your excellent work thus far. I look forward to continuing our cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming.</p>
<p class="contents">You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits.</p>
<p class="contents">The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ analysis gives us food for thought. Several figures have already been mentioned. I will not repeat them. I would like to concentrate on perhaps the most important section in this chapter, namely recital 425. It reads as follows: ‘The Court takes the view that, in 58% of the transactions that showed errors, the authorities of Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct at least some of the errors’.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Commissioner did indeed tell us, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, that three Member States, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic, are responsible for two thirds of all the errors. A country like Poland, which is easily the largest recipient of all the funds, has done well, with an error rate of zero. This means that it is possible. I therefore think – as has been acknowledged by many speakers – that, in this discharge procedure, we very much ought to set our sights on the Council. Today, the Council is again not attending the debate and finance ministers are still refusing to sign a statement by which they would make it clear that their administrations, their people in charge of carrying out checks, are working correctly and indeed, that they have made no mistakes or that, in any case, any errors have been properly checked. I and many others, therefore, increasingly believe that we ought to tighten the tap pouring subsidies to those kinds of Member States. We have to suspend payments. We may need to withhold payments. We may need to go to the Court of Justice. We cannot allow this situation to continue. That, I think, is the only language the finance ministers will understand because, in that case, there will be questions asked in the national parliaments: what are you doing? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They should have been here – their presence is quite frankly a must. I think I can repeat what we said when the President of the Court of Auditors attended a sitting of the Committee on Budgetary Control: the work of the Court of Auditors is very important in terms of building respect for the European Union’s institutions, particularly during a crisis, when the European taxpayer will want to look at every euro to see whether it has been spent as it was intended to be spent. It seems to me to be a very sad thing that there are, in fact, so many irregularities in terms of the Cohesion Fund, because this fund is one which is used by the majority of the ‘new’ Member States.

Unfortunately, I cannot be as positive about the EU’s accounts for 2010. As we have already heard, the payments that form the basis of the accounts are seriously defective. That is not all, however. It is also going in the wrong direction. Year after year, we in Parliament have been critical of the far too high error rate in the EU’s management of taxpayers’ money. Every year, however, we have been reassured by the Commission that it is going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the Commission was particularly proud, as I remember. We were told that the overall reduction in errors was due simply to the Commission’s sterling efforts. I recall that I commented on this in my speech on 11 November here in Parliament. I said, and I quote: ‘I am happy to give the Commission the credit, but it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year’. Here we now are, a year later, and the error rate has increased. It is now no longer enough to ask who is responsible. We now also need to ask who will take responsibility.

For those who have been observing this process for a long time, it is not surprising that the Court of Auditors has produced a negative result for 2010. In these very difficult economic times, this amounts to a confession of failure by the European Union, because it clearly indicates that taxpayers’ money is being used illegally or even wasted. The error rate in the EU budget amounts to 3.7%, but this figure can be increased, because the error rate for cohesion, energy and transport stands at 7.7% and this is once again higher than the previous year. In the cases audited by the Court of Auditors, the error rate is 49%, which is equivalent to every other case. We are talking here about the improper use of taxpayers’ money amounting to billions of euro. I am therefore calling on the Commission to put an end to these abuses immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reports from the Court of Auditors of the European Union for the 24 agencies do not make any specific references to the issues of management, public procurement, human resources or performance. There is absolutely no information about some agencies and only general details for others. This year’s reports contain less information than last year’s reports. If these agencies have improved their operation, we need to see figures and arguments to convince us. However, I doubt that, in a year, the 24 agencies’ activities have recorded a good performance all at once. The Court of Auditors has all this information, but has not passed it on to us.</p>
<p class="contents">President Caldeira, you spoke about transparency and accountability. Where are these elements in relation to the analysis of the European agencies’ activities?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the horizontal European agencies report was scheduled for October, postponed until December, and, at the moment, there is no clear information about its completion. We need this report to make a decision about the agencies’ discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is more serious, however, is that the Court of Auditors of the European Union cannot have any credibility in the eyes of European citizens if it does not provide information about how the EUR 768 million, the EU’s contribution to the agencies’ budget in 2010, has been spent, especially now when we are in the midst of a financial crisis and a crisis of confidence. President Caldeira, please provide the Committee on Budgetary Control in November with all the data and reports requested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact is, and we view this with utmost concern, that a trend which, until recently, was controlled within the cohesion policy, a central European policy, is now getting worse. We therefore find that the Commission is seriously looking at revising the information provided by the Court so as to have better instruments available with which to control these accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, other very important items have appeared for the first time in the Court of Auditors’ 2010 report, which covers all the issues related to financial engineering. These herald new concerns. As these are fundamental instruments for expanding and supplementing financing, above all for projects that go beyond a multiannual basis, and which we obviously need in order to continue developing and creating jobs, I would like to ask both Mr Caldeira and Mr Šemeta what results they expect from improved control of these instruments, which are necessary, but open up new problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask about the frequency of mistakes in research, development and innovation policy. Although these are clearly immaterial errors and below the average, the rate is high and, more than anything else, this causes a problem with independent auditors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council cannot be allowed to be absent from such debates, especially since 80% of the funds are spent by Member States in cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors for the sympathetic attitude which it always takes towards Parliament. I think the cooperation is excellent and I hope it will stay that way. The ultimate goal for all of us still is to receive a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS). We all know that that has not been possible in the past seventeen years, and I agree with Mr Fjellner that maintaining the status quo is not satisfactory. Things are getting better, but the ultimate goal must be two per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">We will soon be starting again with the preparatory measures for a new multiannual budget. We also have legislation providing the basis for that. It would be good if the Court of Auditors and the Commission could publish items on where the bottlenecks, in their eyes, really are. It is very good that certain countries are being highlighted, and I think that the Commission should focus on that. As the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have invited the finance ministers of those countries to provide us with a text and an explanation. They have still not responded to that invitation, but we hope that that will happen soon.</p>
<p class="contents">What is essential for Parliament, as indeed was recently confirmed in a vote in this hemicycle, is that Parliament still wants more political responsibility for spending in the Member States. This means that Parliament, as things currently stand, will insist that, in contrast to the current period, all Member States issue a statement of proper financial management of EU funds in the next period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this discussion, which is that Commissioner Šemeta, at last week’s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, named three states that are apparently most at fault in respect of cohesion policy: Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. As I hail from the Czech Republic, and as the Czech Republic is mentioned in this context for the first time, I tried to find out the details behind these statements. The response is simply that 16 projects or payments were audited in the Czech Republic, and four of these were classified among the seriously quantifiable errors. I would not like to cast doubt on the work of the Court of Auditors, of which I have a very high opinion, but I would like to call on the Commission to be more restrained in its statements, as they need to be substantiated first. I welcome greater mutual awareness in these matters, of course, and perhaps much greater awareness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to the Parliament’s discharge, I would like to raise several issues for the Parliament’s consideration in today’s discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to discuss the publications of the internal auditors for the financial year 2010. It is regrettable that this year, reports were not made available on time to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control since previous years’ reports clearly represented an added value for the EP discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was a lack of information about the previous years’ status of Parliament’s accounts. Having available data for previous years will help us, through comparisons, to improve our data analysis and finally improve the quality of our recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the question of security still represents a major issue for many MEPs. However we still lack enough details on the progress of the global security concept. What other concrete measures and what steps will be followed to implement an efficient security system for all of us?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, an important issue mentioned in the Court of Auditors’ annual report is the question of visitors’ groups and the methodology for calculation of the subsidy schemes for these groups. I believe we still need to improve the process through a more transparent and effective reimbursement system.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these are not all the issues that I would like to mention here today. We will discuss all of them in more detail in committee, but I want to highlight that, in these difficult times of budget constraints and challenges, everybody has to make their utmost effort to save EU taxpayers’ money. We rely very much on the European Court of Auditors to provide us with high-quality information about the spending of all EU institutions, including the spending of the European Parliament. We represent the voice of the citizens, but we are also accountable to those citizens for the way we spend their money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the current economic and financial crisis, the pressure on public finances has never been greater and efficient use of public money is more important than ever. Given that political cohesion is at the heart of the debate on the error rate and its impact on the EU budget, it is vital that we underline what is an error and what is not: an error is a transaction which is not fully in keeping with current regulations; error does not mean that funds have been lost or wasted or that fraud has been committed. Furthermore, the statistics illustrate that two-thirds of errors are concentrated in three of the 27 Member States and in seven out of 455 programmes. That means that, with targeted efforts on the part of the Commission and certain Member States, it will be possible to reduce the error rate considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that everyone will agree that, during the next cohesion policy programming period, there should be a greater degree of simplification, transparency, responsibility and controls that marry efficiency with cost, as this will ultimately help us to improve how we protect the financial interests of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access.

The benefits of Structural Funds can be seen right across my country of Wales and it is often the most visible sign of the European Union. Therefore, it would be a great shame if high error rates allowed critics of cohesion policy to undermine it. That is why it is important that issues around procurement policy, eligible projects, eligible costs, supervision and audit are resolved quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say that one of the biggest critics of cohesion policy is the UK Government, yet its error rate for some Structural Funds is higher than most other Member States. Of course, this would not apply to Wales, which has an excellent record on spending its EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would be useful if the Commissioner or the Court informed us about the biggest offenders and what is being done to ensure things improve in those Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I do not wish to insult those fellow Members not working in the Committee on Budgetary Control or working in other Committees who are now honouring us with their presence. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, Commissioner, I fully agree with the key idea of Mr Fjellner. This year’s report indicates that the use of European Union funds is stable. It is stable, but it is unfortunately showing problems. In today’s debate, I would like to point out two important aspects of future stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the EU’s financial management to show a stable and improving trend over the upcoming period, we need efficient, transparent, controllable and readily applicable common rules that provide a guarantee for the appropriate use of funds, and we also need stability as regards the use of potential funding, especially under the Cohesion Funds, ensuring that everyone can expect to receive similar amounts of funding in the upcoming budgetary period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply wish to touch on a subject which I feel is extremely important. I want to pick up on the statement made by Mr Ton Van Lierop, the spokesman on regional issues, who said that it is natural for us to have more errors during this period because all the programmes have been implemented at a normal rate and, in any case, the money is not lost because we will recoup it in a few years. The programmes may have been implemented at a normal rate. However, it is not natural for the actual control systems not to be implemented at a normal rate, as well, and not to be adapted to ensure that the errors are not greater than they were at the start; if anything, they should be smaller.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it in another way, the money is lost. On the one hand, this is because we will not recoup it all and, on the other, because during these wasted years, the money will not be spent where it is needed, as it was intended, and at the time when it was needed. Therefore, I say that we need much better control systems which are much better suited and much more effective in the period ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should point out that the work carried out annually by this institution is particularly important: through the publication of its reports and opinions, it keeps all European citizens objectively informed on topics such as the most significant errors recorded in requests for funds, thereby helping consumers to improve the format of their requests and, consequently, to obtain funds more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I have understood from the President’s speech this afternoon, in 2010, payments underlying the accounts still showed up some relevant errors – some 3.7% of the EU’s spending, which amounts to a total of EUR 122.2 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also happy to hear the information the President wanted to underline, which was that this error percentage does not provide an estimate of cases of fraud. Often, it relates to imprecise calculations of costs declared for projects cofinanced by the EU or declarations of costs which are ineligible when instead, they were thought to be eligible; as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in consideration of the anticipated reduction in funds, I am particularly interested in the 2.3% error rate for agriculture with some substantial differences: the control of spending on direct payments has not brought up relevant errors, while payments for rural development display a higher frequency of error, at no less than 50%. Finally, the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund registered a 27% error rate on examined payments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not just a matter of control; it is one that concerns the entire House here. I myself am coordinator of the regional policy, for the Cohesion Funds, and, as rapporteur, I will also be working on the new regulations for 2014-2020. I believe that we could win major battles with those very regulations by the way in which we define things there. We have, of course, done that for the current 2007-2014 period. That has already improved significantly. We need such broad cooperation in this House as well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, allow me to make two points. First of all, we are referring to the countries concerned by name. That is a very good thing, I think, because it allows you to address the specific issues of these countries. If you see that a handful of countries is responsible for 60 per cent of the errors, you can then apply custom-made solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is to do with public procurement. Forty per cent of the errors concern public procurement. What is actually going on here? It might be that, on the one hand, the legislation is too complicated. On the other hand, it might be that the countries concerned lack the administrative capacity to properly implement the legislation. Therefore, you <span class="italic">either</span> adjust your legislation in that respect – the Commission is also currently looking at that – <span class="italic">or</span> we provide better support, <span class="italic">or</span> significantly reduce the funds for countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me turn to financial innovations, or financial engineering as we call it: this is, in itself, a very good thing, but on top of that, it also means that we should arrive at a point, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, where we have greater transparency. We could score major benefits from that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States have a great deal of responsibility. That is why, for the first time, we have invited the Member States to meet with the committee in order to be involved in the hearing and debate on discharge, because we have some important questions. Why do we have the same problems in the same Member States, often with regard to the same programmes? What can we do about them?</p>
<p class="contents">Shared responsibility must not mean no responsibility. The EU, too, has a responsibility. Even we have a responsibility. Our most important responsibility right now – now that we also have the power of codecision – is probably to learn from the problems, particularly now that we are, in principle, reviewing all sections of the policy areas where we have problems. Will we have to put an end to certain programmes? Will we have to review certain programmes in certain regions? It is not acceptable to simply hide behind the Member States, even if that is where the problems are greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has the right to discontinue certain payments. However, if it is the case that we have the same problems year after year – that is something we talked about a lot last year – then perhaps we should talk more about the grounds on which these payments are resumed if the problems in certain Member States and certain contexts have not been resolved. I therefore think it is important in our ongoing work for us to emphasise that we have a shared responsibility – a shared responsibility for the budget and for budgetary problems, which means that we also have a shared responsibility for finding solutions. We need to take the lessons learned from this year’s discharge procedure and use them in the designing of the new programmes that we are working on right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to appeal to the Court of Auditors to specify very precisely what we are talking about when debating in Parliament, because even in this Chamber, different kinds of numbers are being bandied about which are quite alarming. It needs to be said very clearly when we are talking about the lower error limit, when we are talking about the upper error limit, when we are talking about the most likely rate of error and when we are talking about the frequency of occurrence of errors, because public debate has already got the idea that the usual suspect – cohesion policy – has a 49% error rate, whereas this refers to frequency. I appeal to the Court, particularly during debate in Parliament, to specify exactly what we are talking about, because if we do not make this clear, it will lead to a great many misunderstandings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed the case that when we read the materials, the extent of these irregularities is not in fact completely clear. So I decided to make a somewhat different type of analysis. Well, if we assume the extent of these irregularities in a policy group in which problems are increasing – I am thinking here of cohesion, energy and transport – comes to 7.7%, and we convert this into actual amounts, we have the following situation: a sum of EUR 41 billion has been spent on this, which means that the irregularities come to EUR 3 billion. This is, of course, EUR 3 billion too much. I would appeal for us however to give consideration to whether the methods for combating this problem are effective ones. This is because if, in spite of these efforts, the situation is deteriorating slightly year-on-year, it can be said that these methods are not very effective. However, let us remember that this is not everything, it is not even half – it is something of minor importance. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So all the programmes were triggered and yet, despite this fact, the level of error in 2010, although it increased in comparison to 2009 – to 7.7% as some of you rightly pointed out – is nevertheless much lower than in 2008 or 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think this also demonstrates that the systems which were developed in this programming period are working. Of course, implementation of those systems requires more efforts at the level of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you – or many of you – also discussed the issue of financial engineering instruments and we do, of course, take into account the risks related to these financial engineering instruments, but I think that it is also very important to take into account that these instruments are the source of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises which are so important in the situation of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission actually adopted a very exhaustive guidance note on the implementation of financial engineering instruments. We developed a new and very comprehensive audit methodology for financial engineering instruments and we also strongly advise audit authorities in the Member States to produce thematic audits on the use of financial engineering instruments. All this demonstrates that we take this issue very seriously into account, but of course we will be ready during the discharge procedure to discuss this issue in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is undertaking follow-up, as we speak, to the issues identified in the 2009 discharge resolution and to the new findings disclosed in the 2010 Court report.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, major proposals for the next multiannual financial framework have been tabled already, notably for cohesion and agriculture policies. You will find in these proposals how the Commission has duly taken your recommendations into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals will follow until the end of this year and will include as well the necessary provisions to improve further the financial management of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to a constructive and fruitful debate with you and I would also like to assure you that the Commission will provide you with all necessary support as it has done in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of all those who work there, my deepest thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are indeed committed to continue further cooperation with this House, with the relevant committee, the Budgetary Control Committee, and with all the committees – covering agriculture, regional development, or any other area – which find that our work is of relevance for the discharge of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This annual report provides this Chamber with more detailed information. We have provided you with quantifiable indicators that might prove confusing to a non-expert reader. But we explain clearly that this offers you a kind of thermometer whereby you can compare a series of areas which are most likely to affect, and have a financial impact on, the payments underlying the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see the evolution since 2006 and we will be able to see how the situation develops after 2010; that will be, one might say, the thermometer that we can use to see what the temperature is. But more importantly, I think, we have been able to indicate to you where the problems are and where the roots and the causes of those problems lie, so that you, as legislators, you as the discharge authority, the Council and the Commission, can take your own responsibilities to ensure that the rules are indeed implemented by all those responsible in the Commission and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot forget that the budget is implemented by the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States. So we need to fully implement current legal frameworks but we also say that we need to simplify. I believe that the future reforms to the next financial framework envisaged by the Commission proposals offer a golden opportunity to redress the problems we face.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there is a focus to be put on the results to be achieved in terms of the added value we want to get from funding from the European Union budget. It must not be forgotten that we have to comply with rules, but we want more than that: we want the funds to be effectively used in the most economic way and in an efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have talked about the complexity and bureaucracy of the systems in place. The new financial period may eventually benefit from simple rules and more effective mechanisms, but minimising the costs of control cannot lead to there being no adequate accountability from those responsible, either in Member States or in the Commission; the mechanisms must be sufficiently transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Be sure that the European Court of Auditors is working according to the Treaty provisions to issue its own opinions on the proposals that have been put forward by the Commission to change the regulations in agriculture and in the Structural Funds. We believe that these principles of transparency and accountability should be key, should guide all these reforms, and also should be applied to other areas that are outside the budget of the European Union. We have a lot of new interinstitutional instruments where a lot of public funds are committed, and we need to ensure that there is sufficient accountability and public audit. I think you have a good example with the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make two remarks on concrete questions raised by Members of this House. Let me reassure Ms Macovei that the report on the agencies has already been delivered for all the agencies and that the horizontal issues to which she referred will be delivered in due course. She is absent, but I believe the message will get to her.</p>
<p class="contents">A word to Mr Audy. We are indeed very committed to working with the national audit institutions. In this annual report, we have worked together with the national audit institution of the Netherlands and with the national audit institution of the Czech Republic on a pilot study where we could work together. The results of that work underlie our conclusions on agriculture. This is an experience we have to assess, so as to measure the advantages and the disadvantages, the costs and benefits, but it is for sure the way we have to go, because we need to have a single concept for auditing the Union budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The error rate has even increased compared to the previous year. It says a lot about how, in a large number of cases, the rules on spending have been flouted. It may have to do with contravention of the rules on public procurement or the notification of unjustified or wrongly estimated costs of aid. The role of the Member States in this is absolutely crucial, because they could prevent, discover and correct errors. This is about significant sums of money, because cohesion policy is, after agricultural policy, the second largest item of expenditure in the EU budget. It represents a third of the budget – around EUR 350 billion in this current Structural Funds period. The EU must apply sanctions more readily and more purposefully, so that abuses and errors can be brought to an end. Sanctions would include suspension of payments, the freezing of assets and the recovery of funds paid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This notion is all the more important in the difficult period we are going through, during which we have a duty to be particularly vigilant regarding how we manage public money, by complying with the Financial Regulation, but even more so, by committing to use European contributions in the most efficient way possible. Concerning the Court of Auditors’ special reports for agencies and joint undertakings, I am, on the contrary, disappointed with the information that is becoming increasingly incomplete over the years. These decentralised agencies, present in various Member States, deserve, on the contrary, particular attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
