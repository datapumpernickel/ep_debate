It aims to contribute to a resolution of the ongoing conflict, along with other international partners, and in close collaboration with the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the difficult circumstances in which the business communities are currently working in the Middle East region. At the same time, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and therefore the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm then that in applying the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the EU relies on international law for the territorial definition of the State of Israel, thus excluding the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Therefore, products originating in these areas are not entitled to benefit from preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Following confirmation from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal of the European Union in November 2001, in order to inform them of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the provisions of the bilateral agreement, it is the responsibility of the customs administrations of the EU Member States to check the origin of goods with the Israeli authorities through the post-verification procedure. It is also their responsibility to take the necessary precautions where a customs debt is due. It is in this context that the recovery of duties is now undertaken by the customs administrations of the Member States. These measures, initiated by the Commission, aim to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I can only reiterate that the Commission has always declared its willingness to cooperate and examine any technical proposal from the Israeli authorities to find a solution for this issue which would respect the terms of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, one can conclude that the Commission has taken the necessary measures to ensure correct application of Community law. As a result, Member States are imposing duties on products from the settlements. We keep this regularly under review with Member States' customs authorities and we are also continuing to talk to Israel about technical issues related to customs certificates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East. Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers, I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law, making the resolution of that problem even more intractable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process. Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that, unfortunately, such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States. The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake. No one summed up the implications better than Commissioner Patten himself in a debate in this House in May 2001. It is important to put it on record again, and I quote him: 'The European Union's position on settlements is clear: all settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace. The Commission communication (of 1998) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights 'contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law'.' That says it in a nutshell.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said. The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today. One does not get the impression that this issue has been pursued vigorously enough by the Commission as a whole nor, indeed, by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said with regard to Israel that at the moment at best it is not being as cooperative as it could be in providing full details on the origin of all products and their component parts to customs authorities. At worst, it could be said that Israel is defying its trade agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten, to some extent echoed today, we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action. Therefore, while I welcome what the Commissioner has said, I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Rossa (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the cavalier attitude the Israeli authorities display towards their obligations to comply with international law with regard to their trade relations with European Union is an indicative example of its attitude to international law in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the European Union is so weak in exerting its pressure on Israel to comply with international law is reflected in the fact that new agreements have been made with Israel in recent times. I would like to touch on those.</p>
<p class="contents">I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana, on behalf of the European Union, to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations, but the European Union is undermining his efforts, in my view, by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended. The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement. Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel's compliance with human rights provisions, nothing tangible has been done, to my knowledge. Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements, and these are for export to Community markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products. This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement, while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community's political will to maintain this position is not convincing to Israel and certainly not convincing to me and many others in this House, while it fails to ensure the correct implementation of the existing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government. In the economic sphere two things need to happen: steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports. Both these steps require the political will of a united Commission. I am not convinced that the Commission is united on this matter and the consent of the Member States is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that in making these comments I acknowledge that the responsibility to make peace is shared with the Palestinian leadership. It must ensure that all possible steps are taken to end the vicious suicide bombings that have caused so much Israeli anguish and hardship and have hardened attitudes behind an irresponsible Israeli Government. Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address two points made by the Commissioner. He said that Member States are applying duties on settlement goods. My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods, and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the post-delivery verification system, once Israel declares where the goods come from, there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No other explanation can justify the proofs of origin being issued to both manufactured and agricultural products – produced in settlements – which we consider illegal and therefore not covered by the agreement. These include chives, non-woven textiles, wine, snack foods and so on. Although they are given customs access by the EU, they are actually produced in West Bank settlements such as Barkan, the Golan Heights settlement of Katzrin and the Gaza Strip settlement of Gush Katif.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new issue. We know that the Member States are unable to reliably distinguish which consignments are eligible and which are not. We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and exporters, and is trying to expand the list. We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify, when shipments are presented for clearance, what products they contain.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation cannot continue for two reasons. Firstly, Liberals attach great importance to rules; here we are seeing a consistent, persistent breaking of the rules. We recognise there are difficulties. The Commission and the Member States bear separate and full responsibility for this, since they both have obligations to act to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that those in the Commission who want to discharge their guardianship responsibility have insufficient political support within the Commission. The Member States that want to help have insufficient support in the Council. That is why this Parliament and the Member State parliaments need to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it is the duty of the government of Israel not to play tricks with a signed agreement. Israel should understand that this is not the time to do that. Unless they respect the clauses of the Association Agreement, the Israelis will have difficulty in convincing the rest of the world that they are acting in good faith in issues such as the peace process as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, therefore, just like to ask myself – and you – some questions. I wonder, firstly, whether the European Union’s efforts to pursue political dialogue and the participation of the quartet will be strengthened or weakened by the genuine reluctance on the part of the Commission to ensure that the protocol on origin rules and the territorial clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are enforced correctly. I am raising this point as I believe that it is fundamental. We have been debating this issue for years and there is no doubt that progress has been made, yet we are, once again, facing a blatant violation of this agreement. There are enormous obstacles to the peace process which, in my opinion, are due, firstly, to the policy of the Israeli Government, which is continuing with its settlements, following a policy of annexation and erecting walls. These obstacles are also, however, the result of the increasing violations of fundamental principles and the rules of international humanitarian law in Israel and Palestine. I believe that we should not give aid that allows agreements concluded not to be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to consider the reasons why Israel is violating the agreement, Article 2 of which calls upon Israel, and us, to respect it. We are responsible for ensuring that, on the basis of the agreement, our relations are founded on the respect for human rights and not on the violation of international humanitarian law. I believe that a politically appropriate, measured response from the Union to Israel’s persistence in issuing certificates of origin for products from the settlements should ensure that no product can continue to be given preferential treatment as an import into the European Union. If we give due weight to the statements of the Commission regarding preferential treatment of products imported from the settlements, then we see that Israel’s practice of issuing certificates of origin for these products is considered by the Commission to be a violation of the agreement. Nevertheless, this practice still continues. The agreement – the Commission has said so too – is not being enforced resolutely. I would like this issue of relations and legality to be addressed, because we need to end the situation of ‘anything goes’ that exists in Palestine and Israel. Israel needs to learn to enforce the agreements that it signs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, the Commission has communicated on a number of occasions that the European Union does not accept Israel's illegal occupation policy. The Commission has also taken every opportunity to denounce the illegal application of the Association Agreement. A number of weeks ago, we received a response from Commissioner Patten to the effect that 'the Member States have informed the Commission that in a number of cases, import duties have been levied on goods that originated from the settlements and were imported with Israeli proofs of origin.' This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place. This is unacceptable. The Association Agreement with Israel has been drafted and must be observed with due regard to international law and to fundamental values. If you make sound agreements, you make your friends, provided these agreements are observed correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that they meet all the conditions of the origin rules protocol. Commissioner, do you subscribe to this conclusion for the other EU Member States too?

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly explain that I am one of the signatories of this question; I did so as a democratic service for Mrs Sandbaek who asked me to do so. I do not agree with the opinion of the majority of the speakers but this question has been around for a long time in this House and it was important to clear the air and see clearly in this history of enforcement. Indeed, it is the question of the application of the Agreement and not of challenging it that is in the question from Mrs Morgantini and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The response from the Commissioner was very precise, completed further by the important clarifications given by Mr Belder. The Commissioner indicated that the application came from the customs authorities of the Member States. Mr Belder gave a very precise example of a Member State, which considers that this Agreement is being applied. Furthermore, there are appeal proceedings, which is the association council. If you have accurate details, Mrs Morgantini, you can communicate them to the Commission, who will not fail, I am sure, to mention them for the next Association Agreement. The rest are words and threats, which are founded on nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am slightly worried, Mr de Rossa, that you are using this occasion to challenge the Association Agreement with Israel, because that is not the aim of this debate at all. I am also astonished that you want the US to put pressure on Israel to respect human rights more, whilst you do not mention the pressure that the European Union could and should exert on the Palestinian Authority to stop the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We all heard Mr Arafat lamenting the current situation and transferring all the blame onto Israel, forgetting once again the fatal attacks of recent weeks. Now we all know the role that Hamas plays.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, just like the European Parliament, could give its support to Mr Mazen through budgetary aids or parliamentary incentives. Mr Mazen seems to show a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement. We can back him instead of continuing to back those who, like Mr Arafat, think that the terrorist attacks are part of normal policy in Palestine on its romantic road to freedom. What freedom? That, I will leave you to imagine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the legal point of view, on the one hand, it is quite clear that <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> – treaties under international law are to be adhered to. We know which territory is internationally recognised as being Israel’s, we know which areas are occupied; we also know that products from Israel can be imported and that produce from the areas occupied by it cannot be.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, gathering evidence is very difficult; so, in practice, is knowing where to draw the line. The Commission’s answer has this to say on the subject: ‘These principles do not apply to products which have been sufficiently processed within Israel's internationally recognized borders.’</p>
<p class="contents">Does that, then, mean in practice that oranges harvested on the West Bank are processed in Israel, the juice bottled and exported to the EU? Is that what is meant by ‘sufficiently processed’? Or is it ‘sufficiently processed’ only if the juice is blended with that of apples and bananas in a mixed fruit cordial with the orange juice making up less than 50%? I think this shows us how difficult it is in practice to draw a distinction, even where the proportions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in this context, we should ask ourselves the important question as to whom this is meant to benefit. Does it do the Palestinians any good when an Israeli orchard, or a factory on the West Bank, is closed down? The workers there are laid off, and then the same production operation restarts in the Israeli heartland with immigrants from Russia. This, of course, does the Palestinians no good at all, but at least the position is clear-cut in legal terms. We have then maintained the legal position, but we have not necessarily helped the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ensure that the actions of the Commission or of the European Union do not make overall relations between Israel and the Palestinians worse than they already are. I am therefore in favour of the Commission continuing to act in these matters with the same caution and conscientiousness that it has demonstrated so far, never losing sight of the overall framework within which relations between Israel and the Palestinians are developing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In substance the reply said that the Commission believed that the development of relations with Israel would make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process. You have said more or less the same thing to us today, Mr Nielson. Although I share the idea that knowledge and an exchange of knowledge help build a better world, in the same ways as economic cooperation, I am particularly stupefied by this answer. Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament’s Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate. We all know that in paragraph 8 of the Resolution, Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to urgently convene the association council to give its position to the Israeli Government, by asking the latter to respect the UN resolutions, and, in this context, called for the suspension of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we, a year and a half after this demand was worded? When the Agreement began in 1995, just after the process in Oslo, some regarded it as helping to build peace. The situation now, however, is radically different. What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about? Partnerships can only be devised on the basis of mutual trust, and of shared rights and obligations. Now, the criminal attitude of the Israeli Government shows every day that it not only flouts the concerns of the Union, but also that it outbids the other in this fatal situation. More than a year ago now, Israel erected a wall in the West Bank allegedly for reasons of safety. In actual fact, it is an iron curtain that massacres the Palestinian territories and drives tens of thousands of inhabitants in their homes. In this way, new territories are being annexed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to give Parliaments’ Resolution tangible form. There are precedents. In 1990 the Commission enforced Parliament’s recommendation that scientific cooperation be partially frozen until the Palestinian schools and universities that had been closed unilaterally by the Israeli authorities were completely reopened and remained so. It was at least a few months before it was possible for them to reopen. Today, given that the clause on the respect of fundamental rights has been brutally violated, and in the sight of the whole world, in what way is this demand for suspension excessive?</p>
<p class="contents">In what way is it excessive to ask that this law is applied and respected?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I conclude Mr President, I am aware that the responsibility of the Council, shamefully absent today, is enormous. As, in theory, a member of the quartet, the Union has the means to carry weight. What it lacks is the political will to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commissioner also knows that once Israel has said that a product hails from Israel, there is very little customs offices can do about this, even when we know that we are being led up the garden path. Member States are not individually capable of enforcing what, in my view, is to be done, namely for Israel to stop labelling products which we know originate from settlements, but which are still given the label 'from Israel'. How difficult this is was once again demonstrated in this very Parliament when the Israeli Ambassador stated quite clearly that he challenges the EU's right to draw a distinction between products from Israel and those from the settlements. As long as this situation persists, I do not think it is up to the Member States, but up to the Commission, to do battle with the Israeli Government in order to force the latter into action, which Member States are not capable of doing. It is also up to the Commission to draw the necessary conclusions if Israel does not appear prepared to do what it is required according to EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, now it is being used as a political instrument to bash Israel and the settlements. The author of the oral question has gone as far as calling for the suspension of the more recent 1995 agreement, even though the Commission has controversially agreed with her and imposed tariffs on goods allegedly exported by the settlements in the Occupied Territories. This is a technical dispute on trade and, although I am a friend of Israel, I support an eventual two-state solution and a dismantling of most of the settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestine is not yet a state competent to have its own trade agreements, which, controversially, the EU ratified in 1994. The Commission did this in spite of the fact that Israel had the signed agreement of the Palestinian Authority that Israel was responsible for customs matters for goods exported from the settlements. Nevertheless, there is also an EU-Palestine Free Trade Agreement. Therefore, whichever way you look at it, these goods should have EU tariff-free access as they come from territories covered by one or other free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">All trade agreements refer to the territory where the goods are produced, not the nationality or the religion of the producers. This whole dispute is now subject to a technical resolution under Article 79 of the Association Agreement, which is where it rightfully belongs. It should not be the subject of political manipulation within this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is engendering further hostility to trade with Israel and undermines Israel's faith in the impartiality of the EU as a vital component of the quartet in the quest for the Roadmap for Peace and the end of terrorism.

Now, eighteen months later, this Resolution is still being ignored. Could we see this as unwavering support for the Israeli state’s policy despite its violations of human rights and international law?</p>
<p class="contents">We could, for we are talking about economic, commercial agreements, about financial interests, but we also about the right to life. This colonial war claims more and more victims. Even though the roadmap made provision to colonisation to be put on ice, the Jewish colonies continue to grow and roads around them are still being built. In Israel the situation is tragic. The discrimination against some Israeli citizens is increasing; they are persecuted, denied certain rights because they are Arab Israelis. The Knesset enacted a law to prevent Palestinians from obtaining Israeli citizenship by marriage. This is a discriminatory and racist law. A recent report by FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights, has revealed to us a modern form of slavery of migrant workers. Even Mr Abraham Burg, a former President of the Knesset, raised the alarm. He said that Israel is a framework of corruption, based on foundations of oppression and injustice, which reduces itself to a colonist state, headed by a clique of individuals who are without morals, are above the law and corrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">In the occupied territories the situation is tragic. A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice, and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy. We are not, of course, going to count the deaths. Who are the victims of terrorism though, of this State terrorism that assassinates refugees on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I will say that we cannot remain silent. Is it not our duty to put pressure on the Israeli Government, with all the means that we have at our disposal including economic and commercial ones? Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this Parliamentary question is inappropriate and imprudent. We are in the midst of a peace process, the European Union is a member of the Quartet, and I believe that if we in the European Parliament and in the other institutions really feel solidarity with the Executive and with the figure of Mr Solana in his capacity as ‘Mr Common Foreign and Security Policy’, our representative, then we should support a rapprochement between the countries and not seek conflict between the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, furthermore, that this question implies a direct condemnation of the occupied territories. All of us in Parliament have done this before now: it is a commonly-accepted practice, and we also know that, in accordance with the Taba agreements on the devolution of the territories, many of those territories, which were once desert and will now be habitable, will pass into Palestinian hands.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me most is that this speech goes against the Palestinian Authority. Since Arafat and Abu Mazen are making constant demands for Europe to take a firmer stance in the peace process, and for that process not to remain in the hands of the United States, and if, as Mr Solana says, Europe really is one of the biggest contributors to Abu Mazen’s profile, why do we not, instead of creating divisions between the parties, devote ourselves to upholding Abu Mazen and his policies, to upholding the prestige of the European Union against the other side?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it does the peace process no favours for one of the parties involved to pick a fight with one of the other negotiators. Why are we not asking Mr Solana and the Palestinian Authority to strengthen the administration of the latter, and helping them both to achieve that aim? Why are we not demanding, and why is Europe not showing greater support for, public health and education services? That would prevent education from remaining to a large extent in the hands of a group like Hamas, which has been condemned for acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we not making a real contribution to strengthening the Palestinian Authority? That would be the answer. I would like to know what impact this question will have, since it will probably go against many Palestinian workers in the occupied territories. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the only possible approach and does not prevent the EU from presenting its own opinions and objectives within the framework of global partnership. In practice these are complex situations. What is more important is to understand the ordinary basic mechanisms which either hamper or encourage stability, just as Mr Schuman did when he put forward his brilliant genesis of an idea for the Communities that served as a basis for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would in this connection like to highlight one basic mechanism that has an effect on stability and peace: a clean environment. Clean water, as was shown in Jordan recently, is a vital necessity, and to attain it all the countries in the West Bank region must find a solution both separately and together. Unfortunately, the international community is still not even aware of the environmental destruction which is a reality in the West Bank. Excessive water extraction, conducting untreated waste water to Jordan, and the uncontrolled dumping of community waste have led to unthinkable health risks and a shortage of water.</p>
<p class="contents">The West Bank environment project is a multicultural and multilateral project which aims to solve major problems threatening the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the region. The project is not, however, making adequate progress. The reason is not low levels of finance or a lack of know-how and technology. The reason is chiefly that, for a project which is under way in a region occupied by three countries, there exists no political forum to agree on practical matters that are essential for its implementation, even though all the parties involved are agreed in principle on the needs and the measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">One may without exaggeration say that the EU is at present the only player in the world that could offer a political forum for attempts like the West Bank environment project to build stability and peace through action on the part of the inhabitants of the region. A neutral mediator is needed to initiate decision-making that overrides political controversies. If it were not for examples of voluntary action like the West Bank environment project, all the other work the EU does to implement the Middle East peace plans would be in vain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint. In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984, yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion. But, as several speakers have already said, we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country.</p>
<p class="contents">I have visited Gaza, because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN, and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now, when the borders are closed, Palestinian produce cannot move out of the Gaza Strip. I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city, where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe. There is a wonderful climate. It is potentially a great source of economic value to the Palestinian people, but every time there was trouble the borders were shut down and the produce was simply left to rot on the streets of Gaza. That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements – and that is a very real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the Israeli authorities have the means to eliminate the substantial distortions of the origin rules involving settlement products without causing further inconvenience to the EU, the Member States, Community operators and Israeli exporters. Perhaps without Israel's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU, short of suspending the agreement, is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I share the view that it was quite some time before the EU got to the point where these rules were being clearly applied. But we have been doing this for some time now and this fact needs to be clarified. I would also add that the political need for discussion and energy to be injected into the subject has more to do with what to do now than with the starting-point of the discussion which related to the actual administration of the customs regime.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Commission I do not recognise anything in our discussions or handling of this in the Commission that resembles what some have said here about questioning the unity of the Commission in relation to this issue. This has never been a divisive issue inside the Commission. Others have mentioned that Member States have to agree. That is absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbæk asked why the Commission has not officially informed Member States about this and what it is going to do. I will repeat what I said in my first contribution to this debate, namely that following the confirmation received from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal in November 2001 in order to inform them of the situation. So almost two years ago the Commission did what Mrs Sandbæk asked. This is one element on which I based my first remarks. It sounds as if this debate is about a war that was waged some time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In February this year – which was the time that the last internal Member States customs authorities met on this issue – about EUR 100 000 had been collected as permanent duties on these product categories from the beginning of 2003. We expect new figures to be available at the end of this month when the next meeting takes place. The amount of guarantees taken on these products by EU customs authorities at that time was as much as EUR 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are certain that the goods are coming from settlements, duties are applied immediately by Member States. Where there is any doubt, or where there is unclear or insufficient information about this from the Israeli authorities, we also apply duties after having checked as far as we can. This is being regularly reviewed within our Member States through the Customs Committee, which will meet again at the end of this month. This is something which is not just handled by putting a notice in the Official Journal; it is an active, ongoing process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Gahler asked about the modalities and principles of assessing the accumulation, and how much processing is necessary before it becomes an Israeli product. This is not the only place in the world where we have to decide on these matters. We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided. There is no special rule for Israel on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
