<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, naturally, my colleagues and I in the Commission — particularly President Barroso and Commissioner Andor — share your concern regarding the situation of the homeless in Europe during this spell of cold weather.</p>
<p class="contents">No one could remain unmoved by the situation of people sleeping rough on extremely cold nights and, even more tragically, by the death of many people all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You therefore have every right to wonder what is being done to remedy this situation and that is what we can do together faced with what is one of the most extreme and most unacceptable manifestations of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the main actors involved in the fight to improve the situation of the homeless …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President called for silence in the Chamber)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President. I was saying that, as we all know, the main actors involved in the situation of the homeless and housing exclusion are the Member States and local actors. Here in Strasbourg, like in other EU cities, local and regional authorities and non-governmental organisations respond to the situation by offering emergency shelter. Local authorities and civil society everywhere are taking the initiative and joining forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion calls on the Member States to develop and further the development of national, regional or sometimes local action plans to tackle the problem of the homeless, and identifies the areas where action is needed. It is literally vital that the Member States continue in this effort. They are well aware of that and are acting accordingly. I believe that it is very important for Parliament to remind them of this demand by including this urgent debate in the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union’s capacity for direct action may be limited, we too have a role to play. Firstly, we must remind the Member States of their responsibilities and support them in their efforts. In the longer term, we must improve our understanding of the problems, particularly by improving our instruments for measuring the scale of this phenomenon, which will then make us better able to act.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, through the PROGRESS programme the European Union is helping to fund a new study on the links between the homeless and migration and is supporting the European Federation of National Organisations working with the Homeless. Furthermore, the Commission is proposing that the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund should respond more efficiently and in a more targeted way to the issue of housing for the homeless in the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">European funds must also be used to evaluate and test operational solutions and research new approaches through work on social innovation. We are thinking about housing policy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Commissioner Andor, presented an innovative approach that was launched by railway companies and set in stone, for example, by the European Charter for the development of social and societal innovation in train stations. Thus, the railway companies which are signatories to this Charter declared their intention to share their action programmes in order to contribute to raising corporate awareness of extreme social inclusion at European level. This work has received support from the European initiative for social innovation and experimentation through funding for the recently completed ‘Hope in Stations’ project, which will be extended by the ‘Work in Stations’ project. We want to welcome the establishment of this Charter, which is a positive step at the very time when, as we know, other methods of withdrawal or even stigmatisation are being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter and its ethics illustrate the Commission’s vision of action in the economic and social area. This is a broad vision of social needs, which should take into account the added value and responsibility of all the agreements by the actors and, in particular, the associations and non-governmental organisations which play an exemplary role. Day by day we, the companies, governments, regional and local authorities and civil society representatives are each in our own way giving shape to this social Europe. We are being called up for the battle, which today calls for solidarity with the homeless, as your debate shows.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken action but there is still much to be done. The Commission, for its part, is looking to provide the greatest possible support from the Union for the Member States’ efforts on this issue of the homeless. We are relying particularly on Parliament’s work as laid out in its resolution of 14 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, honourable Members, with the initiative for social entrepreneurship, which was published in October and which I, for my part, have been following very closely, the Commission proposed new tools, which should allow social enterprises to better carry out their mission and we know that some of these social enterprises are involved with the homeless, especially when they aim to respond to the needs of vulnerable people, as is the case of the homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to cite three examples: better signposting of Structural Funds, simplified rules and fewer controls on State aid intended for social services for vulnerable people and, lastly, public contract rules which lessen obligations for social services and allow certain markets to be more easily preserved or reserved for start-up companies.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I can say on behalf of Commissioner Andor and I thank you, Mr President, honourable Members, for turning your attention to this issue, which is extremely serious at this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, while these winter deaths are today provoking strong reactions in public opinion, we are well aware that in summer too there are just as many if not more victims of this unacceptable insecurity. For, yes, the cold kills. Yet, aside from the cold, the economic crisis, poverty and insecurity are killing the most excluded people.</p>
<p class="contents">There are over three million homeless people in the EU, and these include not only the traditional figures of the very marginalised but also more and more senior citizens, young people, women and families. Sometimes there are workers among the homeless. Let us remember that, in times of economic crisis, the fall into extreme insecurity can happen very quickly. A family breakdown or a redundancy can be all it takes for a family, who until then had been coping, to be thrown onto the streets. Moreover, being homeless can cover a number of situations which must also be understood. These are all the people who sleep in their cars, in hotels or those who are temporarily able to stay with a friend or relative.</p>
<p class="contents">We must change our collective view of homelessness as this issue covers a wide range of people and situations. They all call for a comprehensive, fast and strong political response. We must act, not only to alleviate the emergency, but especially in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">If recovering from the crisis is the main objective, providing the homeless with emergency provisions and the means to come off the streets will help towards this. For it is obvious that, without permanent access to affordable housing, the homeless find themselves excluded from various other rights and services. Indignation at this situation, as well as an analysis of it, will be shared without difficulty. Let us move on once and for all to the next stage: political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Parliament has already asked you several times to put in place a true European strategy against homelessness. I am referring to the 2010 written declaration and the resolution by our colleagues Mr Berès and Ms Delli adopted here in September 2011 with a view to putting an end to homelessness by 2015. This was also the ambitious integrated European strategy that we were waiting for. I am also referring to the resolution by Mr Daerden in November on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Members of the European Parliament have already asked you three times to put in place this strategy for the homeless, which was articulated around specific objectives which I do not have the time to repeat again here. Where are we with this road jmap? When is the Commission going to demand real national strategies accompanied by real means from the Member States? What amount of ESF and ERDF money could be mobilised? Today, our fear is that the European platform against poverty and social exclusion will remain a mere declaration of intent. Just like that of the same name in 2010, which, unfortunately, will not have delivered many concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">The political objectives and priorities of the EU brought together in the Europe 2020 strategy are undergoing inclusive growth. Yet how are we to build true social cohesion if we do not fight against these situations of extreme insecurity? This is an issue which cannot be delegated to the goodwill and limited means of associations and local communities. It is no longer acceptable that, in times of crisis, the European Union appears only as an instigator of austerity plans that push people onto the streets both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be easy to accuse the EU of wanting to save only the banks while abandoning the people, but I refuse to do so. Here we have the perfect opportunity to fight against this caricature. We must seize this opportunity and not be content with mere declarations of intent. There is little point in claiming to be fiercely opposed to the situation of the homeless. It is easy to be indignant about such an issue. There is, however, a great deal to be done and that is why we are asking once again for concrete voluntary action in favour of homeless people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is this headed?</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react …</p>

<p class="contents">We currently have approximately 3 million people who have no fixed abode in Europe. I find that in my own Member State, the United Kingdom, hypothermia cases amongst the elderly have doubled in the last five years. Such is the extent of the problem that it was no surprise to me today when I picked up a leading newspaper in the United Kingdom and the headline was: ‘Frozen to death as fuel bills soar’.</p>
<p class="contents">Some may argue that this is about homeless people. Well, yes it is, but my argument is that, whilst we should have a strategy in order to deal with the homeless situation and those people affected by the severe weather who are homeless, we must, equally, have a measure in place to deal with those people who could find themselves in a situation of homelessness through not being able to afford a place to live, in view of the current pressures that they have financially.</p>
<p class="contents">We are finding, right across the European Union, that redundancies are rising and repossessions are rising. I have a figure of 233 homeless people dead within the last seven days. Mr Daul quotes a figure in excess of 600 over the past few weeks. This is a matter of real and great shame for all of us.</p>

The policies of the Member States and of the European Union have failed across the board where this issue is concerned. More than 600 people have died so far during the spell of cold weather that is moving across the whole of Europe. There have been over 80 deaths in Poland, more than 130 in Ukraine, hundreds have died in Russia, and the first victims have also been claimed in Germany. Most of the people who freeze to death or are taken to hospital severely ill from the cold are homeless people; people who, for one reason or another, are living on the streets. They are freezing to death in the open air, under bridges, in parks, in side streets, but increasingly also in unheated homes. With the huge increases in energy costs – for heating oil, for example – they may have been unable to pay their energy bills, or their heating may be antiquated or may have failed completely. All the Member States have an obligation to implement urgent immediate measures to save people who have no protection from the cold. Local and regional authorities need to be supported in their efforts to provide the necessary assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it appalling that, at the moment, no one can say exactly how many homeless people there are at present in the European Union; how many people are at risk of freezing to death. Within the European Union there are no common indicators, no statistics clarifying the actual extent of the problem – not even in Germany. We call for a task force to be set up at the European Commission to shed a clear light on those in urgent need, on those who are particularly affected in the individual regions, so that immediate assistance can also be organised. We call for uniform statistics across the EU; indicators that can provide a complete, differentiated picture of the extent of homelessness and tell us the different population groups affected. The Member States must arrange for legislation to be passed to this effect. We also call for EU-wide programmes to be set up for the modernisation of home energy. The possibilities for this under the Structural Funds need to be broadened considerably. We also propose a debate on EU-wide social and ecological minimum standards to combat poverty, housing shortages and energy poverty.</p>

That is why I will say it again, on behalf of the European Commission, that it is good, that it is normal and that it is necessary for Parliament and the Commission, which is entering into dialogue with you, to take stock of this situation and respond to it in a number of ways.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say — this is not necessarily a good answer, Ms Guillaume — that, as you know, the main responsibility lies with the Member States. The first requirement of a debate such as this one is that we act in conjunction with the Member States so that they assume this responsibility both in their own countries and throughout the EU and that is the role of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul mentioned the debate in which we participated, along with my colleague Dacian Cioloş, on the food aid programme. Why have we been deadlocked on this programme, which directly concerns support for the most fragile people through so many of the associations to which Mr Daul rightly paid tribute and which are not all very large associations but local associations which do excellent work?</p>
<p class="contents">What is it that we are coming up against, honourable Members? We are coming up against some Member States’ feelings or their understanding of national competences, indeed sometimes regional competences, saying that it is not up to Brussels to worry about the action programme or food aid. Thanks to your determination and thanks to the work of my colleague Mr Cioloş, we have managed to convince the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Ms Guillaume, I recognise that it is not an ideal response to refer back to national competences. We have the ability … Mr Karim just this minute, Mr Daul and Ms Zimmer mentioned an issue which interests me and which I feel committed about and it is what I call ‘universal services’: basic services for people, be they related to housing, food or energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can indirectly act in this area by using its laws and regulations to promote the actions of those who are on to the ground and the men and women who are suffering. I would like to give you one or two examples in which I was personally involved. I presented you with the overhaul of the rules governing public procurement, which is now being debated in your committees, and my colleague Mr Almunia and I revised the rules governing State aid and, if you look closely at these texts, which have been under discussion in Parliament and in the Council for several weeks, you will find very specific measures for promoting social inclusion and basic social services through public procurement and facilitating social services through State aid. This is another way in which the European Union can make itself useful and play its part.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Guillaume and Ms Delli mentioned the strategy for the homeless that you had been calling for so earnestly throughout this conference and the September 2011 resolution. I also said, in response to Mr Rinaldi, that the Commission — and this is a message that Mr Andor asked me to deliver to you — has taken a number of measures and taken into consideration a number of recommendations made by you. These include a study on mobility, migration, expropriations, a transnational project on housing strategies which will be supported within the framework of the work on social innovation, earmarking European Funds, as I mentioned, specifically for housing with the European Regional Development Fund or other social funds. The figures I have seen are only figures but they are quite clear: the Member States dedicated EUR 10 billion from the European Social Fund for the 2007–2013 period to tackling social exclusion in aid of the most deprived and most vulnerable people.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to tell Ms Delli that we share her feelings regarding what is happening with the unacceptable criminalisation of the homeless in some Member States. We have seen attacks against the homeless in other Member States and we, alongside you, are calling on the Member States to accept their responsibilities to put an end to such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to tell Mr Daul that I have taken note of his call for European civil protection. This is an issue — as he knows — which is very important to me. My colleague, Ms Georgieva, is very involved in this issue. We have made concrete proposals to arrive at what I hope will one day be a European civil protection force to respond to disasters outside the EU, but also, Mr Daul, to act as needed when all European countries are affected by problems which impact on the most vulnerable people and which put the health or safety of some of our fellow citizens in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is good that the European Parliament has, even briefly, acted on its own initiative, together with the Commission, to address this situation with our legal, financial and political tools. I believe that, in the serious crisis that we are currently experiencing — and this is one of the reasons why there are so many homeless people on the streets at the moment, due to unemployment, as Ms Guillaume rightly said — there is a European dimension to this issue even though the competences are not necessarily European. That is why, in its own place and with the means available to it, such as the ability to drive through legislation and mobilise funds, Parliament, and with it the European Commission, will continue to give a legitimate, justified European dimension to the issue of the homeless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
