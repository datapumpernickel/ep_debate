<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I had to point here and now to two complex issues in the economic field, I would no doubt choose the following: the consolidation of the financial markets and the approximation of the direct taxation regulations – specifically tax on savings – which is under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds, which we will hear shortly, demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues. These two issues, the liberalisation of the financial services market and taxation, are dealt with in the action plan which is the subject of my report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the Commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the European Parliament in the implementation of this plan, and we will not disregard our duties, but exercise them responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">The complexity of the action plan also reflects the ambitious nature of the report presented by the Commission, which contains 43 measures and involves all the sectors in the field (stock exchanges, banks, investment funds, insurance, etc.) and which applies to what has come to be called the ‘new economy’, which is – according to the Lisbon Summit – one of the elements which will help to put an end to unemployment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is included in these measures? What is intended through these measures? In my judgement, to sum up, it is the following: the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market. In the explanatory statement, I offer a detailed comparison of the two types of market.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these two objectives, the Commission proposes a truly arguable and risky formula: the speeding up of the legal process, which, in turn, would involve three actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive, that is to say, which require the participation of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, limiting those standards to the definition of the general approaches and basic principles which must be established in this field, allowing the Commission the possibility of implementing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not doubt that we have to speed up the process, Commissioner, but this Parliament is not prepared to relinquish the powers which it has taken so long to acquire. Therefore, one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to liberalisation, the first of the tasks which the Commission proposes, the Commission starts from one premise: the consolidation of the single market in financial services requires the removal of the barriers which hinder its operation. We could not agree more. The consequence is that, in order for the market to function, these barriers must be removed. Again we agree, but we know that there are difficulties in this approach resulting from the need to reconcile the objective of liberalisation with the objective of protecting investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the barriers are not identified. Commissioner, it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the Commission. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a list of those national measures which, in accordance with the Directive on financial services, are hindering the operation of the market in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the solution proposed by the Commission still raises difficulties. It is ridiculous that a financial company has to operate while being subject to, and having to have knowledge of, fifteen different legislations, but it is at least as ridiculous that an investor – especially a non-professional investor – should end up needing to contract services, bound by regulations which he or she does not know, from companies whose solvency is unknown, and, in the event of legal dispute, he or she has to take action in a foreign country, with foreign jurisdiction and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to control measures, we have a new problem: the need to adapt the competence and jurisdictions of authorities which are still national and which, on the whole, apply differing models, to a different world affected by globalisation, international competition and free movement of capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, my personal conviction is that, if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union, the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings. These are the concerns which are raised in my report. These concerns reflect a constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Commission, which I have always considered to be a loyal ally of this Parliament, in the development of an issue which is so very complex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The long run-up to this debate on a communication from the Commission is proof enough of how high feelings are running on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The issue of ‘supplementary pensions’ is a complex one and has implications for social policy, company policy, taxation policy and the capital markets. Since the publication of the Green Paper, the Commission has been concentrating on the capital market aspect and working towards the short-term aim of harmonising the prudential rules governing pension providers under the heading of “supplementary pensions in the internal market”. As such, it has already defined, in an ill-considered manner, what pensions are, thereby establishing a definition that points the way for further legislative initiatives in the taxation or social sphere, and, what is more, has initiated European legislation that will influence national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely this short-sightedness, this search for a quick fix solution, with no thought for setting long-term objectives, that the Commission is guilty of, for the goal, and what constitutes European added value from the point of view of the European citizen, companies, employees, and pensions recipients and providers, is for pension providers to have cross-border membership, which will ensure that pensions are properly integrated into the internal market. It is this European added value that we have our sights on when we urge the Commission to draw a distinction between pure capital formation and pensions in its future legislative proposals, in other words, to distinguish between providers that cover biometric risks and those that only place capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with the legislators in many Member States, our position is that one can only talk in terms of pensions if life risks such as invalidity, longevity and surviving dependants are covered. What exactly does that mean? By “covering longevity” I mean that the pensions provider is obliged to pay me a fixed pension until I die. Therefore, they can neither fob the individual entitled to receive the pension off with a fixed amount, nor reduce their pension because the person concerned is getting too old by their reckoning.</p>
<p class="contents">Provisions for surviving dependants cover those of the surviving dependants – i.e. family members – that are entitled to receive the pension of the deceased, and are dependent on this. In its turn, invalidity cover provides for a pension in the event of complete or partial inability to practise one’s profession. If we are serious about reinforcing the statutory pensions schemes with supplementary pensions in the internal market then pensions must provide cover for these risks. </p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to take biometric risks into account, then what we will have is not provisions but ‘previsions’ for old-age. But this is not just about the quality of pensions in Europe. In calling for different legal bases to be established for products and product providers that are defined in different ways, the main aim is to achieve legal certainty in Europe and to afford better opportunities for future integration into the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Equal treatment of products that do not cover biometric risks and those that do is completely at variance with our intention to introduce supplementary pensions for the European internal market. Clearly then, the Commission’s main concern is to boost the European capital market. I would take issue with this on several counts: the implementation of taxation during the pension payout period in all Member States would not just make supplementary pensions more favourable, it is a fundamental prerequisite to resource-saving, cross-border membership. In other words, companies, be they large or small, will no longer have to put fifteen different systems in place for their employees; one pensions provider will suffice. Yet taxation during the pension payout period will entail loss of income for Member States. It will only be possible to reach a consensus on taxation policy amongst the Member States if the EU provides a clearly defined legal framework – using whatever directive is appropriate – and keeps the loss of income to the Member States within bounds. Hence our demand for two directive packages: one governing pensions with obligatory coverage of biometric risks, and one for old-age provisions. Using both of these, we can attempt to achieve full European integration.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to pensions, we have a good chance of finding the solution we need in the very near future. Therefore we should not allow banks and the investment industry to talk us into short-term or short-sighted decisions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I have this request to make of you, ladies and gentlemen. Let us, as participants in codecision on future directives, use tomorrow’s vote to send the right signal to the Commission, with a view to bringing stability to old-age provisions in Europe and providing future supplementary pensions in the internal market that are in every sense worthy of the name.</p>

<p class="contents">As the main rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, has pointed out, in this regard there are two questions which are, firstly, taxation<span class="bold"> </span>– without fiscal harmonisation it would be very difficult to establish Community financial markets – and secondly, a legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legal framework, I believe that there is a paradox in this sector. The more liberalised an economy is, the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets. The American economy, which is probably one of the most liberalised economies in existence, is the economy which lays down the most detailed regulations for the financial markets. The Commission, in its proposal, on page 18 of the Spanish version, after recognising the competence of Parliament by means of codecision, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, tells us that we should move towards very flexible procedures by means of comitology. Comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur. I believe that we need some very specific legislation and I am sure that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in the drawing up of this legislation. As the rapporteur said a moment ago, we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors, consumers and, ultimately, the financial markets, if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate. The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many businesses, ranging from small businesses in border areas to large multinationals, would like to treat their accounts as one national account. For example, they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B. In this way, they would pay less interest. Existing legislation, however, prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique. The world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions. On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would now like to ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to set up a forum group which carries out market research into the legal and fiscal obstacles for businesses, SMBs, in particular, when they finance their cross-border transactions within the euro zone, in order to solve this problem. I would appreciate a reply to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission appears to be somewhat apathetic in this regard, and seems to be concentrating rather on producing a directive on prudential rules for pension funds, which is easier to achieve but less effective in terms of decision-making in relation to the elimination of barriers to labour mobility and the coordination of taxation systems. </p>
<p class="contents">The legal bases are very important, and, clearly, different: in view of the various judgements delivered by the Court of Justice, pension funds could be governed by Article 47 and Article 55, the removal of barriers to labour mobility could be governed by Article 42 and the coordination of national tax systems by Article 94. However, I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package, because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments. I refer, in particular, to biometric risks, which are a very important factor but which should be dealt with on the basis of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Indeed, making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible. I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment, and that any inflexibility of the system could, in effect, result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If 23% of Europe’s population is over 65 years old today, this figure will have reached 40% by 2025, and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020. This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes. As we all know, our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms, but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions, particularly supplementary pensions, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market, to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected. </p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds. This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible, bearing in mind our discussion today, with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to encourage the free movement of workers, we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries. This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive must in particular establish a framework to remove obstacles to the free choice of a pension fund, to the free movement of people, to the free provision of services and to charging double taxes. We recommend a solution based on the principle that contributions should be tax-deductible, and that supplementary invested income should be taxed in accordance with the income tax law in force in the country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the controversial issue of whether supplementary pension schemes should cover biometric risks, I wish to state that from the point of view of taxation, pension funds that do not cover these risks will not be discriminated against in relation to those that do. With regard to prudential regulation, this should not be disproportionate, so that the security of the fund is guaranteed. That covers the general framework. I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil. With regard to the action plan which seeks to deepen the internal financial services market, I would like to issue a warning about certain strategists who are attempting to hold the liberalisation of the financial services sector hostage, because the work that has been undertaken on the taxation of savings has not made the progress they would have wanted. As matters currently stand, we should remember that a single market for capital and financial services can function perfectly well without tax harmonisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality, I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and, as I have no speaking time left, Mr President, I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say, because as draftsperson of the Committee’s opinion and as a speaker on the second report, it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way. Instead, we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes. What we should promote is the freedom of choice of the employee and the employer to choose the kind of scheme that best suits their interests</p>
<p class="contents">The question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature. My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition. Consumers and employers must have the right to choose the most suitable form of pension scheme and, therefore, schemes covering biometric risks should be treated under the same directive as schemes not covering these risks. Both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kuckelkorn, no-one in this Parliament is of the opinion that supplementary pensions should not cover the longevity risk, through the purchase of an annuity or by some other tool. It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks. But it should be determined individually by each employee, as the Commission proposes. Leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Allowing supplementary pension scheme managers the freedom to invest in a diverse range of instruments increases the security of the overall investment portfolio. Increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am committed to the idea that we, as the European Parliament, should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual. This must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions, but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in the interest of economic operators and all consumers that the costs of capital and financial intermediation should be as low as possible. European financial markets are currently suffering from compartmentalisation along national lines, even though, following the globalisation of the international financial system, we are seeing the widespread phenomenon of mergers and internationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market. The success of the American market is basically due to ‘king dollar’. It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro. The real introduction of the euro in 2002, however, will result in transparency and competition, which will force the national markets to adapt more quickly than they had anticipated. The problem is that the legislative bodies, both national and European, are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality. Personally, I would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure, on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for non-accountable technocrats.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could make a useful contribution in the form of proposals simplifying and codifying the 11 or so directives that govern the banking sector, the 8 directives on investment funds, and the 21 directives dealing with the insurance sector. There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world, but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest. John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence. The lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria, which often leads to financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of capital must be accompanied by an efficient regulatory and prudential framework, because supervision of the various markets is divided up according to country and sector, but at the same time, as a result of mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations, boundaries between banks, insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds are disappearing. Finland and the United Kingdom have drawn conclusions from this and have established a single prudential authority for the whole sector. Article 105(6) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council can entrust the ECB with specific tasks relating to policies on the prudential supervision of credit companies and other financial companies, with the exception of insurance companies. Should the Council not use the Intergovernmental Conference to establish the necessary legal basis for the Council to be able to entrust the ECB with certain specific tasks relating to the prudential supervision of insurance companies too?</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, for the tenacity with which he argues in favour of supplementary pensions and for these to become in effect a second pillar of insurance for old age. I shall conclude, Mr President, by pointing out that it amounts to saying that whilst we should not discard insurance products we must favour products which cover biometric risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up until now, it has mostly been a matter of words and all too few concrete measures. At present, the financial services market and, through this, Europe’s power to grow have been impeded by countless national regulations and administrative complications. These are detrimental not only to companies but also, of course, to Europe’s citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">The development of the Internet is, and will be, of great importance to the provision of financial services across national borders. Above all, it is consumers who will benefit from this development because they will have greater choice and access to lower prices. </p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals do not regard tax harmonisation as a prerequisite for bringing the single market for financial services to fruition, even if a degree of harmonisation may prove to be necessary to avoid harmful competition over taxes. The euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital, something which benefits both companies and private households. </p>
<p class="contents">It is my conviction that, if the EU is to be able to provide Europe’s citizens with growth and strength, then all Member States must participate fully in the EU project, that is to say, be members of EMU. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Romano Prodi’s statement today in a Swedish newspaper to the effect that Sweden could stay outside EMU is therefore both surprising from an economic point of view and doubtful in terms of the Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Green Paper on liberalising complementary forms of pension protection is something we welcome. It is nonetheless important to emphasise that pension cover in Europe is characterised by national diversity and that there is no need to harmonise the various systems in order to create a single market. It is important that a large number of systems should exist side by side. This increases choice and diversity. However, it is desirable, in order to avoid double taxation, to introduce a minimum degree of harmonisation in regard to the Member States’ treatment of supplementary pensions for tax purposes. I also consider that the Member States themselves should be able to determine what the system should look like, for example whether or not the care of relatives should be covered by pensions. This is an issue which can be resolved better at national level. </p>
<p class="contents">In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks. Views were put forward to the effect that only those systems which cover risks of this kind are to be included under the directive. We do not believe that this should be the case, especially in view of the need for small and medium-sized companies to be able to do business. Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to congratulate Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn for two important reports designed to create a competitive Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was bound to happen has happened. There has been fiscal dumping onto the most mobile factors and a transfer of the tax burden onto the least mobile factor, which is labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for blocking the tax harmonisation provided for in the Monti package currently rests entirely with one country: Great Britain. Great Britain is trying to shift the blame onto Luxembourg, which is actually willing to compromise. Let me formally notify our British colleagues that this attitude is irritating the rest of Europe. Great Britain is the mother of democracy and of modern capitalism. Its attitude of encouraging tax fraud has a corrupting effect not only in economic and social terms, but in moral terms as well. It is challenging the civic foundations of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has decided to reject any new proposal to liberalise the capital market, unless the Monti package is first adopted. This is the suggestion, moreover, of Mr Prodi’s Commission itself, and that was the key point of the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the action plan to unite the financial services markets. Unfortunately, this point has been changed out of all recognition by the amendments of the right within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are not only two quite different goals, but it is also difficult to combine them in one and the same system. The Commission’s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market. The hope is that the market-based pensions will then also prove to be good for pensioners in thirty or forty years’ time. How matters will turn out, however, we do not know. If one considers how Europe has changed during the last thirty to forty years and acknowledges that circumstances are going to change just as much in the future, then one can see how uncertain such forecasts are. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a large deficit when it comes to security and solidarity in the pensions area because the risk is so great and because there can never be enough security and solidarity. Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem. They are, of course, much less secure than a system of basic pensions which has been financed on the basis of solidarity. </p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that supplementary assurances and supplementary pensions may be needed, but then their managers ought to be obliged to invest in such instruments as provide solid savings in the long term, instead of having short-term rates on the stock exchange and global financial capitalism determine how matters will stand for pensioners in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it would have been commendable if these supplementary pension systems could have been run as pension funds on the basis of solidarity under the aegis of trade unions, as happens in certain Member States. Even if these too are market-based, they offer much more in terms of stability and security than the privatised pension assurances. It now looks as if we are to have a liberal arrangement in the pensions field in Europe, and I shall therefore advise my voters to invest their surplus funds in safer instruments than private pension assurances. To young people I would say: pin your hopes on education and on developing your skills. And to older people I would say: acquire a nice, inexpensive place to live in the autumn of your years. We politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good, sound system of basic pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, the intention of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who has carried out a vast amount of work, for which I would like to thank him, is not expressed very well in the motion for a resolution. It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote. </p>
<p class="contents">The principal aim is for workers, when they move to another Member State, to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value. Unfortunately, the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish. We have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between Member States will be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules. It is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies. A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable. A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks. Insurance companies do offer their participants a choice, and their products do not cover biometric risks. Since the risks covered are not identical, government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies. On account of this supervision, complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases. This leads on average to higher returns. We need to avoid creating a situation where the individual is forced, on account of significantly lower returns on pension funds, to enter the wild investment woods in search of their supplementary pension schemes, where the big bad wolf is after their money. </p>
<p class="contents">The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States. Taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population, it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions. The EET model, where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed, meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are conscious of the fact that numerous pension schemes in the various Member States, based on the intergeneration compact, are encountering ever-increasing difficulties. That is why the issue of supplementary pensions has become so very important, and that is what we are discussing this evening. When it comes to supplementary pensions and pension funds, our first priority in regulatory terms is to ensure that the rules governing the Common Market are upheld, and that no additional restrictions to the free movement of persons within the European Community are created, as is often the case.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that this is still the case today for many social security systems, and we must avoid the possibility of similar restrictions to the free movement of persons arising in this new sphere as well. That is why certain common minimum provisions need to be put in place here. We need certain minimum regulations for the protection of financial investments, and we anticipate that suitable proposals will be drafted and improved on to this end. </p>
<p class="contents">The second quite crucial issue is that of tax breaks, this being possible at three different stages: at the paying-in stage, then afterwards on the interest that is paid, and then at the payout stage. The arrangements for this vary from one Member State to another, and if we want these funds to be compatible throughout the European Community then we are going to have to produce common provisions. This is not going to be a piece of cake. We all know that taxation is subject to the unanimity principle, but this is one of the fundamental demands we have to make.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the crunch question of this debate, namely what are pensions? What are pension funds? I have to say, we are still only halfway through the debate where this is concerned. We have not reached a conclusive opinion within our Group either. There is only one thing I can say with certainty: biometric risks must play a part in this overall assessment in some respect. In other words, if we do not take biometric risks into account, then it will not be possible to address the other issues I have mentioned. But we are quite deliberately proposing an open style of wording, as chosen by Mr Ferri for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in points 7 and 8. I believe this kind of wording will attract the broadest consensus here, and therefore enable us to make progress, for what matters most is that the directives are now put forward to us. I believe it will not be possible to answer some of the questions we are discussing today until we can assess them in the light of the Commission’s proposals, the actual draft directives, that is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A directive must not be used to make a name for a particular form of insurance and what is more, to equate provisions for old age with capital building processes, because at the end of the day, supplementary pensions products are no ordinary investment products. That is why I really think it is very important for us to have different taxation systems in the Member States, particularly for those products that also cover biometric risks.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That is why today’s debate has in fact enabled us to embark on the further deepening of the single market, for in the single market and the euro we have, for the first time, the environment we need to get the financial service providers in the EU to operate in a truly efficient manner, and to enable us to take account of the idea of financial legislation and financial supervision.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Of course we would not wish to deter the market participants from making good use of improved business opportunities. On the other hand though, we also want to safeguard financial stability and consumer protection interests. The European Summit in Lisbon was right to emphasise again the importance of having integrated and efficient financial markets, and this House will also be in favour of keeping to a strict timetable. At the same time though, we must do all we can, in view of the single market and the introduction of the euro, to improve the capital base for small and medium-sized enterprises and high technology companies in particular. We must also do all we can to take account of measures favouring effective, cross-border consumer protection in the process. It will also be necessary, to this end, to improve cooperation between the regulatory and supervisory authorities at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for financial stability, and it has to be said at this point, that the increase in company mergers in the financial sector constitutes a serious problem at present. We would also do well to refer to the OECD reports, which make clear reference to the risks posed by megamergers in this sector. At the end of the day, when financial conglomerates that are too big to fail come into being, not only does this increase the moral hazard of the institutes concerned, but the economic and financial policies of the States concerned are also faced with new risks. We must do everything we can to prevent any weakening of financial stability, for this would lead to companies making use of the profits and tax payers having to sustain any losses.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that there is no direct consideration of consumer protection in the Lisbon Conclusions. Unless we establish a reliable legal framework which is as informative and transparent as it could possibly be, not to mention liability for the benefit of the consumer, it will not be possible to complete the single market…</p>

Firstly, I would like to express my agreement with the model based on the intergenerational solidarity of the basic state systems, to which are added the supplementary capitalisation systems. On the other hand, I would also like to express my agreement with what Mr Kuckelkorn says in relation to the correlation established between pension systems which cover biometric risks. We are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans. On the other hand, we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes<span class="bold"> </span>which cover biometric risks. It is necessary to clarify, on the other hand, that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers, fortunately. We must opt for collective systems, but not only company systems – something which is mentioned in the report – but also sectoral ones, taking particular account of SMBs, which have been mentioned by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel. We must take account of the great difficulties which exist within the Union with regard to the development of supplementary systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore understand and support the regulatory and supervisory systems for the protection of the rights of participants, but we must put the emphasis on the areas where systems are still underdeveloped, in aspects such as providing information or implementing new plans.</p>

The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course. The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance, which would gradually replace social security. Welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market. The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets. A system of this type is very dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the richest people, those who can save money, and leaves the poorest with a pittance of a retirement pension.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kuckelkorn’s initial report considered the retirement pension primarily as social insurance against certain life risks, rather than a process of accumulating capital. It has been radically changed, however, by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation. I cannot, therefore, approve this report which makes the Commission’s approach even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained, based on solidarity, regardless of financial profitability. The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension, in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population, between generations, between men and women, between the public and the private sectors. The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages. Employers’ contributions should be linked to companies’ employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the UK, as in the US, Chile and Singapore and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes, involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals. Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change, and third-pillar portable schemes, in particular, which are not restricted to single companies, enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe, even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested. The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion, with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20% of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, many risks with equity investments, but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies. Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU, but also in developing markets, with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of defined contribution schemes, which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy, there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual. The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age. But personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully. That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies. We need a light-touch regulatory framework, with bilateral tax agreements, which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union, achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need tax harmonisation if we are to make the single market an attractive proposition. We need taxation during the pension payout period, as proposed in the agreement, because only then will the cross-border aspect hold some appeal for potential members. After all, why should the Finance Ministers pay twice? They will have to pay once for departing from an input taxation system, and they will then have to take a decrease in tax revenue on board at a later date. At the same time, they will have to help foot the bill for any unsatisfactory products they have helped to promote which do not prevent poverty in old age, and they might even have to pay a third time because, in addition, they will have to finance poverty in old age from public coffers. These Finance Ministers may then have to pay yet again because they will have to resign their posts, as punishment for their foolish actions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the debate as presented to us in Amendment No 30, on the freedom of choice of the insured, is a pseudo discussion. I have this to say to those of you that support this argument: these are the same insured whom only a few weeks ago a majority of you undertook to allow to participate in decisions on the fund capacity, on the use of the amounts paid in, which are often a slice of people’s wages, and you gave an undertaking to these same people that those who act on your behalf would be involved in making sure that the funds in question were put to good use.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We are very much in favour of the citizens of Europe having the freedom to decide, but, that being the case, let us be quite clear about what we mean by the principle of subsidiarity. According to catholic social doctrine, subsidiarity means that we should actually enable the small units – the families and most dependent employees – to make their own provisions for old-age, and that we should concern ourselves not so much with the investment interests of individual suppliers of products as a criteria, but with how we can reduce the number of hurdles to vesting periods. We must talk about how we are to organise the codecision rights of the insured and their representatives, and we must also discuss how investment capital is to flow into spheres that will generate worthwhile new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it seeks nothing less than to open up all European pension schemes to the financial markets. Indeed, it recommends the development of a truly single pension fund market by referring to the inevitability of resorting to capitalisation. It should be noted, by the way, that when the financial interests of the most powerful are involved, they are not slow to forget the principle of solidarity and to propose a single model.</p>
<p class="contents">This report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes. The truth is that it is not an attempt to supplement state pension schemes, but rather to gradually empty them of all substance. Those who are employed know full well, however, that a pension is theirs by right. They fought for this right, which is based on intergenerational solidarity. That is why they do not, under any circumstances, want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange. In several countries, powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts. Their threats have to this day prevented the French government, for example, from introducing pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This is in perfect harmony with past, present and future struggles, and it is in support of them that we shall be voting against a report that reduces this Parliament to the level of a lobby for high finance. Retired people need an adequate, stable and safe pension. Pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that. On this issue, as on many others, a choice must be made between increasing the profits of a few or satisfying the needs of all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore tell you what I think: I am in favour of having a single market for financial services and liberalising the market, but, when it comes to supplementary company pensions, protective mechanisms must be put in place for employees, and the social market economy must be stimulated. Therefore I also advocate that the supplementary pension packages, which include biometric risks, should offer special advantages to those entitled to benefits and to society as a whole, and that they should therefore receive preferential treatment, whilst allowing people to retain the option of choosing one of the others, because what I do not want is for those who are mobile to be socially worse off than those who stay at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He clearly wants to take steps towards developing a European internal market for supplementary pension schemes. I think he deserves tribute for this. </p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from a country where a very extensive second pillar of supplementary pensions exists. Almost 90% of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wage-related pension. This also includes small and medium-sized businesses. </p>
<p class="contents">With a capacity of over EUR 150 billion, the pension fund of Dutch civil servants is the largest institutional investor of its kind within the international capital market. Pension funds in the Netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments. In 1999, nearly half of the pension money was invested in shares, albeit under strict prudential conditions. But the average return over the past five years has been around 15%, instead of the usual 4%. </p>
<p class="contents">It has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results. The fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level. On balance, this yields a far better return for individual members, much better than they could ever achieve on their own via a savings plan or investment fund. Therefore, I must open Mrs Kauppi’s eyes and disprove her reasoning that individual workers would be better off making their own choices, even if they belong to the fortunate ones who do not have any hereditary diseases, who are young and male, because, unfortunately, Mrs Kauppi, we women are even worse off under individual schemes as we live longer than men on average. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I would strongly discourage you from formulating a principle of free choice at European level. If I were you, I would leave this to the Member States and the free market. </p>
<p class="contents">As for biometric risks, other speakers have already talked enough about this. I fully endorse Mr Kuckelkorn in this respect and would argue that such a definition is very important because we are expecting a number of additional directives from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This system restricts employees who want to guarantee a retirement pension for themselves that will give them enough to live on, to make their money available to investment funds, trusts, insurance companies or other private financial groups. At the same time, it makes the value of pensions subordinate to the financial markets, in other words, to speculation. What is more, all those whose salaries are too low for them to be able to pay into a pension fund will be entitled only to a very meagre pension.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle. Productivity has increased tenfold in the last fifty years and if company owners and shareholders had not transformed the fruits of this productivity into purely private profit, it would now enable salaries to be higher and would guarantee appropriate pensions for everyone. If contributory pension schemes are having problems, it is only because there are fewer employed people in proportion to the number of retired people, because there are too many unemployed and because salaries are too low. So, if there is a shortfall in pension funds, States should take over by deducting the necessary amounts from the profits of industrial and financial groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a young Member of this Parliament I am of course thinking of young people, whose pensions are currently the least secure. We also need to safeguard freedom of movement in Europe and to ensure that those individuals, particularly young people, who are mobile within Europe do not suffer any disadvantage compared with those who remain in their own country all their lives. So as not to lose sight of the fact that we want secure pensions, what we also need to do is to liberalise the financial market in Europe and to create a framework so as to make the single market, as well as the German and the European financial market, competitive in the face of global competition.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group has not taken the easy way out. We are still having intense discussions on this, focussing in particular on the second pillar, in the course of which we have learnt that the first pillar, state pensions, is no longer viable and we must strengthen the second pillar. Two arguments are in order here. If we are to strengthen the second pillar then it must be made equivalent to the first and built up accordingly, that is, it must take account of the biometric risks. Or one could argue that it is necessary to admit new products so as to enable this sector to develop in an effective manner and yield the necessary return, thereby securing pensions for the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My personal preference is to make people fully aware of the biometric risks and to put this issue right at the heart of the Commission’s agenda over the next six months. When it comes to the three biometric risks in question, I have a particular preference for longevity, which is an unshakeable fact in my view. But we should not establish a system today. The world keeps spinning, as do the financial markets, and we should also be open to new influences. We must accommodate subsidiarity within the competition of systems, but also within the competition of taxation law. I hope that the Commission will do justice to this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasing mobility on the part of employees in the European Union necessitates a Community legal framework for managing complementary pensions schemes. But there is also a long overdue need to bring order to taxation systems. </p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, it has of course occurred to me that the Commission’s proposal is definitely only aimed at harmonising investment regulations, which does not do justice to the issue, that is to say, it completely misses the point. What I am saying is that we now have the perfect opportunity to extend the European social system further and to develop it further in a judicious manner. Remember that complementary pensions schemes are schemes that make provision for old age. This makes sense and there are many reasons as to why it is absolutely essential that we bear this in mind for the future. If pensions are one of our real concerns then we must ensure that they are of a high quality, and account must be taken of the biometric risks. Only good quality products will be able, in the context of the second and third pillars, to fulfil a social function for the European social model. Otherwise, all we would be talking about here would be capital redemption insurance, which is not the same thing at all. That would constitute misrepresentation of the product.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore please do not support the idea that it is necessary to channel the capital investment products already in existence into the European social model. That would do our cause no good at all.</p>

Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most. Unfortunately, we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">A developed collective system of supplementary pensions, compulsory if so required by the relevant Member State, considerably reduces the dependence on demographic factors and enables the pension fund, in the role of investor, to derive maximum benefit from the possibilities which financial markets have to offer. Needless to say, the objective of making employees more mobile and flexible within a large single European market and the euro zone will inevitably lead to interest in supplementary pension schemes. One of the philosophies underlying the European Union and the Monetary Union requires that the internal market should be used to the full. As such, you, as a worker, should be able to take your accumulated pension rights with you to another European country. To this end, we need to develop a legal framework at European level at the earliest opportunity. Why should a German employee, for example, have to wait ten years before he has built up a pension and a Dutch person only one year? As such, this German person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility. What is more, the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line. Commissioner, you deal with taxes, what is the latest on this score? </p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that this parliamentary discussion seems to be more about a complete harmonisation than coordination. This, unfortunately, is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order. One such country is the Netherlands, initially presented as a role model for all other Member States and gradually relegated to curiosity status. But the Dutch system is a worthy system which accepts old age, surviving dependants and vulnerable groups within the labour market as they are. The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity. This enables SMBs – and specifically SMBs with reference to the UK MEPs – to cover biometric risks at relatively low cost. Top of the list are payability and security, which is not the case for the proposals submitted by some MEPs. Mr Bolkestein, how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter, namely mobile pensions for mobile people? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key word is “supplementary” pensions. We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement. The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe. So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility. The key is to keep it simple or it will not work, it will not remove the obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Tannock has said, there are demographic pressures upon us and it is in our interest to facilitate the development of supplementary pension schemes both around Europe and also in many countries within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of biometric risks, which we have heard a lot about, clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk, which is longevity. Once you start building on top of that, you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport. What we need is to have a very simple proposition, and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for.</p>
<p class="contents">The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people. We must try and get a simple product which is marketable and can be moved around this market, because if we do not, we will end up with a product that does not work at all that the different Member States cannot make use of. So the key is to keep it simple and make it work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Laguiller, the people trusted the states and the governments, especially the pledges made by left-wing governments, but they have been left with peanuts. Every day, thousands upon thousands of elderly people reach retirement age and ask their governments, “Where are our pensions?” And the governments reply, “You are living too long and there is no more money left to give you”, concealing the truth.

In almost all Member States the pension systems comprise three elements: statutory pension schemes, company pension schemes and supplementary private pension schemes. The point has already been made on numerous occasions that action is called for, in view of the falling birth rate within the European Union, to make pension schemes more efficient than they have been hitherto. Discussion is currently ongoing in all Member States as to how we can reform the pensions system. All Member States are also agreed that our goal must be to safeguard people’s standard of living in old age.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Statutory pensions will no longer be able to fulfil this task on their own in the medium- to short-term. Consequently it is only right to extend pensions in the second pillar, i.e. company pensions, and private pension provisions. As has already been said repeatedly, the Kuckelkorn report concerns itself with pensions in the second pillar, i.e. company pensions. What do we understand pensions to mean? Again, as has already been said, opinions differ here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I intend to confine myself to this point in what I have to say. In many Member States, pensions are understood to mean the safeguarding of fundamental aspects of life. This entails covering what are known as the biometric risks, and providing financial security in old age, in the event of invalidity or for surviving dependants in the event of the death of the insured party. What this actually means, for example, is that an employee who has a car accident at the age of 35 and becomes an invalid, receives not only the capital he has paid in up to that point but also a proper company pension, because he is the same position as if he had worked until he was 60 years old.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies when a 35 year-old employee has a fatal car accident, leaving a wife and two children. If the biometric risks have been covered, then the surviving dependants will receive a proper company pension in this case as well, and not just the capital he had paid in up until his death. We must ensure that the concept of a pension is not just understood to mean a form of savings scheme, for a capital investment…</p>

I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Kuckelkorn as rapporteur, for the huge effort he has made to achieve this report. I am slightly less pleased with Mr Kuckelkorn’s tabling of amendments, because he has tabled a great many and they go beyond the requirements of the current objective. I think that we should differentiate between the two Kuckelkorns.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles. One of them is simply the statutory pay-as-you-go system and the other is the system of capital cover which is an extension of the former, it is just that the only problem we are facing is that all countries have very different starting positions. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that a country such as the Netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two. Other countries have managed to do this to a lesser extent. Also, for example, countries where nearly all pensions are capital cover systems, such as Great Britain, do not meet expectations because, although the risks for the government are reasonably small, the cover for the retired is extremely modest. In England, if there is a hard frost, for example, people are unable to pay their bills. I do not think that this is the right way forward. </p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we need to remember that this is about people and based on this, we must develop a system which makes sound pension schemes possible, and we must, as far as we can, leave this task to the Member States. We should keep intervention to a minimum. We need to bear our starting point in mind, namely that if people move from one country to another to work or retire, it should be possible for them to take their pensions with them. The Commission has always attempted to do this and I do believe that it has succeeded in its aim. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that two issues still need tackling. Firstly, risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered, because far too little has been said about this. Secondly, the first pillar should at long last be defined, as the first pillar in one country is quite different from that in another country. And if we could bring all of this a bit closer together, we would perhaps have far fewer problems than we have at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be possible to favour cross-border pension funds or similar schemes, which cover many of the aforementioned risks, for example by having minimum regulations governing tax law.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Quite often, a reduction in contributions is taken account of with statutory pensions schemes in the Member States, as in Germany, with any shortfall to be made up by supplementary company schemes. Naturally the statutory system makes provision for widows and invalidity pensions, for example. We therefore need appropriate regulations for supplementary schemes, otherwise the collective agreement we need will simply not be feasible. </p>
<p class="contents">A second moot point is that of codetermination. I am in favour of compromising with “cooperation” rather than introducing the frequently obstructive concept of “codetermination”. Minimum codetermination rights for the beneficiaries are what we need to aim for, at least in the case of closed systems such as company pension funds, for example through an investment committee which establishes the principles of investment policy. We need, as a matter of urgency, to set the course for the future. It is becoming increasingly important for people to make their own supplementary provisions for old age, in order to safeguard their standard of living. People need time to make these provisions. That is the alternative to manipulating and fiddling statutory pension schemes.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, may I start by extending warm thanks to both rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn, for the reports they have drafted and the efforts they have made. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, could I also warmly thank all other speakers this evening – nearly thirty of them – for the comments they have made and questions they have asked. This is an important matter, both the action plan for financial services and the pension issue, and it is heartening to see so many speakers take part in the exchange of opinions. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report is concerned, I would like to note that, according to the Commission, it is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between an important political vision and the technical measures required in order to make progress. Perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect. I hope, at the same time, to comment on the amendments which have been tabled. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect. In this context, I would also refer to Parliament’s request for streamlined rules for stock market access, market manipulation and revision of the investment services directive. The opening up of financial markets should, naturally, go hand in hand with an adequate level of consumer protection, and this was also requested this evening in this debate. They are thus parallel processes, with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other, and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue. These are the European Commission’s twin objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">We also have a few specific proposals in this respect. Firstly, we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens. Secondly, we would like to see better and clearer dispute procedures for citizens who are dissatisfied with foreign financial dealers. Thirdly, we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules. The fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce, or e-commerce for short. Policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers. Our citizens, on the other hand, must experience the same level of confidence and protection for transactions on-line as they do off-line. Finally, an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions. Does this mean that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role? The ECB itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary. There is in fact an alternative, to wit, a coming together of supervisory systems. </p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, Mr President, I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath. It is an important remark. Mrs Randzio-Plath has picked up some noises from the OECD and mentioned the word mega-risk. Indeed, I think she is right to indicate the risks which can be inherent in financial movements. She has referred to large mergers which are taking place and, without necessarily sharing her view regarding these risks, I would also like to refer to statements made by Mr Lamfalussi, who is well-known within the European financial system, and who has also indicated the need to be able to cope adequately with the financial risks and system risks which are heading our way. This is a very important matter. I still believe that coordination, cooperation and harmonisation of supervisory systems are enough to withstand the risks, but, once again, in the interest of the case itself, I would like to draw the attention of Mrs Randzio-Plath and other members of this meeting to a report recently drafted by Mr Brouwer, second-in-command at the Central Bank in the Netherlands. This report was commissioned by the Economic and Financial Committee, which, as you are aware, is the gateway to the ECOFIN Council, and the report deals with financial stability. The report will be made available shortly. No doubt you will be able to find it on the Internet. This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath’s heart and once again, I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, most of the points I mentioned a moment ago can be found in the draft report of the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, and also in many of the tabled amendments. In sum, I would like to say that we will undoubtedly continue to discuss the nuts and bolts but as far as the main points are concerned, I do consider Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report as welcome confirmation of the Commission’s vision. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words on the way in which a number of these measures need to be implemented, the need to take a close look at our legislative ethos and the way in which legislation is established. Everyone is currently in agreement that we need to drop over-complicated, fossilised legislation, in other words, rules which cannot keep pace with fast market development. Accordingly, the process by which the European Union, i.e. the concerted efforts of Commission, Parliament and Council, lays down rules should be quicker. But how exactly can this be done? There are quite a few different ideas and quite a few misconceptions, because if Mr García-Margallo y Marfil tells me that the European Parliament does not want to give up any of the powers it has only recently acquired, then I naturally share his view. I myself have been a Member of Parliament for a long time, so I fully understand where Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is coming from. In fact, this is not the Commission’s intention, even if it was authorised to take decisions in this respect, which is not the case. Nonetheless, we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules. I would invite the Members of this Parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process. Should we make more use of comitology procedures? Should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading? At any rate, the Commission intends to keep Parliament and the competent committees informed of the agendas more quickly and more effectively, so that these agendas can be better harmonised and we can speed up the drafting of the required legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to keep this Parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan. Every six months, we send a progress report to the ECOFIN Council and it seems to me that these reports could be used to exchange views with Parliament on this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter. In its communication on pensions, the Commission has included proposals on three fronts. The first area is prudential rules for pension funds, and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage. There is no question that rules could be introduced which could threaten the rights of future pensioners. This is beyond dispute. However, this does not detract from the fact that investment and management rules can also serve the interests of people other than pension scheme members. In fact futile provisions that inhibit the results of investments, do pension scheme members no favours and must be repealed for this reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the coordination of national tax systems is a condition for cross-border participation. Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people? Other Members too, such as Mr von Wogau and others, have talked about the need to enhance the mobility of workers within the European Union. As already stated, this does not require harmonisation (a word we need to use with discretion because it conjures up incorrect associations in certain Member States) so much as coordination. So it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs. This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility. The Commission is in the process of drafting a proposal, a general framework, intended to facilitate the payment of contributions by occupational pension institutions which are located in other Member States. This general framework has also been requested, of course, in this meeting by Mr Medina Ortega, for example, while Mrs Peijs has also indicated the need to set up this general framework. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to refer to the constant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. This jurisprudence has demonstrated that the restrictions which apply to cross-border contributions and premiums are at odds with the Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s third objective is to remove the obstacles which migrant workers are faced with. More than anything, and this is also underlined in the draft report – rightly so – we should facilitate the transferability of rights from one Member State to another, and this is also very much in the interests of employee mobility, of course. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, concerning the motion for a resolution, I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament’s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures. It was with great interest that I read the sterling report of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, and the competent committees, a report that so far has covered an extensive and technically complex area. I did not fail to notice that Parliament is backing the lines of policy proposed by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the motion for a resolution, I would like to make the following brief comments. The motion presses for the general introduction of the tax levy model that relies on the taxation of the pension payout whilst providing for tax exemption for contributions to the fund and returns on the fund. The desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by Mr Blokland, among others. Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this. This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution. Agreement on this approach would solve the problems of either double taxation or no taxation, which is what citizens and Member States are struggling with at the moment. However, I would like to point out that this issue, as is known, only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and, as such, falls outside the scope of the European Commission. The Commission should ensure, however, if different systems continue to coexist in future too, that this does not have any adverse effects on workers exercising their right to mobility within the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the amendments tabled, I would like to stress one point in particular, namely the scope of the future proposal – as the directive is not yet finished – for a directive regulating the activities of occupational pension funds. In other words, the question is, and many Members attending this evening’s meeting have spoken about this, Mrs Kauppi, in particular: should this proposal, which we are about to disclose, provide for all forms of pension schemes or should it simply be restricted to pension scheme products which cover the members against biometric risks? My answer to this is as follows, I hope it is clear: we need European prudential standards for all forms of occupational pension schemes. These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions. But there is not one single technical reason why these different types of savings schemes could not be combined in one and the same directive. It would, in my view, be incorrect – and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself – if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which, although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age, should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive, according to a number of delegates. I believe that this is not right. I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive, as I pointed out a moment ago. </p>
<p class="contents">Well now, Member States are thus given every opportunity to give certain pension products preferential treatment by using tax incentive measures, for example. They can also demand that the products offered on their market, even if the institutions offering the service are based in another Member State, meet certain social criteria. Employees and employers within one company or one sector are free to choose, according to the benefits and drawbacks of the products available on their market. In other words, there is still a large degree of freedom for the Member States to arrange the pension systems within their own country as they see fit. This freedom remains. The Commission’s ambition is to create, I repeat, one framework which liberalises the setting up and scope of pension funds for the benefit of all the members of such pension funds. </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we need to set up this legal framework within the European Union which enables businesses and future pensioners to choose the products on offer within a transparent market by institutions which are adequately supervised. Adequate supervision is crucial, as is liberalising the scope of pension funds. It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail. Indeed this is a matter which falls under the subsidiarity principle, and the European Commission would not wish to do anything which could compromise this principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would, however, mean that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would have to stay even longer at this meeting. This is not such a bad thing, in my opinion. In the final analysis, many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but since she has reminded me of this question, which, as I have already said, I would have addressed at a later stage, let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market. It is true that small and medium-sized businesses are facing obstacles in their cross-border activities. The Commission is acutely aware of this. Needless to say, the scope of the internal market is intended to facilitate cross-border activities for small and medium-sized businesses. The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures, many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses. But if Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would like to approach me with specific problems relating to small and medium-sized businesses which are not covered in the new strategy for the internal market, I shall make every effort to address these points to her satisfaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
