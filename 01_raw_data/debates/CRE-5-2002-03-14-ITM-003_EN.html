<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to extol the virtues of fish as a healthy food. With food scandals left, right and centre, there is surely nothing wrong with highlighting the benefits of healthy eating. Which is where fish come in. It is an established fact that an ever increasing proportion of the pro capita consumption of fish is in the form of processed products. That includes not just canned fish but the whole range of fish on offer, from smoked to frozen fish.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of turnover, the fish processing industry in the European Union is almost twice as large as the fisheries sector. Given the financial clout of this industry, with turnover in excess of EUR 10 billion, and its vital contribution to the food supply in the EU, I am surprised – with all due respect, Mr Fischler – that the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy pays such scant attention to this sector, especially when the statistics are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it provides almost 100 000 jobs throughout Europe. Secondly, it involves thousands of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, often located in structurally-challenged regions with few alternative forms of employment. Thirdly, it has a long tradition of added-value processing in its many and varied forms.</p>
<p class="contents">All this clearly illustrates that the few sentences on the fish processing industry in the Green Paper are far too little and fail to take proper account of this sector, which is why I proposed this own initiative report, to draw attention to this neglected sector and, more importantly, to test out the room for political manoeuvre here in the run up to the reform of the common fisheries policy. A hearing on the subject in the Committee on Fisheries gave us an interesting insight into the many and varied working conditions, production methods and problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few problem areas which I should like to highlight. First and foremost, the supply of raw materials. The fish-processing industry depends on imports for over 50% of its supplies. Admittedly, these are raw materials which the EU fleet cannot supply, which is why we need to improve conditions and guarantee security of supply. That includes reducing customs tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, environmental measures. The profitability of the processing industry, with its piecemeal structure, has been drastically reduced in certain cases by the environmental measures taken by the EU. Environmental protection is important, whether it concerns waste water, packaging or emissions. But we need to avoid unnecessary distortions as the result of specifications coming too thick and fast. What good is the cleanest water to us, if there are no jobs left in coastal regions?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, food safety. One thing is clear; the fish-processing industry does not cause pollution and toxins. Rather, it is the victim of these, which is why it should not be left to shoulder the burden alone. Surely the purpose of consumer protection is not to set limit values on the basis of the principle: ‘Value XY might be dangerous, so let us stick a 150% safety margin on top of it’. Reliable, toxicologically proven limit values make sense, rush jobs and thrashing about in the dark do not. I should like the Member States in particular to take good note of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, enlargement. The candidate countries are knocking at our door. Some countries have done exemplary work on hygiene and health protection. But there are still massive problems to be resolved before adequate standards can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, fundamentals. We need more information on this sector, which is why we have called for an analysis from the Commission. The impact of aid from the FIFG must also be examined carefully, because we do not want a sector which is drip-fed by the EU, we want an industry which is vital and can hold its own in the twenty-first century. Waiving aid in favour of self-help should relate at most to areas which are highly dependent on fisheries in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral of the story is that the fish-processing industry needs a higher profile in Europe. This was the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, with just one vote against. I therefore trust that I can count on your full support for this report when we vote on it at 12 noon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, in light of the magnificent report that has been produced, I also welcome the fact that it was drafted by our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, whom I wish to congratulate once again on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">As our rapporteur said, we feel that the Commission is not addressing the issue of this industry with the appropriate seriousness. The Green Paper is a clear example of this. This is why we expect more from the Commission in terms of its proposals, and I would say that this report is apt for that very reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The Langenhagen report addresses the problem as a whole. In 1998, we drew up a specific report on the canning industry – for which I had the honour of being rapporteur – but this report provides an update and, furthermore, encompasses the entire industry, including frozen products and the marketing aspects, as well as the products of aquaculture.</p>
<p class="contents">From Mrs Langenhagen’s report I should like to highlight her observations on both the global and European frameworks, taking account of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first case, she considers the liberalisation of imports of raw materials, which is very important, and makes specific exceptions for sensitive products such as tuna loins. She also refers to quality, to the environmental and health and hygiene standards of European products compared to imports, in order to protect European consumers from labelling fraud, which has occurred in the cases of sardines and tuna.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, as has been said, plans are being made to deal with the consequences of the candidate countries’ accession, but in a way that does not damage the industry in regions which are behind in economic terms, and which are currently experiencing difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the report calls for our fisheries products to be promoted more vigorously and for more assistance with R+D to be given to our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by stating, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, that we will be supporting the three amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists but that we shall be voting against Amendment No 4 by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, because we feel that the text submitted by our rapporteur is better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We socialists have tabled two amendments, to which I should like to ask the rapporteur to give her express support, on the social aspects of the processing industry, urging the Commission, the Member States and social operators to boost the collective negotiation designed to improve the quality of employment in this industry, especially bearing in mind that the majority of these jobs are performed by women, who have very little social protection and who, furthermore, commonly work on a highly casual basis. It is our view that adopting this approach would bring us closer to the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit to improve the quality of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that improving the training of these nearly 100 000 workers in the processing industry and its conditions of employment, together with this sector’s own capacity for innovation and its dynamic, will help to ensure that this industry remains viable and that it has a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, I would still like to make a few observations. In the original recital G, it is stated that the import of fish and fisheries products from outside the EU by the processing industry could lead to conflicting interests. This is not always the case. Such imports often provide good incentives for the processing industry and can thus help maintain a good price level for European fishermen. Such a misconception is indicative of a general problem which, in my view, we are facing in our committee. There are many areas where we – to a greater or lesser extent – lack sufficient insight into how matters stand. Unfortunately, we frequently have to make new policy without having all the relevant information on which to base it. We must therefore try to obtain more insight into how things are. I am of the opinion that, with regard to research, the emphasis must be on reliability and speed. I would ask the Commission to ensure that we can have concrete, up-to-date information at our disposal, so that we can take the right decisions in all these areas at the right times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fish processing industry employs 18 140 people in the UK, that is, 20% of the EU jobs in this sector. The majority of these jobs are in Scotland, and in some of the most peripheral areas of Scotland. These jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas. Much more than that, they provide us with the finished fish product. Without the workers in this industry we would not enjoy the fish we take for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Fisheries held a hearing and saw that the priorities for the industry were supply, continued employment, the environment, food safety, imports and also the consequences of enlargement. We know that some of our stocks are at seriously low levels, and therefore when there is a ban on cod fishing, it is not just the fishermen, but the processors that lose out too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to work towards availability of supply, but balance this with high hygiene levels and sustainability of that supply. The processing industry is an important one, which we should never lose sight of in any fishing debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating you, Mrs Langenhagen, as rapporteur, and the Committee on Fisheries for this own initiative report. Like the European Parliament, the Commission also sees the European fish-processing industry as an important sector of the economy. This sector of the economy supplies quality fish products and creates jobs, especially in regions which depend on fisheries, and we are well aware of the challenges which it has to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four main problem areas. First, the inadequate supply of raw materials from EU waters, secondly, import restrictions on raw materials, thirdly, strict health, hygiene and environmental standards in the EU compared with third countries and, fourthly, increasing international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the individual points in your report. You complain that we have forgotten this industry in our Green Paper. May I remind you that it is addressed in our structural policy, especially in items 4 to 7, 14 and 22 and have already supported measures to modernise the European fish-processing industry. The structural fund for fisheries has earmarked EUR 637 million for this purpose for the period from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly agree, however, that we need the results of the study into the impact of structural funds on the sector as quickly as possible. This study will be available in time for the interim review of the structural fund period in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the supply situation. I fully agree that we need to develop our supply policy. In the final analysis, it is the competitiveness of our own processing industry which is at stake. We shall submit a proposal along these lines before the end of this year. I expressly welcome your call for the liberalisation of port services in the EU to be harmonised to promote fair competition in the processing industry. The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on this in May last year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of health, hygiene and consumer protection inside and outside the Community, I should like to remind you that the relevant provisions of Community law obviously also apply to imports from third countries and we have a comprehensive inspection programme in place in the Member States and third countries in order to ensure that this is the case. We want to improve these controls still further and the relevant provisions are being revised as we speak. In addition, the European Food Safety Agency will provide us with substantiated scientific opinions on food and animal food safety in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question closely related to that of consumer protection is labelling, which was set on a new legal basis in last year's new regulation and which also applies to a whole range of processed products, including smoked, dried and frozen fish.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as preparations for enlargement are concerned, the SAPARD and PHARE programmes include measures to ensure that candidate countries quickly come up to our standards in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the new common organisation of the market makes greater provision for cross-sectoral producer organisations which allow the various industries in the fisheries sector, from fishing to processing and sales, to make use of their common synergy potential, for example, by adapting products to market requirements, improving product quality, developing quality labels or environmentally-friendly production methods and so on. So you see, we have already addressed certain aspects of your initiative, although much still remains to be done and you may be sure that we shall put your proposals into practice as best we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
