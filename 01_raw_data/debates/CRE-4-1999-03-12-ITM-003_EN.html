<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenmarck </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur. – (SV)</span> Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs McIntosh, who has produced a substantial and important piece of work in this report, unfortunately cannot be here today. She has therefore asked me to present the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the basic consideration which one must focus on when dealing with a matter such as this is that the shipping industry in the EU is currently having a very difficult time. It is up against increasingly harsh competition from other countries. The ferry operators, for example, either immediately this summer or in a few years' time in the event of a postponement, are faced with the abolition of duty‐free trading and hence the loss of a substantial portion of their revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission emphasises the importance of free access to shipping markets throughout the world, along with the need to raise quality standards and to maintain or increase competition. The Commission can also show that considerable progress has been made in these areas. At the same time, however, working conditions for seafarers in the Union have deteriorated and employment is showing a consistently downward trend. All this is the result of flagging‐out, manning reductions and cheaper labour from third countries. These developments have hitherto hit the freight sector hardest, but could also spread to the passenger sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is concerned to devise a Community policy which will both remove the incentive for flagging‐out and harmonise market conditions for seafarers. Hence the Commission's first proposal under which the regulation on cabotage would be amended to provide for crews from third countries to be placed on an equal footing with seafarers from the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal concerns the manning of vessels in regular passenger and ferry traffic. On the matter of working conditions as well, the Commission is seeking equal treatment irrespective of whether the crew members are resident in a Member State or not.</p>
<p class="contents">There are grounds for misgivings as to some of the Commission's proposals. First of all, the question is prompted whether the time is right, having regard to all the problems that shipping is already facing in the EU. The proposed directives on cabotage have given rise to concern in the industry, since they amount to direct intervention on the labour market, which many see as running directly counter to free trade in goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aims the Commission seeks to achieve is to create equal conditions for competitors within the EU. In actual fact, working conditions vary greatly from one Member State to another. It is therefore also difficult to see the effect of the proposed measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion on this is that it is difficult for the moment to see any acceptable reason why the regulation on passenger traffic should be amended. The present version expires in the year 2001. It should be added that the Commission has itself already proposed voluntary changes; that happened, for example, in a report which was presented in 1995. The rapporteur therefore proposes that we should not make any change in this part before the Commission has examined what effects the liberalisation of passenger and ferry traffic will have.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 proposes that the economic and social consequences of the liberalisation of cabotage should be reviewed and a report submitted to the Council and Parliament at the latest by 1 January 2001. On the basis of this report, the Commission should then present proposals on a definitive system.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the directive on manning, efforts should be concentrated on areas other than those the Commission addresses. If we want to increase the competitiveness of the entire industry, the first concern should be to promote training and know‐how in the maritime sector, something the Transport Committee has taken up in other contexts too. The rapporteur has developed this in Amendment No 8.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by just saying that the rapporteur takes a positive view of all the amendments proposed, with the exception of Amendment No 7.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Simpson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, earlier this week Parliament had an in‐depth discussion about the future of Europe's railways, and today gives us the opportunity to do the same in regard to intra‐European Union shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur, Miss McIntosh, for her work. I am sorry she cannot be with us here today – no doubt it is due to other commitments in another house. I should also like to say that her initial ideas, based on Conservative Party dogma, were not relevant, nor indeed helpful. However, she has changed her mind on that and we now have a more balanced, more pro‐European report as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">This report deals with manning levels on intra‐EU services and on cabotage. I am going to confine my remarks to the manning proposals, as it appears, sadly, that within the Council the cabotage issue is dead and buried.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it must be said that these proposals deal with intra‐EU and not deep‐sea services. Secondly, my Group believes that action has long been overdue because of the increase in use recently of non‐EU seafarers to crew those vessels at wage rates and conditions of service well below accepted EU levels. In short, EU shipowners have started to introduce flags of convenience in this sector, just as they have done previously on deep‐sea operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be congratulated on taking action early in the sector to ensure that, where third‐country nationals are employed on intra‐EU services, they are employed on the same conditions as our EU seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be totally honest with the House this morning. I should like to see a directive which states that only EU seafarers must be used on intra‐EU services. However, I recognise that this is not possible, which is why our Group supports the principle of having the same conditions of service for those non‐EU seafarers. We cannot let our ferry operators, in particular, become cheap‐labour, lower‐standard employers. If we do this, then we sign the final death warrant for European Union seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this report is important; that is why it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament send a message very clearly and very loudly to European ferry operators: we will not tolerate non‐EU seafarers being employed on lower wages and conditions than our own people.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hatzidakis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the Commission rightly points out that there is a problem in the Community maritime sector as regards the decline of the seafaring profession and unemployment in the sector. This situation is mainly due to the introduction of flag changes, to austerity measures and to cheaper manpower from third countries. The cargo services sector seems to have been hit the hardest by these changes, but it seems that passenger services and ferry services may also be affected. That is why, in the two reports we are debating, a number of measures have been proposed which attempt to address the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The intentions of the Commission are essentially well‐meaning, but two objections need to be raised. First of all, given that the directives cover all vessels which belong to the European Union but which are registered outside the Community, and given that there are maritime areas between Member States which are regarded as international waters, many questions arise as to the compatibility of the directive with the international commitments of the European Union and its Member States and with international law and international conventions. We need to be very careful on this score. Secondly, although the aim of the directive is to protect employment, it is not at all certain that in the end we will achieve this goal. The difficulties that will be faced by the regular ferry services as a result of the abolition of duty‐free cannot be overcome by unified conditions of employment. The proposal may go some way to putting a stop to the use of cheap labour, but it will not protect the sustainability of the services or employment. In the end, it may not help our own seafarers, which must be our fundamental objective. Let us not forget that many shipping companies are companies with a broad popular base, and therefore the motivation behind our reasoning must be to strengthen the competitiveness of these companies, since only in this way will we be able to serve the interests of our seafarers.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wijsenbeek </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that although Mr Stenmarck has done an extremely good job of standing in for Mrs McIntosh, it seems a pity that she herself has not been able to present her last report in the House. I agree with the rapporteur that maritime transport is indeed going through hard times, not just because it faces fierce competition, but also because it is a sector that has really dug its own grave by persisting in its old ways for far too long. The abolition of duty‐free has absolutely nothing to do with it, Mr Stenmarck, let us be quite clear on that point. It is about time that all the fuss about duty‐free stopped and the maritime sector got on with things like everybody else. Duty‐free still exists outside the Community, and that is bad enough.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the problem? The problem is a serious social one. Contrary to what everyone thinks, ship"s captains and officers are not really very well paid, and these days no one wants to spend a long time away from home without a break. This is why there are no European crews any more, and it also means that the infrastructure is collapsing. The nautical colleges are disappearing, which is jeopardising maritime safety. We have seen many examples of this, such as in your own country, Mr President, where the only tug available was manned by Chinese and a Chinese restaurant owner had to be fetched to communicate with them. Generally there are not enough European crews available and we have to do something about this. We need to improve the social conditions for the entire crew, and in particular for the officers.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, on the occasion of the debate on the amendment of Council Regulation No 3577/92, I would like to say that we think it essential to highlight the negative impact that the relaxation of cabotage has had on the employment of maritime workers in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">For countries like Greece in particular, the relaxation of cabotage for passenger, cargo and ferry services in domestic waters is closely associated with sovereign rights and with the ability of the country to defend itself in the particularly sensitive area of the Aegean. It also exacerbates social problems such as procurement, the development of small and peripheral islands, and maintaining island populations. Moreover, it is giving rise to significant concerns about the new, immediate and extremely serious threat of the prospect of thousands of job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has failed to draw the necessary conclusions from the current implementation of the Council regulation on the relaxation of cabotage. Without first conducting a necessary and substantial impact study, it is proceeding to amend it, thereby further aggravating the situation. With this proposal, the Commission is aiming to limit the competence of the host state to determining the required proportion of Community nationals in the crew, while all other matters relating to manning will be the responsibility of the flag state. Vital issues such as the integrated structure and conditions of work and pay are to be decided on the basis of the flag state"s legislation. This will mean segregating the crew into those who are included in the integrated structure by being listed on the ship"s register, and those who are not. It will also encourage practices of social dumping and will have a catastrophic impact on employment. By way of example, in certain European countries hotel staff, chambermaids, cooks and so on are not included in the employment structure, and therefore, in the name of equal conditions of competition, shipowners in Greece are demanding that this should be extended to ships flying the Greek flag. All issues relating to manning levels must be decided in a uniform manner by the host state. Against this background, we support the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is calling for the proposals in question to be rejected. We also support the request for a study to be carried out into the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of cabotage.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal for a directive on manning conditions, it is clear that all seafarers have a right to equal treatment, regardless of their nationality. However, we are categorically opposed to the derogations put forward in the report, since these essentially allow for the circumvention of these provisions through the possibility of exemptions and waivers provided for in Article 3, which the report unfortunately accepts. Moreover, we believe that equal treatment must include not just conditions of employment, but must also cover working and safety conditions, pay and the implementation of collective bargaining agreements for the whole of the crew. Against this background, therefore, we must put an end to any derogations which are negotiated through bilateral agreements which are often concluded with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism accepts the proposal, it does not call for the amendment of those articles which lead to its circumvention. Its assessment is based on the argument of non‐intervention in the labour market, which does not dispel the concern about the trend of using cheap labour from third countries. Specifying the conditions for the employment of third‐country nationals, which must be the same as the conditions applying to residents of the Member State which is the flag state, does not however deal with the problem of undeclared, uninsured work. The rapporteur has made a very laudable effort, but we cannot agree with her on this point. Undermining the provisions will lead to undeclared work and to unemployment among Community seafarers.</p>

In the first section on the conditions for cabotage within a Member State, it is proposed that each member of the crew should be paid the same, irrespective of origin. This is designed to prevent social dumping, sailing with crews that are cheaper to employ than European workers. However, I do not think this will cost many EU nationals their jobs, since 95 % of the crews on the vessels concerned are EU nationals anyway, mainly doing maritime work, whereas the non‐EU nationals on the same vessels are mainly in non‐maritime jobs. So there is hardly any competition between the two groups.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means that the increase in costs for the shipowners applies only to a small number of workers. The increase in labour costs as a result of this measure is almost completely offset by the income from duty‐free. I cannot see why people doing the same job should be paid different wages just because they are a different nationality, so there is every reason to agree with the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal on manning conditions for ferry services between Member States extends the scope of these conditions to shipping companies established outside the European Union. Under the relevant international conventions, only the port state can apply safety measures on board and more especially in the proximity of the vessel. So as far as I can tell, the Commission proposal goes further than is actually possible at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I agree with the substance of the rapporteur"s Amendment No 4, but I do not think that this directive is the right place to address this issue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasio </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the Commission deserves thanks for compiling its report, and thanks also go to the rapporteur for having brought out the importance and significance of the issue from the point of view of both employment and the future of shipping. Every day an enormous number of people travel on passenger craft and ferries in the EU Member States, and their safety relies on professional expertise in the various tasks that are carried out on board by employees who can be entrusted with serious responsibilities. An important factor here is that the pay and other working conditions of those employed in navigation should be in line with those of other occupations. The Commission"s proposals tackle that very issue, and the European Parliament today has the opportunity to make its own important contribution to the final decision to be taken. Using an unskilled and underpaid workforce to gain a competitive edge in shipping is a threat both to EU employment policy and transport safety. There are, however, calls far and wide to outlaw this improper competitive practice. The issue now to be discussed shows the European Union"s resolve to counter this negative development.</p>
<p class="contents">Safeguarding and improving employment is one of the most important obligations the European Union has taken upon itself; many would say it is the most important. All the institutions have expressed the will to tackle this issue, but often the problem has been that it has been hard to find practical ways of achieving this aim at Union level. There has been conflict when such great emphasis has been placed on the importance of the employment objectives, yet responsibility for employment is ultimately the responsibility of the Member States. Now the matter to be resolved is a practical example of employment policy being put into practice at Union level, and, in addition, it includes a sizeable element devoted to the issue of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the EU develops and enlarges as a community in which market forces play the role that befits them, that is, one that is in the service of the people, and not one that dominates everyone and everything. As markets become globalised, the European Union will perhaps be the main player, able to influence the framework for imposing conditions on the market within the context of the democratic decision‐making process. We must, in our own work, see to it that the Union fulfills that task. We need a market economy, but not a market dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">There is reason to hope that the Commission and all the legislative machinery that evolves out of its initiative in the future will create regulations allowing us to live and travel safely in a Europe where our citizens earn their livelihood under the protection of a modern system of collective bargaining. With regard to that, I wish to emphasise the importance of the trade unions, whose job is especially important now in the maritime sector when it comes to increasing safety standards for the public.</p>

This will be the case if cheap labour is able to be exploited freely in EU shipping. As the previous speaker said, it is also a matter of safety. There are very many examples of problems: ships capsize, as for example the Estonia did, in the Baltic Sea, and others catch fire. In these situations we need staff who have language skills, who are knowledgeable when it comes to local conditions, and who can rescue people from disaster. This is why we cannot have a situation where the safety of navigation is under threat all because of cheap labour. All these rules are positive, in the same way as the continuation of duty‐free shopping would serve this purpose in the Nordic countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I welcome Miss McIntosh"s report which supports the adoption of the proposal for a Council directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, albeit in her absence, for her excellent work on such an important and complex subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to two of the amendments proposed. It can accept the substance of Amendment No 1, provided that it is put into an appropriate article on definitions, since it is in favour of excluding exclusively cargo services from the scope of the directive. I would point out here that the Commission is currently carrying out a study of the directive"s economic impact, as requested by various delegations in the Council. The scope of the directive may therefore be defined in greater detail in the light of the results of the study, which will be submitted to the Council in April.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 5 is concerned, the Commission can accept it on condition that the deadline for submission of the report is given.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now move on to the amendments which the Commission cannot accept. Amendment No 2 cannot be accepted as employment contracts are by definition individual contracts and cannot therefore be included in the article in question, where they would be placed alongside universally applicable instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 cannot be accepted as the right to allow seafarers to reside permanently on board ships, or to prohibit them from so doing, is not a matter which is internationally regulated. Just because he provides regular ferry services does not give a seafarer the right to reside in a Member State, and the Commission does not intend to interfere in an area which would cause problems regarding residence rights in the European Union. Of course this is without prejudice to any decisions which may be adopted under the second and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 cannot be accepted as the directive deals exclusively with the treatment of third‐country seafarers working on regular passenger and ferry services between Member States, and is therefore not the appropriate context in which to make such a proposal. In actual fact, the Commission is in the process of drawing up a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the recruitment and training of seafarers in the European Union, which will assess what actions might be undertaken to encourage young people to enter the maritime professions and to promote quality training. It will also examine how the education and training of seafarers are funded in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal for a Council regulation, I note with regret that the rapporteur has departed from the Commission"s proposal and has opted instead for an alternative text requiring the Commission to submit a proposal for a definitive system of manning rules by 1 January 2003. Such a proposal would have to be based on the report on the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of island cabotage, which is to be submitted to the Council and Parliament by 1 January 2001. The Commission cannot agree to such amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 June 1997, the Commission adopted a report which among other matters dealt with the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of island cabotage. The report concluded that in such a labour‐intensive sector as passenger and ferry services, a proposal allowing Member States to impose a compulsory quota of Community nationals in crews would be enough to properly safeguard the jobs of European Union seafarers and would also enable the internal market to operate on the basis of Community social provisions. The report also concluded that in the cargo cabotage sector, which is linked up to international traffic and is less labour‐intensive, there are not sufficient grounds to justify continuing to apply the host State"s rules, as is the case at present. In the proposed regulation an extra clause has been added which requires the host State to apply its own provisions on working conditions to third‐country seafarers providing such services and employed on board ships flying its flag. The European Parliament asks for the regulation not to be amended before the assessment of the impact of island cabotage is complete. We should remember that as far as manning conditions are concerned, the provisions of the flag State normally apply to shipping companies; under the terms of the regulation in its present form, the host Member States can impose all their own rules on manning conditions, including rules on the minimum wage, qualifications required and social security for seafarers, as well as provisions on working time, rest periods, holidays and so on. This amounts to a major and unjustified restriction of the freedom to provide services, as shipping companies from other Member States have to comply with the various requirements even when just carrying out a single cabotage operation. Various companies have already written to the Commission voicing their concern about this. On the basis of the legislation which is currently in force, it seems likely that the impact of liberalisation will be slight indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that its own proposal offers a balanced solution which can effectively guarantee freedom to provide services as well as safeguarding Community seafarers" jobs on passenger services between the Member States of southern Europe, which is a highly labour‐intensive sector. At the same time, it enables the restrictions which would arise from the enforcement of all the host State"s rules to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for helping to ensure the swift adoption of the common position on these important measures, which will enable us to get rid of social dumping thanks to the application of Community employment rules to third‐country nationals working on regular services, which as we have said are highly labour‐intensive.</p>
