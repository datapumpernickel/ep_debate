<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is, for me, a much longed-for day. As long ago as the middle of 1999, I was appointed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as rapporteur for the second reading of the directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services. We in Parliament were conscious of the urgency of this directive. We wanted to be prepared at any time for the common position. We then had to wait almost three years, however, hoping that the many attempts by several presidencies would at some point prove successful and that the Council would be able to come up with a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">If I now propose that Parliament make only minimal changes to the Council common position, then I do so not because the long wait for the common position has worn me down but because I am deeply convinced that the Council common position is a good compromise and that the Council has moved a long way from its original starting point and done a lot to accommodate Parliament and its objections to the content of the draft directive, raised at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for the first reading, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. I think that her report has significantly improved upon the draft directive. Many of her changes also had to be adopted by the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement forming part of my report, I provided a very comprehensive list of the points on which the directive has now been changed following the first reading in Parliament. I should like here just to list a few important points, as follows. The relationship to the directive on electronic commerce was clarified. The relationship to the Brussels II Regulation and the Rome Convention was clarified. The text might perhaps have been further improved, but the relationship is now clear from a legal point of view. The directive applies to all consumers. The restriction to consumers ‘resident in the territory of the Community’, criticised by Parliament at first reading, has been dropped. The list of information to be provided prior to the conclusion of the contract – a central point in the directive – includes all the points called for by Parliament and, in some cases, goes further than the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">As a lawyer, I have attached particular importance to the fact that the compulsory cooling-off period originally provided for has been dropped. The right of withdrawal is now a general right and does not now exist only under specified conditions. The directive provides for a period of fourteen days. Previously, in the Commission’s draft, it had been seven, whereupon Parliament requested thirty. These fourteen calendar days seem acceptable, however. The consequences of withdrawal have also been determined in line with the European Parliament’s requests at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest discrepancies, here in Parliament too, naturally revolve around the issue of principle concerning whether we should harmonise on a maximum or minimum basis. This is, of course, not the first time that we are arguing in Parliament about these two principles. Albeit by a narrow majority, the European Parliament opted at first reading for the concept of maximum harmonisation. In the Council, there was, on the other hand, originally a very large majority in favour of the universal application of minimum harmonisation. If, in theory, maximum harmonisation now forms the basis of the common position and the Member States can only apply additional regulations in specific, precisely defined cases, that seems to me to be the only realistic compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In a legal environment in which, for example, we still do not have full harmonisation either in contract law or in the substantive European law governing financial services, no other decision can be made in this directive. If it is then to be determined upon whom, either the consumers or the suppliers, the risk of an alien legal system is to be imposed, I think it is still the consumer who has more difficulty bearing this risk, more difficulty, certainly, even than smaller suppliers. The directive now provides for a situation in which the risk borne by smaller suppliers and the costs incurred by them are reduced through the Commission’s providing them with information concerning additional stipulations in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to all those of my fellow MEPs who, through their amendments, have signalled that they are not prepared to compromise and are insisting that maximum harmonisation and the country of origin principle be put fully into effect, I should like, finally, to appeal to them also to consider what would happen if we were to end up in a conciliation procedure in which we would probably not succeed in finding this politically very sensitive and very elusive balance. In the end, we might possibly have no directive, and we should then be in the situation in which we are at present, in which the country of destination principle directly applies. We should then be very far, in terms both of content and of timescales, from the goals which, both independently and in conjunction with the Commission, we have set ourselves in the Financial Services Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would therefore again appeal to you possibly to withdraw further amendments by way of a compromise or, as far as possible, to refrain from agreeing to amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was important for him to attend the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that is taking place now. It is unfortunate that those clashes cannot be taken into account in scheduling these debates, because this is a major piece of legislation from our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Berger for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work and for being very persistent in presenting her arguments to us. It must be said that our group – and I hope many colleagues will agree with us – has tabled a number of crucial amendments to this directive. We believe they reflect the overall balance of opinion in this House about the importance of maintaining an entirely consistent approach to our work in this absolutely crucial area, and a consistent approach to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in the areas of electronic commerce and in creating the internal market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that we in this House have been entirely consistent. It is the Commission and the Council that have moved away from the direction that my colleague Mrs Oomen-Ruijten established at first reading. In the e-commerce directive we established the principle of country of origin as being crucial to e-commerce transactions. In our work on distance marketing of financial services, where we robustly supported the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we followed that line as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole project of creating a single market – an internal market for financial services – is one of the most important projects we are working on at the moment in terms of meeting the Lisbon objectives and creating the sort of dynamic economy that we must have across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The distance marketing of financial services directive does not just apply to e-commerce but is crucial in terms of moving to a single cross-border market. But what do we find? We find in the proposal from the Council that the 15 Member States will be able to vary requirements on two crucial elements: prior information given to consumers and aspects of the right to withdrawal from contracts. What sort of single market will we create? What sort of signal will we be sending to the Council and to the market outside if we accept a proposal from the Council that allows 15 different sets of conditions to go forward?</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest to you – and I hope this House will take forward our recommendations – that when we vote tomorrow we should not accept this compromise. It is not satisfactory. Conciliation is the only way to resolve it, but we must be consistent with the principles of this House. I ask you, on behalf of the group, to support those amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the directive is to set up a single legal framework for distance marketing of consumer financial services by supplementing existing sectoral regulations and plugging the gaps in the general directive on distance marketing of consumer goods.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will improve the working of the single market and offer consumers greater protection. The question of maximum or minimum harmonisation is still a bugbear and naturally voices have been raised in disagreement. My impression is that the problem could be resolved by adopting or at least allowing for specific regulations to be adopted on certain matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Maximum harmonisation, taken together with the Commission's obligation to tell providers about various national regulations is helpful in a way, especially to small and medium-sized financial service providers, because it cuts providers' information costs and increases transparency. This principle has also been retained on the important issue of the right of withdrawal, with the exception of life insurance and old-age pensions. The 14-day period represents a compromise between the seven days initially proposed by the Commission and the 30 days for which Parliament lobbied. There are also uniform rules on the method for calculating such periods. This uniform approach to the right of withdrawal reinforces transparency and legal security in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">One crucial point which needs to be highlighted is that the common position clarifies the fact that this directive needs to take account of Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce, at least as far as the transactions regulated by it are concerned. I think that recognition of the country of origin is vital and should not be overlooked. In all events, despite its remaining shortcomings, the common position will fortunately go a long way towards satisfying the positions of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the directive should apply immediately, which is why we need to avoid time-consuming amendments to individual regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Beysen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Berger, whom I should like to thank for the large amount of work she has done, has once again clearly regenerated the traditional fight in this Parliament for more or less harmonisation. It might be useful to remind ourselves of the fact that in the original Commission proposal, maximum harmonisation was very much the main objective in terms of distance marketing of financial services. The Council, on the other hand, took a completely different view.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, a great deal can be said for the Commission’s original position. It was undoubtedly the best solution, both for providers of financial services and for the consumer. The division in Parliament, however, makes it impossible to secure this best solution. Moreover, in its common position, the Council would like to introduce exceptions to the principle of maximum harmonisation. This is unfortunate, for national provisions can indeed constitute barriers to the establishment of the internal market. Only complete harmonisation guarantees equal competitive conditions between the institutions and instils consumer confidence in services that are offered by other Member States. The exceptions to the principle of complete harmonisation can seriously hinder <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce because service providers are thus obliged to take account of provisions enshrined in the fifteen different legal systems. I should also like to emphasise that the principle concerning the right of the country of origin will on the whole apply when there is no complete harmonisation. This will be extremely detrimental to some institutions because the legislations are very different in the area of restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I can therefore state that maximum harmonisation is still the preferred solution, but it once again appears that politics is the art of the possible.

I would now just mention here that any directive, for example, in response to Parliament’s demands, would apply to all consumers and not only those that live in the Member States. Furthermore, the demands for information that service providers must make available correspond very closely to Parliament’s demands, and this and other things mean I am quite prepared, on behalf of my group, to appeal to Parliament not to commence legislative conciliation regarding this matter but adopt this common position, which in many respects is very satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be said that we have now made a good start with regard to guaranteeing consumer protection in the internal market in financial services, and we can definitely go further in this at a later date. It is quite proper that the principle of minimum harmonisation is now being applied. That provides a guarantee that, as no Community act has yet been introduced to cover all the issues and considerations involved, Member States may deviate from it and go a little further. I do not believe that the internal market will come to any particular harm as a result. The cross-border sale of financial services is now definitely under way, and in the early stages this will represent a very good level of consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a course of events that baffles me. Why? Because it is not Parliament that has adopted different positions on different occasions, but because the European Commission and the Council have suddenly moved from maximum harmonisation to minimum harmonisation. And I would invite Mrs Hautala and Mr Beysen to change this topic too. Politics may be the art of the possible, but if this way of going about things does not benefit the financial services sector nor the consumers, then I think that we should make a different choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you another rundown of events, for you will then be able to judge for yourself. And I would ask you to bear with me. In May 1992, the draft directive on the marketing of financial services was submitted. This original draft included financial services; so it comprised all distance marketing plus financial services. This met with a great deal of resistance. Eventually, the common position was drafted, from which the financial services were deleted. This happened in 1995. The European Commission was in agreement with this. Parliament attempted at second reading to reverse this situation, but unfortunately lacked a few votes to do so. Then, a Green Paper was published in 1997. Parliament once again opted for incorporating financial services in this directive. We voted in favour of this. The Commission subsequently presented a draft directive in which it rightly proposed maximum harmonisation. Why maximum harmonisation? Because the consumer, wherever he may make his purchases in Europe, should be able to do so subject to the same rules, and must be given the same guarantees. Moreover, this also benefits the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">What transpired? In the common position, minimum harmonisation was all of a sudden opted for. This minimum harmonisation will create a great deal of frustration within the market, as fellow MEPs have already pointed out. I therefore call on you, all of us, to revisit very carefully the first reading of this proposal in Parliament – for which I happened to be rapporteur – and to vote on this proposal after all and also to present it to the Council after all. I have understood that the Council too may have changed its opinion in the mean time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is now before us, despite the heartfelt concern displayed by Mrs Berger, will, in my view, not lead to anything. And I have the feeling that a huge number of fellow MEPs, not only in this group, but also in other groups, will join me in voting out anything that is cloaked in minimum harmonisation, allowing us to start proper negotiations with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that Parliament will have the wisdom to stay close to and, to all intents and purposes, in line with the Council’s position. I feel that it is a sensible position and that we need it urgently. I do not share Mr Harbour’s point of view that conciliation would be the best path to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, we see further progress in the development of distance financial services, and we see the positive and negative effects of this in terms of cost to<span class="bold"> </span>the economy but also the risks to which consumers are exposed as a result. From this point of view, the common position adopted by the Council is sensible; I feel that it takes Parliament’s position into ample account and maintains a satisfactory balance in dealing with the principle of the country of origin, which enhances consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial point is clearly Article 3(4). I feel that, if Parliament were to upset the balance achieved by the Council, we would be doing more harm than good, if only because we would be delaying the potential entry into force of this urgently needed directive. The solution found concerns the potential conflict between pre-contractual information and the information contained in the contract, specifying that the pre-contractual information must comply with the provisions of the contract itself. This is a sensible requirement and we support it.</p>
<p class="contents">This article does not cover all pre-contractual information: it relates purely to the information regarding contractual obligations and its sole purpose is to ensure conformity between the two sets of information. Once again, this is a sensible step which we fully support.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that the Commission itself has fully acknowledged that the agreement achieved by the Council is compatible with the previous texts on <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. We support the Commission’s point of view, of course, and we trust that Parliament’s wisdom will prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and the Council have set themselves and Parliament the goal of creating a coherent legal framework for electronic commerce, which is intended, over the coming years, to substantially push forward the integration of Europe's financial markets and enhance the capacity of Europe's financial services sector to compete across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my – and our – opinion that this Common Position by the Council on the proposal for a directive on the distance marketing of financial services does insufficient justice to the endeavour to create a single European internal market. The great gulf between what we ask for and what is implemented is to the detriment of all parties concerned, including, I believe, the consumers. The objective that this proposal for a directive has in view – the guaranteeing of a high level of consumer protection in order to safeguard the free movement of financial services – means that the Member States should not be given the option of implementing other – perhaps more extensive – provisions in the areas harmonised by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give one reason why I call for this. Recognising the possibility of withdrawal from contracts with effect from the moment they are entered into is not compatible with the provision of immediate cover, which is much in demand on the part of customers in the field of non-life insurance. The regulation envisaged could have adverse effects<span class="italic"> </span>on the services on offer to consumers. An internal market requires harmonised regulations, and the objective must not be undermined by means of regulations which differ from one country to another. We therefore ask you to adopt our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much that has been said has been very much to the point, and, in order to avoid repeating it, I wish to limit myself to just one aspect of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt is being made to make consumer protection a reality principally by the means of two instruments, rights of cancellation being one and extensive requirements to provide information, advice and guidance the other. It is immediately apparent that consumers are protected by rights such as these. On the other hand, this does have its drawbacks – as must of course often be the case. Do consumers read the information? Do they take it on board? Do they understand it? Do they really cancel, or is it not possible that they are led by it to too free a use of their signatures and a consequent inability to extricate themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is in the interests of the business world and of the legal profession for contracts to be durable, and – to take the example Mr Karas has just given – their becoming immediately effective may be in the interests of the consumers themselves. The reason I say this is that, from these points of view, consumers are afforded better protection where provision is made for the statements they make to be authenticated by a notary. The procedure itself includes a warning in that the consumer has time to think things over, but, secondly, it involves advice from a third party, one outside the proceedings and obliged to be neutral, and, indeed liability if – as may of course happen – the right advice was not given. At the same time, though, it combines these points with the advantage of the durability of a deed or contract, and the provision of legal certainty. In these respects, as a whole, I see this as affording the consumer better protection where – as I have said – provision is made for this. That is of course not always possible, and certainly not in the day-to-day retail market. That is why, in my opinion, you should follow the principle that, where national legislation makes provision for consumer authentication, this must suffice, being the better way to protect consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, let me begin by confirming that the Commission supports the Council's common position and agreed with the original recommendation of your rapporteur, Mrs Berger, that Parliament should adopt the common position without amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we support the compromise amendments proposed by Mrs Berger and Mr Lehne – Amendments Nos 43 and 44 – and urge Parliament to adopt the common position with these amendments only. Let me pause here to record my thanks to Mrs Berger for the hard work that she has done on this particular piece of legislation, and also to Mr Lehne, for their cooperation and hard work with both myself and my services.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the common position constitutes a balanced solution which improves our amended proposal and, to a considerable extent, meets the wishes of Parliament as expressed in its first reading. In particular, the common position includes: fully harmonised and detailed general information requirements; the principle of written confirmation; a right of withdrawal with some exceptions; protection for the user on the chosen means of payment and redress in the event of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive complements and underpins the e-commerce directive by introducing an additional safety net of protection measures for consumers. This directive also fits into a larger framework of legislative measures designed to open up the internal market for retail financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment on the 50 amendments tabled. Let me begin by addressing Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11 and 37 that expressed Members' concerns about the position of intermediaries in this directive. In the common position, the supplier is defined only as the "contractual provider", and this is deliberate. Adding the concepts of "intermediary" and "agent" would require a precise outline of the operation of various categories of financial intermediaries and an exhaustive description of the relationship between suppliers and intermediaries or agents.</p>
<p class="contents">As indicated by recital 19, this is not possible in the framework of a general and horizontal directive that applies to all financial services. I can confirm that the intervention of a contractual provider face-to-face implies that the transaction falls outside the scope of the directive. The directive applies to organised distance marketing schemes not to face-to-face schemes with the occasional distance transaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address the amendments that are unacceptable because they attack the core of the common position. I shall begin by commenting on the alleged impact of Article 3(4) on the e-commerce directive and, in particular, the principle of country of origin. I fully agree with the speech made by Mrs Berès on this particular point earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission firmly believes that the common position establishes rules that complement the e-commerce directive and fill gaps in it. Among these, Article 3(4) is central. Amendment No 13 proposes deleting Article 3(4). The amendment is, in my view, based on a misinterpretation of the article. Article 3(4) provides indispensable clarification of an important aspect of the e-commerce directive. The article states that the information communicated to the consumer, prior to conclusion of the contract, needs to be consistent with the provisions which will be contained in the contract itself. This makes sense legally and in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Contractual obligations are not subject to the country of origin approach, and Article 3(4) simply refers to the law and I quote, "presumed to be applicable", normally meaning the law of the country of destination. No reputable supplier would willingly misinform consumers about the future content of their contract on the pretext that such information was subject to country of origin rather than country of destination rules. In addition, the article only covers the prior information which will eventually be reflected in the contract. It does not cover all the information provided before the contract is signed but not subsequently included in the contract itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the information contained in Article 3 must be communicated and addressed personally to the consumer. Situations where the supplier provides general information to an indefinite number of recipients are thus excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern is the wish to adopt a maximum level of harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 proposes the deletion of the content of recital 9; Amendment No 5, a substantial change to recital 13. Amendments Nos 26, 27 and 28 provide for the deletion of Article 4(2) to (4), and Amendment No 25 a fundamental change to Article 13. Again, I must disagree with these proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation period for the e-commerce directive expired in January this year. Once the distance selling directive has been adopted, there will still be a two-year implementation period. So for on-line transactions, the principle of country of origin will apply to generalised pre-contractual information for a time during which the provisions of this directive are being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be extremely unhelpful for consumer confidence if this period were to be perceived as leading to, or effectively did lead to, the lowering of consumer protection standards in any one Member State. To avoid this, recital 9 recalls that further convergence or harmonisation at a higher level of consumer protection is foreseen in a number of areas, as laid down in the Financial Services Action Plan. Pending this harmonisation, there should be no lowering of standards. The deletion proposed by Amendment No 5 would make the recital factually wrong. The directive in certain places, such as in Article 10, leaves Member States some leeway with the harmonised framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 4(2), introduces the possibility for Member States to impose additional information requirements. The Commission concluded from the inventory of information requirements it made in 2000, that this provision is inescapable. Information requirements in the area of financial services are of a diverse and complex nature, they are regulated partly by EC law, partly for the time being by national law. Much has been done at sectoral level to harmonise pre-contractual information requirements. However, it is clear that we are not yet in a position to base information obligations only on EC law.</p>
<p class="contents">Deletion of Article 4(2), as proposed in Amendment No 26 – although already rejected by the Committee on Legal Affair and the Internal Market – would prevent Member States from regulating information requirements, notably where no Community legislation existed at all and would in effect roll back important national consumer protection rules. For this reason, pending further harmonisation, Member States may maintain or introduce more stringent rules. However, the imposition of any additional rules must conform with the transparency procedure laid down in Article 4(3), which has to be maintained, contrary to the suggestions made in Amendments Nos 27 and 28.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 25 includes the deletion of the phrase at the end of Article 13 "where those operators are in a position to do so". This phrase is found in the equivalent article in the general directive. It is not a minimal clause, it is a reflection of the situation on the ground in all Member States. If it were to be deleted, postal service operators for instance could be obliged to breach mail secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is an exaggerated concern for the level of harmonisation to seek to transform the directive into a regulation as required by Amendment No 49 and to fix a date for end of transposition, even before the directive is adopted, as is suggested in Article 50.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 8 carve out contracts concluded before a notary. The consequence would be that intervention of a notary in a distance contract on financial services would deprive the consumer of central rights laid down in the directive, and this is clearly unacceptable. These rights include information that only the supplier can give, for instance on the quality and risk of a product, protection in case of fraudulent use of cards and protection against unsolicited services and communications. The effect of a mandatory exclusion of a right of withdrawal for mortgage credit, as contained in Amendments Nos 20, 22, 30 and 32, and the suppression of a right of reflection – Amendment No 31 – would be a substantial reduction of consumer protection in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the definition of mortgage credit found in Amendment No 20 is the same as the definition in the code of conduct on home loan information negotiated between industry and consumers in 2001, national legislation goes beyond the latter definition. Reduced consumer protection would also follow the suppression, through Amendment No 42, of the optional exemption to the obligation to pay for insurance services and the limits introduced by Amendment No 33.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments include provisions that are unacceptable simply because of their content. Amendment No 12 seeks to introduce a specific definition of credit. I understand this is to solve a problem with the transposition in one Member State of the general directive on distance contracts – Directive 97/7/EC. Any problems relating to the general directive should be resolved in that context and not in this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15 introduces a sunset provision: a deadline after which a consumer may no longer invoke the right of withdrawal. This would amount to punishing the consumer for disrespect of obligations by the supplier.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 17 would exclude from the right of withdrawal contracts whose performance has begun with the consumer's consent, before the end of the withdrawal period.</p>
<p class="contents">In the general directive on distance contracts (97/7/EC), the consumer loses his right of withdrawal. If he accepts that the performance of the contract begins. In contrast this directive foresees that if a consumer withdraws he must pay for services actually rendered before the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 17 would render Amendment No 7 meaningless. However, this would contradict the European Parliament's position during first reading, when it voted in favour of the principles contained in this article.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 23 on payment for services rendered confuses the respective obligations of consumers and suppliers. Consumers must pay for services rendered if they withdraw. A good example is an insurance contract. Suppliers must return any sums received before the consumer withdraws, for instance where the contract is for investments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not convinced of the need for Amendments Nos 24 and 48 on tacit renewal. The provision in Article 1(2), on initial services agreements, followed by successive operations or a series of separate operations of the same nature, amply covers the concern that underlines that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 35 makes the rules on burden of proof mandatory. This disregards the fact that the civil law of Member States is not harmonised. Article 46 removes the need to obtain the consumer's explicit consent to receive a shortened list of information requirements in telephone communications and replaces this by a reference to the rules on confirmation of information. This would lead to a substantial weakening of the consumer protection established by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have covered the most important amendments. The remaining amendments – Nos 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 29, 34, 36, 38 to 40, 45 and 47 – are either less precise than the common position or do nothing to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need to fill the gap and establish the legal certainty that this directive would offer. The directive has been negotiated since 1998. If it fails, neither business nor consumers will be better off. I urge you to follow the lead of your rapporteur and other speakers who urge this, and adopt this directive without any further delay, only with the compromise amendments suggested. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner has not in any way explained why he calls for maximum harmonisation four times over, but has instead taken fourteen minutes to tell us that a number of amendments that seek to establish exactly that, need not be adopted. He has not responded to what has been said here in the plenary session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
