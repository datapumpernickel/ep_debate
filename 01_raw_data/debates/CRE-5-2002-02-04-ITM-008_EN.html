<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vidal-Quadras Roca (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this crucial directive stems directly from the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply, which this House has recently debated at length. We are obviously all aware that the main component of the Union’s energy bill relates to buildings: ventilation, refrigeration, heating, lighting etc. It is within this chapter that most of the Union’s energy expenditure is concentrated. Therefore, anything that is done in this field has a special effect from this point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this framework directive marks the end of the era of expressions of will or recommendations. We are entering a new era of decisive commitments, binding actions and a firm will that this type of measure may become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to stress three aspects of the directive. The first is the obligation for all buildings in the Union to hold a certificate testifying to their energy efficiency. This certificate will certainly be of great value as a signal within the markets and will contribute significantly to energy saving. The second is the obligation for all new buildings to incorporate an energy-efficiency study as an essential requirement for planning permission. The third aspect is the obligation for all buildings of an area of greater than 1 000 m2 and which are subject to extensive renovation, to undergo an improvement of their energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other actions laid down in the directive, but I wanted to highlight these three because they are clearly the ones with the greatest potential. It will not escape you that if – as some studies suggest – it is possible to achieve a saving over the next few years of 20% in the energy bill for buildings, 20% of 40% brings us close to 10% and this, in terms of the oil bill and CO2 emissions, has an importance which is clear to all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is a good time to thank the other groups in the House for their valuable contribution and for their help in ensuring that Parliament’s amendments improve this important legislative text. I would like to thank the Socialist Group and Mrs Zrihen for their numerous contributions and, above all, I would like to stress their interesting suggestion in relation to social housing. I would also like to warmly thank the Group of the Greens and Mrs Ahern for showing such interest and cooperation, and also highlight their wonderful contribution in relation to passive cooling techniques, which are so important in those areas of the Union where the climate is very warm and cooling (air conditioning systems) begins to be a determining factor. I would also like to thank the Liberal Group for emphasising that tax incentives are always better than penalties. We say in Spanish that ‘more is gained by licking than by biting’, and this is also true in the economic field.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there are two points on which we have not been able to achieve unanimity in the House: firstly, the time limits for application of the directive, where we have opted for a reasonable midpoint between overly extended periods, which would render it ineffective, or overly strict demands, which would make it unviable. Secondly, the limit of 1 000 m2, which the Group of the Greens wanted to reduce. We understand their intention and we share their concern, but if we really want this directive to be implemented within a time scale which makes it effective, we must accept the figure proposed to us by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if it is the case that politics is the art of making the necessary possible, this directive will effectively guarantee that, in a very important chapter of the Union’s energy expenditure, there will over the coming decade be a huge saving which will contribute to the well-being, the progress and the security of all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he has pointed out, the European Union consumes more and more energy and therefore also imports more and more energy products, because our demand outweighs our capacity for supply by means of our own resources. It is therefore important firstly to diversify our sources of energy, by seeking new energy sources including, of course, renewable energy and furthermore we need to promote and pursue energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Mr Vidal-Quadras has taken a favourable view of the opinion of the Environment Committee, since I believe that the points which we have highlighted within it contribute to enriching some of the aspects of his excellent proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a key reference for increasing the Member States’ receptiveness to the proposal is that account should be taken of local climatic and special conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point on which the Environment Committee has insisted is the homogenisation of building certificates in the different Member States, which would allow for comparisons of the energy efficiency achieved in each building. We also wanted to define those buildings which are excluded from the application of energy-saving measures and, also, in order that our proposal is not rejected, we have proposed, like Mr Vidal-Quadras, that we accept the Commission’s proposal aimed at reducing the area of the buildings affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of this approach, Mr Vidal, like my committee, but I also understand your position. I believe that we will have to wait and see what the final result is and we will have to respect it. The important thing is that the directive should go ahead, Mr Vidal-Quadras. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that Mrs Zrihen, our socialist shadow, who unfortunately cannot be here this evening, appreciated the way in which he worked.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent, should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU, and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We as socialists are very supportive of the amendments put forward by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and others. The rapid growth of air conditioning needs to be taken into account more, the possibilities open to Member States in the form of inducements should be clarified, and many of the definitions need to be tightened.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that Mrs Zrihen wanted to make was that the surface area definitions must be re-examined over the next four years. It could well be that this directive is insufficiently ambitious and that it should also apply to much smaller surface areas. We ask the Commission to prepare for a reduction if that proves necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I once again thank Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and the Commission. We look forward to more directives as promised by the Commissioner in this important area of energy efficiency, of energy intelligence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I have tabled amendments to that effect. I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group. We live in hope, and perhaps a review is the best way forward, as Mrs McNally indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Many provisions of this directive have already been envisioned in the SAVE directive in 1993. We should now proceed to give it teeth. As I said, I would have liked to have seen stronger teeth here, but we need legally binding measures – which I believe we have – which will begin a process of really ensuring that we deal strongly with energy saving in the European Union.</p>

I hasten to add that it is a technical interest and not a financial one.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving the energy performance of buildings, however it is defined, is the most difficult issue that I have ever had to grapple with. Therefore my sympathy, to some extent, is with the rapporteur in being presented with an issue of this complexity. In the UK we have too many organisations trying to improve matters. At the European level we have a certain confusion of objectives. Are we trying to save energy? Are we trying to reduce CO2 emissions, or are we trying to reduce energy consumption? These are not all the same things. It is energy consumption that we should be focusing on. In my experience it is the existing buildings that are the key to our success. If you look at the housing sector, the most difficult area is rented accommodation rather than the owner-occupied sector. We are a long way from solving that one.</p>
<p class="contents">In general I support the Commission's proposals and the report, but I have some hesitation about Amendment No 15. We should be focusing more on the common methodology rather than worrying too much at this stage about minimum standards applying right across the whole of the Community. We are really a long way from being able to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have some reservations about including a CO2 emission indicator. If you take a house, it depends on how much gas is being used or how much electricity. Therefore you cannot compare them very easily. But it is a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are now discussing is energy efficiency. In his report, the rapporteur has done well to highlight a series of measures that will contribute to increased efficiency where energy use is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to consider both large and small measures. All in all, there is a very great deal to be done when it comes both to greater conservation of resources and to the development of different techniques. If the necessary objectives are to be achieved, political initiatives are required that include both legislation and measures that act as a stimulus. The whole of society must share responsibility for these efforts. That applies both to companies and individuals, both to public and private enterprises and both at European and national and local levels. How we solve energy issues will naturally affect our comfort and prosperity, but also our future living environment in the broad sense of the word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca on his excellent work on the proposed directive concerning the energy performance of buildings. I should also like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its thorough and thoughtful discussions and to express my satisfaction with the way in which the debate in Parliament has sharpened the focus of the proposal and strengthened it. It will very likely be one of our most important means of meeting the European Union's Kyoto commitment and of improving our security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, the buildings sector accounts for over 40% of all EU final energy consumption. It also has a very large cost-effective savings potential. This proposal may lead to a significant improvement in the energy performance of buildings by promoting better minimum standards in Member States and in their building codes and by requiring more frequent updating and wider application of these codes. Not only would this apply to new buildings but, as has been said this evening, even more importantly to many existing buildings when they undergo major renovations. That is where the real potential for improvement lies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament's report and the proposed changes that will serve to improve, clarify and strengthen the proposal. Many amendments do this by enhancing the technical and financial definitions, giving concrete examples and defining the proposal's scope and implementation more exactly. For example, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, 36 and 37 are amendments the Commission can accept, many as they are, some with minor redrafting. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 encourage the use of subsidy schemes and incentives to promote the implementation of the proposal, taking into account socio-economic implications, and are thus also acceptable. Amendments Nos 7 and 22, on individual metering and billing and authorisation of inspectors respectively, can also be accepted if their financial and legal implications are illuminated more clearly in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Adam mentioned Amendment No 15. That is a comprehensive amendment, parts of which are acceptable to the Commission. The setting of efficiency levels at Community level is, however, not yet feasible. Amendments Nos 18 and 20 are also acceptable in parts, bearing in mind the need to allow CO2 indicators to remain optional.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21 and 27 are not acceptable to the Commission for technical and definitional reasons, including the degree of detail or because of related problems of subsidiarity that would result for example from the setting of efficiency levels at Community level. Because of the heterogeneous nature of the building sector as a result of differences in climate, culture and building traditions, subsidiarity and flexibility for Member States are important in the implementation of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that the most effective way to improve energy performance requirements in Member States is to provide methods to encourage them to improve their own building codes, set their own performance levels and ensure full application and regular revision of those.</p>
<p class="contents">While methods of calculation, many norms and a number of standards can be established at Community level, the actual efficiency level of energy performance of buildings should remain a Member State matter. Most of the amendments proposed take these principles into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is with regard to the threshold for upgrading the energy performance of existing buildings when they undergo major renovation. Upgrading existing buildings is an important part of this proposal. For many Member States it represents a new area of endeavour which will require new performance standards, new resources and substantial investment. We feel that the proposed threshold of 1 000 m2 for upgrading is therefore the best possible compromise attainable at this early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the period for transposition of this directive we feel that it is important to underline that we should avoid an unnecessarily long period if we are to meet the target date for Kyoto which is usually set at between 2008 and 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
