<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from a humanitarian point of view the situation in Kosovo is still, in our opinion, an out‐and‐out disaster. Estimates of the number of displaced persons within Kosovo are now up to 850 000, according to NATO. Interviews with displaced persons by the OSCE"s KVM representatives and the United Nations, and also national interviews such as by the German armed forces in the camps, paint a shocking picture of mass executions, rape, plundering and the systematic destruction of Kosovar Albanian houses and property. This weekend saw a new round of expulsions on a large scale, particularly from Prizren, where there is a danger of the whole town being expelled under threat of the most horrific acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the situation in Albania and Macedonia, it is quite obvious that the expulsion of the Kosovar Albanian population by means of the most brutal violence in order to dictate the ethnic and demographic composition of the population of Kosovo is not only a criminal war objective but also pursues a second criminal aim: that of destabilising the neighbouring countries and thus the entire region. According to UNHCR figures, a total of 670 000 displaced persons from Kosovo are now in the countries bordering on it; of these approximately 400 000 are now in Albania, 200 000 in Macedonia, and approximately 60 000 in Montenegro. On Saturday a further influx of over 10 000 people arrived in Albania and a slightly smaller number arrived in Macedonia. Above all, the situation is particularly unstable in political terms. Macedonia is a multi‐ethnic state in which the composition of the population has direct political consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">EU aid, both bilateral and Community aid, plays an important role in coping with the refugee crisis. What is important here is not just material assistance but also the reception of refugees by the Member States. We now have such a disastrous situation in Albania and Macedonia that there is no longer any question about whether the people should remain in the region or be taken in by third countries. In view of the humanitarian disaster triggered by Milosevic and his inhumane policies, both are needed. I would therefore appeal to you, the European Parliament, Members of this House, to call upon your countries either to start taking refugees or to increase their quotas where possible. Macedonia in particular needs urgent help here. We also have a political interest in ensuring that Macedonia remains stable. We must not allow Milosevic"s strategy of destabilising neighbouring countries to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the further political process, we are actively pursuing the strategy of maintaining pressure on Belgrade, pressure that should ensure the implementation of the five point plan which the European Union was the first international organisation to agree, and which was subsequently adopted by NATO and also by the UN Secretary‐General as a basis for his own position. These points are: the return of all displaced persons, the return of all refugees, acceptance of an international peace‐keeping force to ensure a secure environment for the return of refugees, on the basis of a UN Chapter VII resolution with a NATO core and a high level of NATO participation, but also with the participation of Russia, Ukraine and neutral countries, and the simultaneous withdrawal of military and paramilitary forces and of the special police force of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia. This forms the core of what NATO and the Western allies are currently fighting for. Any agreement that did not include the return of displaced persons would mean that Milosevic had imposed his will. The displaced persons will not return as long as the murderers in the region are still in charge. That is absolutely certain. For this reason it will be up to an international peace‐keeping force to ensure their safe return.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that it is very much in the interest of all the countries bordering on Kosovo, of all neighbouring countries, whether directly or indirectly affected, that lasting stability should be restored in the southern Balkans. This is why, in contrast to what we did after Dayton when a cease‐fire had already been achieved, we must make urgent preparations for a conference to find solutions in order to achieve a stability pact for the southern Balkans. We – the West, the European Union – must use this stability pact to bring this region of Europe closer to our Europe of integration. We must not forget that this is a part of Europe that will pose huge security problems for the future of Europe if we do not take this bold step.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Kosovo makes one thing clear, and here I would like to quote the last speech made by François Mitterrand in this House: nationalism means war, that is Europe"s experience. The idea of a Europe of integration was formed to fight this nationalist Europe with its dreadful experiences. I cannot emphasise this too strongly, and this is why we must give a long‐term commitment to bring this region of the southern Balkans closer to our Europe of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">All neighbouring countries, all countries bordering on Kosovo, with the exception of Milosevic, want three things: they want internal democracy, and they want to secure this by means of external security within NATO and by means of economic development within the European Union. We must try to meet these expectations by developing a type of stability pact incorporating three elements. The most important will be to guarantee the inviolability of borders. I would also like at this stage to make a preliminary remark: rather than making abstract academic decisions about where borders should be, who can and cannot live with whom, it is more important that we implement rules – under the rule of law – and reject the rule of violence and weapons. These rules must be guaranteed at international level. They include the inviolability of borders by means of violence, the guarantee of security and of autonomy for minorities, not only on paper but in reality. They also include the security of all states in the region, the same security for all under international guarantee. This is the first element: stability and security in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is economic development. The first element will be guaranteed principally by NATO, the second by the European Union. The third element is democracy, the development of civil society and democratic institutions, and here the OSCE and the United Nations will be called upon. In general, therefore, we want to reach a lasting solution after a cease‐fire has been achieved; but this means that we are not fighting against Serbia. We are not fighting against the legitimate interests of the Serbian people. Instead, what we want, on the basis of democracy and on the basis of the legitimate rights of the Serbian people, is for Serbia to return to Europe and then to develop towards our Europe of integration. We consider this to be a long‐term solution and a self‐evident basis for it. In our view Serbia is part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this as someone who, in German domestic politics, particularly in the period 1991‐1992, regretted the collapse of Yugoslavia, in which Mr Milosevic played an essential part and considered himself to be a friend of Serbia. In my view the tragic thing about this – if we look at it from the point of view of Serbia"s history and Serbian interests – is that Milosevic is going to destroy Serbia. He will go down in the history of his people as the destroyer of Serbia, and he is only finding out what others in the past found out who put the term ‘greater" in front of the name of their nation. As soon as nationalism is associated with the term ‘greater", it becomes bloody and aggressive, and at this point it generally leads to the self‐destruction of the nation if it is allowed to proceed. From the point of view of Serbia"s legitimate interests, he will be seen as the destroyer of Serbian interests. He will not create a Greater Serbia but a rump Serbia, if he is allowed to proceed. This is yet another reason why we need to stand up to him.</p>
<p class="contents">The five points formulated by the European Union, NATO and the UN Secretary‐General do not mean all‐out war against Serbia; instead they allow security and stability for everyone in Kosovo while at the same time guaranteeing security and stability in the region and allowing these to blossom. These five points must represent a minimum guarantee. They are not five points that endanger Serbia"s legitimate interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The political process has taken on new momentum following the NATO summit. It is also clear that the notion that NATO – be it only for a limited area, but one that goes beyond Europe – could be an alternative to the United Nations has proved to be a fallacy, as I always believed. On the contrary, it is clear that as a regional security organisation NATO is ideally suited to preventing wars in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO must continue in future to regard this as its primary task, although this must also involve a strengthening of the European pillar, which is something we will have to discuss later. The war in Kosovo makes one thing clear to all of us, and I would like here to come back to François Mitterrand, but I could also quote Helmut Kohl, who said: Europe is about war and peace, it is not just about the economy, market regulations and intervention prices, important though all these may be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ultimately about war and peace. Strengthening Europe"s individual responsibility will be one of the consequences that we all have to face.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">But at the same time it shows how important it is that Europe and its partners understand the need for closer cooperation. Yet this also means that Europe itself must take joint action, and it was difficult enough to enforce the necessary sanctions in the European Union. I would like to emphasise this once again, and I am pleased that we have finally succeeded not only in stepping up EU sanctions against Yugoslavia but in upholding the EU oil embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the political process took on new momentum after Washington as a result of the strength of the Western alliance. Russia has become more involved, which we very much welcome. The UN Secretary‐General was invited to the special summit of Heads of State and Government, and he too has become increasingly involved, which we also welcome emphatically, and I am delighted to be able to give you the latest news that following yesterday"s meeting of the Political Directors of the G8 in Bonn, who were able to agree on a common basis, we will now be holding a G8 ministerial meeting on Kosovo in Bonn on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as an important step towards drafting a Chapter VII resolution in the Security Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the permanent members of the Security Council to take on an active role in drafting such a resolution. Involving Russia means above all that Russia will stop blocking decisions in the Security Council so that we can arrive at a Chapter VII resolution clearly based on international law and a decision of the Security Council as the sole holder of power in the international political system. I think that on this basis there will be considerable movement, particularly in Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues remain open. The crucial point, I must emphasise once again, is still the international peace‐keeping force. Any cease‐fire solution that does not settle this beyond doubt will not in my opinion be capable of bringing about an actual cease‐fire, because the return of refugees must be linked to a robust peace‐keeping force with a strong NATO involvement, but also including Russia, neutral countries and others. Without this security guarantee the refugees and displaced persons will not return, and the result would be that Milosevic had won and that we would live in a Europe that was no longer our Europe, a Europe which this Parliament – the Parliament of a Europe of integration – really represents.</p>
<p class="contents">This, let me stress once again, was really the crucial point which also caused Rambouillet to fail, and it is the crucial point for future negotiations. Once this is settled, of course, everything will then head in the direction of a stability pact, and I have already discussed the rest. What we will need here is therefore a strong UN mandate with a substantial NATO component. This is absolutely vital. I hope that we will be able to achieve a substantial breakthrough in the course of this month. I believe that the G8 meeting on Thursday may represent a crucial step forward.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, the deportation and ethnic cleansing mean that the exodus continues. This crime against humanity requires a determined and unified response. We owe that not only to the victims but also to ourselves if we want to stand for a Europe with full respect for basic values.</p>
<p class="contents">We also regret the unintended civilian casualties of the air strikes, but we feel morally obliged to continue to support the objective of stopping the greater evil, that is, the racist policy of Milosevic and those around him. We are grateful for the multiple diplomatic efforts by the EU, its presidency, the United States and also Russia. We hope Russia will agree with the need for a credible international peacekeeping force in Kosovo within the framework of a political settlement. I fully subscribe to what Minister Fischer said about the essence of agreeing to that, while drawing on the lessons learnt in Bosnia and the Kosovo verification mission.</p>
<p class="contents">If that agreement could be reached with Russia, it would considerably increase the pressure on Milosevic, possibly through a United Nations Security Council resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission remains active in helping to alleviate the consequences of the tragedy by different means. Firstly, of course, by humanitarian assistance for the refugees and the international organisations that take care of them. At the end of this debate Mrs Bonino will make the necessary comments. Furthermore, by assisting the governments of the countries of the region most affected by the massive influx of refugees. Also by planning, together with the World Bank, the acceleration of assistance to the neighbouring countries which are bearing a heavy economic burden because of the crisis. By preparing for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a political and diplomatic situation has been achieved, which would also include participation by the EU in a temporary administration of Kosovo, pending final definition of its status. Last but not least, in trying to prepare for the upgrading of the EU's political and economic relations with all the countries in the western Balkans via stabilisation and association agreements, as an important element and pillar of the stability pact of which the presidency has spoken, aiming at security, democracy and economic development, with, at the same time, the further perspective of joining the European and Euro‐Atlantic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means a comprehensive, massive and costly effort, in addition to the military one borne by our Member States, in order to provide the billions of euros which will be needed to fund all these efforts by the international community. The price for a durable and just peace and stability in the Balkans will be high but, at the same time, is imperative both in terms of finance and human resources. That is why I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, to call on Parliament and the Council to provide the Commission in due course with the instruments and funds needed to meet our share of this tremendous challenge which we will have to face together. We look forward to the discussions in the General Affairs Council, scheduled for the end of this month, to fill in certain elements of these big projects which are aimed at contributing substantially to a more durable and stable western Balkans in the next century.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, Mr Morris certainly deserves an answer to his question. But allow me first of all, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, to express my group"s full support for the line you have taken here today. My group firmly believes that the United Nations must be involved or brought back into the process. I was also very pleased, Mr President‐in‐Office, to hear the remarks you made concerning the fundamental relationship between NATO and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people believe that NATO could become the new world or regional police force, and perhaps see a basis for this in the text of NATO"s Washington declaration. We believe, however, that only the United Nations can play the role of world police and we must do everything we can to reform the United Nations – since reforms are needed – so that it can really play this role well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as already mentioned, the United Nations must play a crucial role in the peace process that now needs to begin. I support you on this point too, Mr President‐in‐Office. It must and can only play this role if it can act effectively. For this reason Milosevic"s ‘offer" to admit an unarmed United Nations force must of course be rejected. We have already had the experience of sending armed troops into Bosnia, where Milosevic or certain Serbian troops managed to make the United Nations look ridiculous because they had to stand by and watch massacres taking place. We need the United Nations forces to be deployed effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, even in this House some people have said that we could maintain or achieve peace in Europe without Russia, perhaps even if Russia were snubbed. This is not possible, nor would it make sense. I therefore agree fully with the view which you expressed, Mr President‐in‐Office, and also the Commissioner. We must bring Russia back on board and we must succeed in persuading Russia to return to a cooperative approach. This is absolutely crucial, not just in the Balkans but in general for the peace process in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the refugees. Winter comes more quickly than we think. If the expulsions continue there will be a massive problem. I do not know whether everyone is well prepared, whether coordination between the individual institutions functions properly. But if we do not want to have another disaster – with the accommodation of refugees next winter – we must do everything you said and we must further improve coordination. I am pleased that Germany has increased its quota. It may be necessary to further increase the quotas for all countries, although the principle must continue to be to help the refugees in the region if possible. However, the burden with which particularly Macedonia (FYROM) and to some extent Albania have to cope should not be disproportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the regional approach. I believe that the regional approach we have been taking is no longer sufficient, and we must find a new one. Development in Croatia is linked to that in Bosnia, Bosnia to Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia to Albania, Albania to Macedonia. They must all – in my opinion at least – be brought together in a type of Balkan federation, but this can only work if the European Union offers strong political and economic incentives. These can only work if Slovenia is also involved, and Slovenia has already requested privileges in its economic relations with these countries. Bulgaria and Greece in particular should also be invited to help to implement this regional approach. I believe in the regional approach, but ours was too weak, with too few positive incentives for these countries to cooperate. This must change, and it must do so in the direction described by the Commissioner. Clear support is required from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, you quoted Mitterrand as saying ‘Nationalism is war!". Our reply must be: ‘Europe is peace!".</p>

We have been discussing Kosovo constantly in this House since 1989. Unlike all the governments, we in this Parliament correctly assessed the explosive nature of the Kosovo conflict from the beginning. Now we are having to use military means to solve the problem. What annoys me about the whole story is that we are only now talking about economic sanctions and possibly implementing them. Surely it is not possible that 15 states could reach agreement on military means before agreeing on sanctions affecting the economy. I find this truly regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is also very difficult for our citizens to understand why, with all our military efforts, we have not been able to stop the expulsions carried out by Milosevic. It is also regrettable that we too, with our bombing, are killing people in this war. Yet we in the European People"s Party take the view that NATO must undertake further military attacks in order to make the aggressor give way. Time will tell whether this will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome all diplomatic measures attempting, alongside the bombing, to bring about a political solution. We welcome the fact that Russia is coming on board. We welcome all UN measures and we call upon the President‐in‐Office, following our experiences in Bosnia and in Kosovo, to take steps to finally update the 1949 UN Charter in line with current circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, thousands of new refugees are being driven into neighbouring countries every day by Milosevic"s henchmen, having been displaced within Kosovo itself, and women are being raped and men executed. Assistance for refugees in the region must be much better coordinated than hitherto so that care is not duplicated for some while people in some areas receive no assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to have well‐organised reception facilities for refugees in the region, but unfortunately it will also be necessary for a while to accommodate refugees outside the region. I believe that this House should appeal for a fair sharing of the burden in the EU states. It is not acceptable that Germany, for example, should once again take in the highest number and is now even preparing to take in more. I welcome this of course, but it sends the wrong signal to your colleagues in the other states who are refusing to take in refugees, under the flimsy pretext that it would be better to provide care for them in their own region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of as much as possible being done in the region, but there are constraints after all, and therefore I appeal to the President‐in‐Office, along with the German Minister for the Interior, to ensure greater justice and more burden sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to point out once again that dividing up Kosovo will not solve this problem. The problem can only be solved if Kosovo is preserved and Macedonia and Albania are not further destabilised by it, as Milosevic wishes to do. We support everything the President‐in‐Office said in this context. You have our full support if you continue to work towards stabilising the region.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cars </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the EU and NATO have agreed on some of the basic requirements for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis. The vast majority of the European Parliament has given its wholehearted support to those conditions. But there is growing uncertainty about whether the objectives can be achieved by continued bombing alone. Those of us who are concerned about this hope that we are wrong. But if we accept that neither further bombing nor economic sanctions will produce results, what will the EU and NATO do then? Will we come to accept – possibly on the basis of Russian mediation – a peace which does not fulfil the stated requirements, does not guarantee Kosovo's borders and territorial integrity, does not make it possible for Kosovar refugees and displaced persons to return in safety to Kosovo, and which enables Milosevic to present himself to the Serbs as a victor?</p>
<p class="contents">What other alternative is there? Well, there is an alternative, namely to force Milosevic out of Kosovo through the deployment of ground troops. The Liberals would like to see the EU and NATO preparing for such an action. A realistic expectation as to the likelihood of such an action taking place might in itself be sufficient. To refuse to even prepare is to give Milosevic hope that there is, or may be, a better alternative for him. Let us deprive him of that hope!</p>
<p class="contents">As regards a long‐term solution for Kosovo, we must have a clear answer to the question: to whom do we owe more? Is it to those who have oppressed, driven out, raped and murdered the Kosovar people, or to those who have suffered all of this? For the Liberal Group, the answer to this question is quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirements which we are entitled to impose on the Kosovars are that they should respect the Serbs who live or would like to live in Kosovo. We also have a right to demand that Kosovo never acts in a way which constitutes a threat to the security and territorial integrity of Macedonia, Montenegro or Bosnia. Our long‐term objective must be – through the rapid development of cooperation with the Balkan countries and an open door to the EU – to achieve in the Balkans what we have achieved in the European Union, namely to safeguard democracy, to build an economy which gives the people prosperity, and to bridge the borders between the countries in a way that diminishes the significance of national identity, so that when it comes to our opportunities in life, it is not so important whether we are German, Portuguese, Greek, Dutch or Swedish. Peace and tranquillity in the Balkans is a precondition for entry into Europe, and for the Balkan people too to have the chance to acquire a European identity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wurtz </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, our previous debate on Kosovo on 14 April clarified the positions of the political groups on this tragedy. There was a broad and comprehensive condemnation of the criminal practices, referred to as ‘ethnic cleansing", for which Mr Milosevic"s government is responsible. We expressed solidarity with the refugees and confirmed their right to return to their country and the need to ensure that this right was respected through the presence of an international force in a truly autonomous Kosovo. Finally, there was also broad agreement on the idea of a conference on the Balkans. However, we were opposed to the use of bombing as the means to resolve this terrible crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Three long weeks have passed since then. The humanitarian tragedy which the military intervention was intended to prevent is at its peak. The operations which were to be short‐lived are increasing day by day. The strikes which were intended to hit only strategic targets are killing more and more innocent civilians, traumatising the ordinary people and destroying the economic and cultural foundations of a whole society.</p>
<p class="contents">The destabilisation of the region which NATO"s plans were intended to prevent is now becoming a reality in Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania, while concern is increasing in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and beyond. Old splits in Europe which we were trying to close are getting wider before our very eyes. Under these conditions, the only military victory possible would risk being a Pyrrhic victory, far removed from the fair and lasting peace we are currently seeking.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must warn the European leaders against two things. Firstly, the end cannot justify the means as the one contradicts the other. Secondly, the intended objectives must remain the same as those set out at the beginning. From this point of view, the serious revelations about the military aspect of Rambouillet are worrying. These require clear explanations which I would ask the President‐in‐Office to provide. We should leave Mr Brzezinski and his kind to think that the stakes in this war infinitely exceed Kosovo and actually affect the credibility of NATO and the American leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we should pay attention to the increasingly numerous, louder and weightier voices in Europe, ranging from Oskar Lafontaine to the 180 members of the Italian Parliament of the Democratic Left‐Christian Democrat majority, whose vision of Europe means that, like us, they are also calling for the bombing to stop. Opportunities are arising now to begin a process to find political solutions. The G8 and the Security Council meeting that Mr Joschka Fischer has just mentioned is perhaps an example of these opportunities. I urgently call on Europe to seize these opportunities and face up to its responsibilities.</p>

It is a war in the skies which has bombed the people on the ground back into the 1930s. On day 40 of the bombing, the idea that a few bombs would bring Milosevic to his knees looks to be a non‐starter. NATO has lost sight of the proportions involved; the means are no longer proportionate to the end, and too many civilian targets are being hit.</p>
<p class="contents">But I think it is nonsense to say that the United States has dragged us into this venture. No member country of the Alliance is being forced to take part: all the NATO partners share the responsibility. NATO may lose this war, which would be a disaster for unity within the EU. At the same time, however, it is precisely this war which has currently revived the ideal of political unity amongst the greater European family.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the bombing is not achieving its aim. To my mind, the EU embargo will not do very much. It is a paper tiger. Milosevic is playing for time. Serbian leaders such as Draskovic and Djindjic are openly looking for the route to the EU. We need to be practical in the immediate future. We should support the Chernomyrdin initiative, spare Montenegro from the bombing to some extent where possible, preserve the demographic balance in Macedonia by taking in Kosovar refugees in the EU, so that the conflict cannot escalate further in the region, and block arms supplies to the KLA, as Italy has done.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the longer term, the Council President has put forward an ambitious scenario for the region this afternoon, centred on democracy, security and stabilisation. The EU will have to play a greater part in this in due course; we have at the very least a moral duty to do that. When the bombing and the shooting stops, people will have to go on living together in the Balkans, and it will take well‐armed ground forces – and I repeat, because my country has some experience of this – it will take well‐armed ground troops to guarantee the peace in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the European elections in June, a particularly difficult task awaits us as parliamentarians. We must prepare our voters for those ground troops to be sent to Kosovo and to remain in the region for a long time. But we must do it.</p>

In one war we have terrible pictures, even if they are mostly only pictures from Serbian television, of destruction, of a war conducted by air and with bombs. But there is a second war in Kosovo, and of this we have no pictures. We have refugees, deportees, turning up in Albania and Macedonia, but we do not see, we do not know what is happening in Kosovo. It is a black hole. The problem that we all have is that we want everything at once, in the longstanding tradition of some of our groups. We want the war in Kosovo to end immediately, and we want the bombing to stop. But there are some things we do not know. We are putting our faith in Russia, which is right. We are putting our faith in Kofi Annan, which is right. We do not know how we can end these two wars together, in other words how to stop the massacres and the deportation in Kosovo so that the bombing of Serbia can stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing is the helplessness that we are trying to overcome diplomatically by means of the policy of peace that the EU and by the German Presidency are trying to pursue, a policy that is good. How can we put up a struggle for these people, how do we gain the time to end these two wars together? We all have good advice. We all know how it should be done, so much so that hardly any Members are present for this debate. We MEPs are always the best at giving good moral advice, but when it comes to seriously looking into a problem we have other things to do. This is a situation that should certainly give us cause for thought. I believe there is no alternative to the military intervention, and I say this because I know how terrible it is. But I also believe that we must seize every opportunity to create diplomatic opportunities to bring the war in Kosovo to an end. Otherwise, we have to say that there can be no solution that not does not involve allowing refugees and deportees from Kosovo to return to their country, with military support if necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">As called for by this House, I think that we have first of all to set about bombarding the Serb people with information and radio and television broadcasts, so that we finally bring home to them the true nature of the Yugoslav regime.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point – and the House finally approved this at its last part‐session – is that Milosevic should be indicted as a war criminal. We must set about explaining to Mrs Arbour – and this is something the Council should be doing – that if Hitler had not been indicted, on the grounds that it was impossible to establish who had responsibility for any given concentration camp, it would not have been possible to demonstrate the chain of command linking Berlin and Auschwitz. That, I think, would have been unacceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, even though a million people have been deported, there are apparently no grounds for indicting Milosevic. That is a complete disgrace. I believe that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament should exert increased pressure on Mrs Arbour, who has said that come June she may be sitting on the Canadian supreme court. That, I think, is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third point concerning the physical integrity of the dictator Milosevic. That is a problem that we must tackle immediately: we cannot wait to see his corpse before we begin discussing what ought to have been done.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to know where Milosevic has been getting his support throughout this whole period; who has been helping him in the United States and Europe; who are the people who have been helping him for ten years, enabling him to prosecute this dreadful and criminal policy first in Bosnia and Croatia and now in Kosovo. We have to draw up charges against Milosevic, and so great pressure must be put on Mrs Arbour to persuade her finally to explain what she intends to do at the first opportunity; there has to be a huge information campaign, and Yugoslavia must be brought into Europe, something that we have been calling for for more than 20 years, Mr Fischer, bearing in mind that in 1981 Marco Pannella called in this House for the then Yugoslavia to be integrated into the European Union. We must now recover lost ground and integrate all of the countries into the European Union immediately, using an ad hoc formula, but immediately.</p>

We must not ignore any serious opportunity to do this in order to achieve lasting and therefore realistic solutions which take account of all the causes of the conflict.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gollnisch </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the offensive currently being conducted against Serbia is quite clearly contrary to international law and is also politically reprehensible. It is flouting with impunity the human rights which those who initiated this attack are constantly talking about and it may degenerate to the detriment of European and perhaps world security.</p>
<p class="contents">This offensive is clearly contrary to international law. To start with, conventional international law states that a war can be engaged only after having been declared. This was not the case here. From now on the United States Government will not show us the archive footage of the Roosevelt speech after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour. You must remember the quotation – ’a date which will live in infamy" – and all because the American Secretary of State, who knew perfectly well what was happening, hung about for a few hours in the anteroom of the Japanese Ambassador who had just informed him of the declaration of war. His sole purpose in doing this, in American and international public opinion, was to profit from the resulting indignation. The American Government is today reserving this indignation for itself. There have been many other infamies and many have been committed on the initiative of the US Government.</p>
<p class="contents">This offensive is also clearly contrary to the United Nations Charter which explicitly states that the use of force, except in the case of legitimate defence, is subject to the authorisation of the Security Council. This requirement was cast aside with incredible cynicism and in defiance of this basic international law. The Security Council"s authorisation was not requested because we knew that it would not have been granted.</p>
<p class="contents">This offensive is also contrary to the NATO Charter, that is, the North Atlantic Treaty. NATO was a purely defensive alliance to begin with and has been converted for this particular conflict into an offensive alliance which is intervening outside its geographical sphere of action, since Yugoslavia has never fallen within the ambit of NATO. These are the violations of the laws involved.</p>
<p class="contents">But political morality is under attack too. By encouraging the secession of the Kosovar Albanians, who have not always been innocent themselves of violent acts, we are consequently justifying just what we are condemning and in particular the actions of Milosevic"s government. If the Albanian claims to Kosovo are founded on the basis of the rights of an ethnic majority, then Milosevic had good grounds in claiming for Serbia the annexation of Croatian Krajina, populated in the main by Serbs, or the annexation of part of Bosnia, also partly populated by Serbs. We have to choose one way or the other. If ethnic rights are to form the basis, then clearly everyone must have their share of the cake and an international conference will be needed to redefine the borders. On the other hand, and this is my opinion, if we insist on respect for the international borders as a fundamental principle of security in international relations, then this principle cannot be just cast aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in terms of human rights, we are right to feel sorry for the fate of the unfortunate refugees but the number of refugees has increased massively since the intervention and the comprehensive bombing, or if their numbers were as high as was claimed before the NATO intervention, how is it that no plans were made to accommodate them? We are clearly being brainwashed. This issue is being dominated by lies and one‐sided propaganda, as we have seen in other cases. The US Government is really imposing its protectorate on Europe. No doubt Mr Clinton is also using this bloody video game to make people forget about the sexual shenanigans in the White House. As a man, a politician and an officer, I am ashamed today to be European.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in view of the last speech it is worth reminding this House that ethnic cleansing has gone on in Kosovo for ten years and that refugees were being driven out of their homes long before the NATO bombing. It seems to me the worst sort of appeasement to say that if the international community has not acted in one case it should not act in any other.</p>
<p class="contents">I would begin by once again congratulating the President‐in‐Office for his firmness over this issue of Kosovo and the clarity with which he has led the European Union during his time in office. I have been a Member of this Chamber for ten years and we seem to have spent most of those ten years debating events in former Yugoslavia. We have had endless resolutions, endless debates, all of which have been trying to hide our helplessness in confronting what was going on in Yugoslavia. What we have to be firm on is that we are not going to spend the next ten years debating the same. It has to stop now. The 10th anniversary of the beginning of it all, with the removal of autonomy from Kosovo, has to be the year in which it finishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Some veterans from the Spanish Civil War were in the public gallery yesterday. That reminded me of the slogan of the Spanish Civil War, the defence of Madrid: <span class="italic"> no pasarán – </span> they shall not pass. And that must be the message that comes from this House in this debate and from the European Union. Whether they are living in London or Pristina, minorities must not have to live in fear of their lives or fear of random violence which seeks to destroy their homes and their livelihoods. We must be absolutely clear on that. We must stand firm against the sort of sick minds who feed on fear and hatred of minorities, whether they are planting nail bombs in London or engaging in mass murder in Kosovo. There should be absolutely no ambiguity about our message. We must not let Milosevic win. That means that we must have a proper enforceable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has always made it clear that we believe that Russia should be fully involved and I fully support its latest peace mission. But we must not mistake a waved piece of paper for a proper peace. We have made that mistake in the past. There must be no more games from Milosevic. There must be an enforceable peace based on an international force which has NATO as its core. There should be no retreat from that position whatsoever. We must in future learn from what has happened in Bosnia where there is still no peace but only an absence of war.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn from the mistakes we have made to ensure that we can get effective international cooperation in putting the whole of the region back together again. The greatest fear has to be long‐term destabilisation, not just in Montenegro, not just in Macedonia, but further abroad, including the effect on Greece and Italy for example. There has to be a long‐term plan but I would remind the Council that the stability pact was something Parliament called for two years ago. I would hope that in light of the Amsterdam Treaty coming into effect, the Council and the Commission start listening a bit more carefully to Parliament. On many of the issues about former Yugoslavia we have led the Council and the Commission. So it is time to start listening to us.</p>

As we know, the operation is a protracted one and has been thoroughly prepared. Those ultimately responsible can no longer be negotiated with. If we are to apply the classic criteria for a just war, then only the removal of Milosevic"s racist dictatorship will do. Only then will the means used be proportionate to the improvement of the situation in the Balkans which is to be achieved. It will have to be in this way, perhaps with a security pact of the kind the minister referred to, that the conditions are created throughout the Balkans for the rule of law and democracy to be established and for all sources of aggression of the kind currently embodied by the Milosevic regime to be eradicated. In the meantime, the states bordering on Yugoslavia – Albania, Macedonia, but also Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia‐Herzegovina and Croatia – must be helped to survive the damage they have suffered through the actions of Serbia. They are expected to uphold the boycott and embargoes. The EU itself has not suffered much as a result of these, but these other poor countries certainly have done.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the financial and macro‐economic aid given by the World Bank and the IMF, but the EU will have to change its own economic and trade policy, because humanitarian aid can never make up for the loss of export opportunities and the blocking of transport links with the Union. The European Union needs to look very quickly at how far it can provide an alternative market for its friends in the Balkans, and act accordingly. In this context, we welcome the proposals to conclude a special kind of association agreement with the two countries most affected, Albania and Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must also offer help in upgrading the communications infrastructure in the countries concerned to create good alternatives to transit through Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like wholeheartedly to endorse the excellent words of Mr Fischer, because I think we have to send a very clear message here in terms of the Council"s attitude.</p>

The outflow of refugees is continuing. In Kosovo, hundreds of thousands of Albanians are being held hostage, abused and raped by Serb soldiers. In the words of the Albanian writer, Ismaïl Kadaré, in today's <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> , the situation is on the point of becoming ‘<span class="italic">Le triomphe du crime</span> ' – a victory for crime. Is it possible to imagine a greater fiasco in terms of a rescue mission, however well‐intentioned it was in the beginning?</p>
<p class="contents">Many people are now beginning to despair, and some are clutching at the idea of using ground troops as a last resort. In this case, I think they should read the interview given in <span class="italic">Die Zeit</span> by General Eisele, the German UN general, in which he says that it is not simply that this could turn into a long drawn‐out war, but that it will drag on for four or five months before the first rescue force is able to intervene in Kosovo. One has to understand that military means have their limitations. Perhaps it is as the Hungarian writer György Konrád wrote the other day in the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine</span> , that Europeans have learned from history, but they have learned the wrong things. They have learned absolutely nothing from the 1989 lesson in non‐violence. Dictators fall sooner or later. The most effective way is not necessarily to start a war against them. Milosevic will also fall – there is no doubt about that. There is a Serbian opposition which is making itself visible today in an article in <span class="italic">Libération</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">We must try non‐violent methods, we must stop the war, and we must not allow it to result in the militarisation of the EU. Instead, let us turn the recommendation on a civil peace corps – as proposed by the Greens and recently approved by Parliament – into a reality. That would be a constructive contribution by the EU to establishing peace in Kosovo.</p>

The Kosovar people were being massacred and we had to intervene. As a civilised society, the European Union could not shirk that obligation or avoid that need. In the circumstances, however, we have to point to the inadequacy of the measures taken and the precarious nature of political intervention by the European Union in the past. That perhaps is the source of this sense of great bitterness. Nonetheless, we must now look to the future and identify the solutions that will bring an end to this war, but it will not end unless an area of security and peace is created in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Tirana from 21 to 23 April, and I realised there the need to make the presence of the European Parliament felt, as we do not so far appear to have arranged for an official presence in the region, although that would have been the right thing to do. I met many political representatives of the government and the opposition: the President of the Parliament, Mr Ginuisynis, the Minister for European Integration, Mr Lakori, who is calling for an association between Albania and the European Union, and the opposition leader, Mr Berisha. All of them, both government and opposition, are calling for NATO to put in ground troops, because they understand – and this may be the realistic view – that Albania will not long be able to withstand the pressure, the presence of 350 000 refugees, equivalent to six million refugees arriving in Italy from one day to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is extremely serious and only armed intervention – unless Milosevic gives way beforehand on the conditions laid down by NATO and the European Union – can in some way relieve the situation and create a safe area, paving the way to the zone of peace and security we have talked about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also take this opportunity to remind the House that normal conditions of democracy have yet to be established in Albania itself. The European Parliament must act immediately to restore the kind of democratic conditions that apply in our countries, because representatives and militants of the opposition party are still in prison and some members of the Albanian Parliament have been deprived of their parliamentary immunity.</p>

I think the breadth but also the substance of what he said gives room for hope in a situation which is nevertheless rather sombre, and I hope that he will continue in what remains of the German Presidency to act in accordance with those principles and those ideas, especially in the crisis over Kosovo. There is still no solution in sight to the Kosovo conflict. Intensive diplomatic activity has not yet produced results. But it is important – as others have already said – and welcome that Russia is playing an important part in the diplomacy, and time remains of the essence. This conflict must not go on for too long, because the damage done increases with every day that passes.</p>
<p class="contents">Milosevic shows no sign of making the one important concession of allowing peacekeeping troops into Kosovo so as to enable the refugees to return. I entirely share Mr Fischer"s view that these people, refugees who have been driven out of their country, will need military protection of this kind, on psychological grounds alone. Until Milosevic genuinely gives way, there is no reason to stop the NATO action, however welcome such a pause might be.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned about stability in the surrounding countries. Public opinion there seems to have little sympathy with the NATO action. We know how things stand in Macedonia, but in Bulgaria too, the tension is mounting. A lively debate is under way there today in the parliament about whether Bulgarian airspace should be made available for the NATO action. People are deeply divided about the NATO bombing in Bulgaria, and the economic effects of the war in Kosovo are becoming increasingly apparent, as Mr Oostlander also mentioned. The cost is already put at some 70 million dollars per month. We know how poor the country is, and what an enormous cost this is. And people do not understand why their poor country should have to meet that cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Council and the Commission to look at whether this country too might be given extra economic aid in the short term. That would do much for stability in Bulgaria, but would also make the Bulgarians better disposed towards the EU and NATO. That good relationship has taken something of a knock. Bulgaria cannot wait for a stability pact, a plan for the Balkans, it needs help now.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is true of Bulgaria is also true of other countries in the Balkans. NATO is and was prepared to fight for human rights by military means, but the European Union must as soon as possible invest money, know‐how and energy in developing the region. Otherwise, we can just sit back and wait for the next conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, 4 May, is a day on which the Netherlands commemorates the victims of World War Two. Tomorrow we celebrate the liberation. The celebrations will be somewhat muted this year. And you know why: because today too, in Kosovo and Serbia, people are having to die for the sake of freedom.</p>

<p class="contents">Reason is not always convenient – indeed, it is inconvenient – but anyone willing to disregard it does so at his peril. Reason would have dictated, for example, that when this whole business started – and perhaps we can say this with hindsight – there would have been an assessment made of the relationship between the political objectives and the political effects of the air strikes and the entirely worthy goal we set ourselves of putting an end to ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the scenario today is an unpalatable one.</p>
<p class="contents">A perceptive journalist wrote this morning in an Italian newspaper that NATO is in a bad way and Milosevic in a worse one. We have arrived at a turning‐point in this situation where there has to be a change of tactics. Something new is needed, because the air strikes are no longer having an effect: either the attacks continue against the same targets that have been attacked up to now, or attacks are launched on the cities. Out‐and‐out war is not an option, it simply does not exist: above all, the United States Congress will not accept it. So what else can we do? Milosevic is in an ugly predicament as well, but he has the backing of his own people's nationalism. Now let us be quite clear about this: in the days of fascism, the Italian people were not all anti‐fascists either. Nationalism did exist, and it was a powerful force. Hence the need to take account of it in the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What needs to be done? We need to see what cards Milosevic has in his hand, and for that to be achievable, the air strikes have to be suspended. The stronger, the more reasonable party must act to suspend the air attacks to let us see what cards each side holds, to get negotiation back on track and to reach a solution to the problem, naturally taking account of the rights of the refugees, guaranteed by a military force, to return to Kosovo.</p>

The human drama has developed into a disaster, the victims of the hypocritical collateral accidents are increasing, the Rambouillet pretext has disappeared and the autonomy of Kosovo and ethnic rights have not been reestablished. This means that none of the arguments put forward by NATO for this offensive have been validated and none of its initial objectives have been achieved. Around the world, and despite its widespread manipulation, public opinion is making itself heard and is calling for UN intervention and a political solution allowing the return of the refugees and respect for the current borders. However, the Americans and the subordinate European governments are talking about ground offensives and responding with the so‐called ‘total war" in which everything is regarded as a strategic target. They are also supporting and rearming a movement which everyone regarded as a terrorist and fundamentalist organisation until recently.</p>
<p class="contents">European integration, the origins of which also lie in war in Europe, as I well remember, is now in a situation where Community institutions are defending and excusing NATO and its armed interventions. Meanwhile, this same NATO is altering its strategic basis in order to turn itself into a world police force, without the governments showing any willingness to explain this to the public and without this House being able to discuss this. Basically, ladies and gentlemen, this is regrettable and sad.</p>

It may well be that ten years from now, Milosevic's view of us will be that we were right but we lacked the might. We have in fact decided to combine might and right, but we took the decision ten years too late. Had we in Europe had this discussion on the integration of the Balkans ten years ago, we might not have had on our conscience the 200 000 dead of the war in Bosnia and Milosevic's war against Croatia and so on. And we have made a mistake, because in the whole of the argument he puts forward – with which I do not for a moment agree – Mr Gollnisch makes just one point that is true. We should have catered for the dreadful tragedy of the exodus and deportation, but at the moment we are floundering in the dark, with no coordination, with a great deal of goodwill, certainly, but with no scientific approach to humanitarian intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">We were slow to react and we failed to react in the right way, and the issue facing us today – and Mr Dupuis said as much – is that we must realise that the time has come to mount a huge information campaign directed at the Serb population, so that they too understand that right and might are on our side and not on the side of Milosevic. The Serb people have to believe that too, otherwise our initiative will fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Right and might are on our side then, and I therefore say to you, Mr Fischer, that we can and must be far‐sighted in our strategy and more flexible in our tactics. If I may make a point which is intended in a friendly and not an antagonistic way, we Europeans are a little more skilful than the Americans in that we take a more far‐sighted strategic approach and a more flexible tactical approach. So we ought to be able to turn this vision of ours to good account, and then what you said earlier – that ‘May could be a month of hope" – could also provide a more reassuring message for our future and, above all, for the future of peace and justice in the Balkans.</p>

I should like to look in greater detail at two points which unfortunately were not given much attention in the discussion but are in my view essential. We are constantly talking about having to send ground troops into Kosovo. This is a reasonable idea in itself, but it is not appropriate for this region. We already know from experience – and I am perhaps old enough to have been involved in these experiences – that foreign troops simply do not succeed. On the other hand, I have witnessed the liberation of Krajina in Croatia, for example. There the Croats had weapons and were able to sweep the Serbs aside immediately. It has been proved again and again that people who are defending their own land are superior to the aggressors. We must recognise this. There is the KLA, there are the Albanian forces, and we must give them weapons so that they can meet the mobs coming out of Serbia on an equal footing. We will be astonished at how quickly the ground fighting will come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that at the beginning we made a huge psychological error by repeatedly saying that the Kosovars must remain with Serbia, must remain in Yugoslavia. Ladies and gentlemen, we keep forgetting the fact that the state is there for the people, the people are not there for the state. So the people should have the right to self‐determination, and we should grant this right to the inhabitants of Kosovo, who for decades have undergone indescribable suffering at the hands of the Serbian Government in Belgrade. Milosevic is only the product of an old policy that goes back to before the Second World War.</p>

Nor has it made Mr Milosevic relent. But it has succeeded in causing great concern by endangering the whole of the region, and in humiliating the UN and, of course, the political unity of Europe. It is clear that this was one of the intentions of American nationalism, while our leaders in Europe connive out of regional fears or aspirations, brushing aside the opportunity to proceed collectively and autonomously.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these offensives will destroy Serbia and will severely harm the Serbian people, killing and wounding many of them. Could the presidency give us an account of the victims? It appears that the Kosovar Albanians, together with the Serbs and those living in neighbouring countries, will be the first victims of the pollution caused by the depleted uranium contained in the war‐heads that are being used in the region. Could the presidency comment on the use of this substance, on the pollution that is envisaged as a result, and on how long this pollution will last? How can the presidency guarantee the return of the refugees to a land that is so polluted? Or perhaps it has already tacitly ruled out the return of the refugees?</p>

It is time to ask ourselves whether it was a good way to attain our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethnic cleansing and injustice can never be tolerated. It is time to put an end to Milosevic's reign of terror, but it is also time to put an end to the NATO bombing. It is time to put forward a political solution to what is a political problem. As a former prime minister of Sweden, Olof Palme, once said: ‘One cannot establish democracy by bombing the villages one should be preserving'. The EU has political, diplomatic and economic means at its disposal, and it should make use of them in the Balkans. It is time for the EU to make an active contribution to establishing the right conditions for a political solution to the war in Kosovo. It is time for the UN to resume its rightful role and for the EU to call for a UN peacekeeping force in Kosovo, so that the refugees can return in safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU countries should draw up a large‐scale Marshall plan for the Balkan region, to rebuild the devastated communities and to counteract the hatred, which will otherwise provide a breeding‐ground for future conflicts for generations to come. The war has taught us that the EU needs to develop without delay an instrument for conflict resolution, peacekeeping, mediation, reconciliation and confidence building. If we cannot find methods for resolving conflicts peacefully, without being forced to use military means, then the whole idea behind the EU will crumble away.</p>

Who among us is not following these events with growing concern? Have we not for years defended human rights in every sitting here in the European Parliament? I will do the same here today for the last time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been fairly vocal in defending human rights, sometimes for small groups of people. Here we are concerned with hundreds of thousands of people whose rights are being repeatedly violated – I do not need to give all the details again here – and this is happening in a part of Europe that was formerly very popular among tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view there are two very different aspects to the NATO response. For the first time a regional alliance of nations is emerging to defend these people"s human rights, to restore stability to a part of Europe that has for eight years seen one set of violations lead to another, and always for the same reasons. The UN, however, failed completely as it was not able to apply either its Charter or international law in practice; instead, a lot of what it said remained merely empty words, and it did not manage to prevent the conflicts for which it was actually created.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who lived through the Second World War, as I did, knows what it is like to experience bombs and see burning houses and victims of war at close quarters. We would not wish it on anyone, and certainly not on the Serbian people and Serbian children whose leader"s madness has driven them to ruin in the same way as it has hundreds of thousands of others. No one has anything against the Serbian people. Each one of us would protect Serbian children in the same way as we would Kosovar or Albanian children. We must at long last speak out to condemn this madness.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that we cannot only summon the UN when we need it. Parliament will make every effort to ensure that this region is rebuilt when the time comes, and I also see this commitment in Emma Bonino, in Mr van den Broek and in others with whom we have worked for a long time. Every opportunity for negotiation must be used, but only when the madness has been ended and we really can provide these people with a home, protection and peace.</p>

<p class="contents">Faced with the monstrous nature of the crime committed by Milosevic, which is already ethnocide and may also be genocide, I agree with those who firmly believe that we had to do something. I support the majority in this Parliament which has warmly approved the military intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I do not believe for one moment that Mr Milosevic"s brutal nature could allow him to be receptive to a measure such as a unilateral halt to our action in order to restart political talks. I feel it is dangerous even to consider this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the result of our action is worrying. Serbia is certainly being weakened, but not really Milosevic. The ethnic cleansing in Kosovo is getting worse. Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro have become weaker and the prospects are not good. Now that this war has been started, we must win it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to talk about the future. Many opinions have been expressed here today, some of which I agree with, but not all. What interests me is ‘how". Minister, Mr President‐in‐Office, how was this offensive prepared? Was the European Union, or at least the Member States involved, consulted about the plan of attack? Did the EU comment on the chances of success of this plan and on the existence or otherwise of any other plan? Did the Council you are presiding over discuss the option of supplementing the air strikes with a ground offensive, which anyone can see is essential strategically? Did the Council of Ministers at that point seek to develop the means to establish a common strategic debate so that the elements of this action specific to Europe could be proposed to the Alliance Council? And finally Mr Fischer, at this point in time, can you tell us if the Council is aware of the urgent need to develop within the Alliance a capacity for analysis and defence specific to Europe?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gröner </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, for too long the international community has allowed Milosevic to do as he pleases, without trying all possible sanctions such as an oil embargo. Even in the early 1990s we heard reports of the use of mass rape as a weapon of war in Croatia and in the war in Bosnia. Today we are once again hearing from international aid organisations that women are being deliberately picked out of groups of refugees and dragged off by force, to be returned next morning half dead and highly traumatised or never to be seen again.</p>
<p class="contents">This violence against women, this wave of torture and rape motivated by nationalism, intensifies the spiral of violence, hatred and revenge that is destroying all hope of a peaceful multi‐ethnic Kosovo. Women are falling victim to war criminals because they are women, and the EU must recognise this as grounds for asylum. In my view, however, it is the height of cynicism that in this situation the Vatican allows women to use contraception but labels abortion as murder.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our Heads of State and Government and, Mr Fischer, your colleagues should blush with shame when we see where refugees have been taken in and where they have not. Four EU Member States have not taken in any refugees. The Union must increase humanitarian aid and immediately review the NATO strategy. We must stop the bombing and we must, with Russian involvement, return to the negotiating table with a negotiating position.</p>

Mrs Gröner spoke of this earlier. But calling it a policy is going a little too far. Of the more than 600 000 Kosovars who have fled and been driven out of house and home, fewer than 18 000 have so far been taken in by the Member States of the Union. Of these, Germany has taken nearly 10 000, which means that the rest of the Member States between them have not yet managed even 8 000 Kosovars. Just imagine, in the space of a few weeks in the poorest areas in Europe, 600 000 people have had to be housed in camps, and even private homes as well. That figure of 600 000 is twice the number of people that we in our wealthy countries consider each year for asylum, because asylum seekers number only 300 000 or so a year.</p>
<p class="contents">We all share the responsibility for this flood of refugees. In the course of the last few weeks, out of solidarity and humanity, we should have devised a policy for absorbing these refugees and dividing them up fairly between the Member States. I see it as proof of the Council"s impotence that it was unable to take a decision of that kind, and to some extent I see this as a refusal to put your money where your mouth is. At any rate, this House must galvanise the Council into action. The problem of refugees and human misery cannot be solved by throwing ECU 250 million at it. What we want to see is a temporary haven for substantial numbers of them in our Member States, together with every possible material assistance to the countries in the region, not least after the crisis is over.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, this is I think the second or third time we have discussed this issue. Let me begin with you, Mr Rocard. I do not know what level of information the Member States of the Union or those who sit on the North Atlantic Council have. What I can say is that, at a humanitarian level at least, the Commission, like all the humanitarian agencies, was not given information by those Member States which belong to both the European Union and the North Atlantic Council. No one was briefed or informed of any plans or given any information. I actually believe that, from the humanitarian point of view, the problem is one of coordination. Ladies and gentlemen, it is right and proper that individuals, including the individual Member States, should be generous, but this does make coordination more or less impossible. It is very difficult, even for the UNHCR, successfully to organise hundreds of NGOs, funded by private donations, as well as the structures of the 15 Member States that have quite rightly been spurred into action, besides the other donors from the United States, together with the Canadians, the Norwegians, the Japanese and so on. It is, I can assure you, easy to talk about the role of coordination, but more difficult to carry it out, and one reason for this is that, understandably, everyone feels the need for a visible political presence, and we can all agree on that. In the final analysis, there is clearly some divergence of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">How then are we to avoid duplicating aid when practically no one knows what the Member States are doing? How can we avoid the kind of mistakes that arise when generosity is not matched by experience? It is, for example, difficult to inform, warn or prevent someone from setting up camps where they are not able to be maintained because, in the rush, nobody consults. What I am trying to convey to you here is that there has not to this day been any limitation on funding or on humanitarian projects. There has been a serious lack of coordination, of discipline, and a failure to set priorities. And so it seems to me that the task of the UNHCR – our task therefore – is not of the easiest.</p>
<p class="contents">A second question that has been put to me, and this is something on which we are working, is the more important issue of providing shelter. It is true that what we mostly see are the camps with their dreadful conditions, but honourable Members should realise that the great majority of the deportees have been taken in by extremely poor Albanian or Macedonian families, as we all know, and that one of the major efforts we are making is to provide aid to those families, specifically to prevent social tensions and to ensure that the refugees do not find themselves on the street after enjoying a month's generous hospitality, thereby creating social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Another activity in which we are very much involved is, more particularly, preparing for the worst‐case scenario, namely the advent of winter. For some of the refugees at least, we are restoring brick‐built housing and community centres to enable us to evacuate as soon as possible the vast majority of deportees who are living under canvas and to provide them with more acceptable health and sanitary conditions, or at least better climatic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also draw your attention to three other risk factors that have to be borne in mind: the first is Macedonia, because of the political problem there. However, although I appreciate the political problem which the Macedonian Government has, I do not think its attitude to the deportees at the frontier is acceptable – and nor would it be acceptable in any circumstances. While I understand its difficulties, it is not acceptable that anyone should violate the humanitarian conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that of Montenegro. The House should not forget that there are in Montenegro 70 000 deportees who are human time bombs. These are not the kind of refugees we are used to, they are actually deportees, human time bombs to be used if, when and where Milosevic so decides. And if he decides to dispatch a human time bomb made up of a hundred thousand people against Montenegro, we will really see a problem of political destabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that we should keep in mind concerns Bosnia, which was already in a difficult situation and has taken in 50 000 refugees, in this case Serbs.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue on which we are working relates to the Serb evacuees on Serbian territory, for whom we have made provision by taking specific measures. I shall be returning to the region in the next few days, but I would ask for your help in conveying this message: the crucial element now in humanitarian aid is to set priorities and to be disciplined and coordinated; failing that, I am afraid that, despite the great generosity coming from all sides, the result will be total disarray.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two further, perhaps rather more political points that I would make. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that when our forebears opted for the European Community, they did so for two reasons: that there should never again be war between us, and that there should never be another Auschwitz. Today we have to choose between those two eventualities, because it has not been possible to rule out both. We hear the call for a political solution. But what have we been doing with Milosevic over the past ten years if not seeking a political solution? In my humble opinion, we have gone too far: from one conference to the next, from one diplomatic meeting to the next, from one meeting in Geneva to the next. But I would venture to say better late than never. It probably is late – too late, I agree – but just think of the case‐file from Osiek to Vukovar, Srebrenica to Sarajevo, Bihac to Tuzla and so many other shameful crimes, to which we failed to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply cannot say that since we do not intervene everywhere, we should not intervene in our own backyard either. I think it is quite clear where the responsibilities lie here, at least as regards the European Union, for resolving not so much problems far afield as those in our own backyard. If we do not even have the courage for that, if we believe that Europe means having a single currency, a bit of agriculture and – why not? – a spot of fishing, but do not share these principles, and by that I mean the rejection of ethnic cleansing in Europe at least, then it becomes meaningless to call ourselves Europeans.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up where Commissioner Bonino left off. If we look at the debate – and in this respect it resembles all the other debates we have heard in recent weeks – we can see that there are a lot of good individual arguments that we have all thought of from time to time. But if we try to find an alternative way of looking at things we find that we have not heard an alternative. a political solution has been called for. Yes, but a political solution is not an end in itself. The question should be: what must a political solution achieve? a political solution must achieve an end to violence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">a political solution must bring about the return of those who have been displaced and it must in particular ensure that we do not have another ten years of nationalist madness in the Balkans with hundreds of thousands of more deaths.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">a political solution is not an end in itself, so we must talk about the substance of our policy. The only thing I can add there is to offer Mr Milosevic a peace corps. He would like that. He would immediately support that, particularly now. And why? Because then he would have what he wanted. Mr Milosevic is not the man to be influenced by a peace corps. I am very strongly in favour of a peace corps, I am very much in favour of a Europe in which violence has no place. But how are we to respond to someone who has used the most merciless violence not just once, not twice, not three times, but for ten years?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">In my view this is not just a moral issue. It is a question of European security and of the future of Europe. I would accept the criticism if we had acted rashly in resorting to force, but there are at least 200 000 people lying in mass graves because we acted too late. Think of Bosnia! Are our memories so short? Mr Karadzic was in Geneva and signed treaties that just an hour later were no longer valid in Bosnia. This did not happen once, or ten times, it happened umpteen times. What must it take? This is a question we must ask ourselves. Of course we all ask ourselves this question constantly – I can at least say this for the German Government, but surely all the governments involved feel the same – when it is our responsibility. But some statements I have heard have confused cause and effect.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We must not confuse cause and effect here! The cause is Milosevic"s policy. He is not a nationalist but a cynic. His aim is to obtain power. This is why he is using the aggressive tactics of Serb nationalism. He has unleashed the tiger and is trying to ride it, and if we allow him to continue he will not only bring disaster to an entire region of Europe, but he will also cost more innocent lives. The brutal expulsion and exodus we are now witnessing are on a scale that we would not have thought possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Emma Bonino rightly said that these are human bombs, in other words the expulsion is being used doubly cynically as brutal tactics against neighbouring countries. Europe cannot accept this. a political solution that involved accepting this would be completely wrong. It would be the opposite of what we want.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to implement a political solution that uses force on the basis of respect for human rights, common security and the return of all refugees, on the basis of the international community. This is the type of political solution we are trying to achieve. But this presupposes firstly that Belgrade is left in no doubt about the resolve of the international community, and secondly that it understands that a military solution holds no prospects for Serbia and also none for Milosevic personally.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it imperative that we achieve a political solution and a cease‐fire on this basis. I consider it to be not only necessary but crucial that we develop proposals that can be discussed or considered and that have a clear content that can be implemented. On the other hand, it must be clear that cause and effect cannot be confused, and I would like to emphasise this. Milosevic is responsible for this war, which I hope will be the last round of violence. If we do not put a halt to his actions Montenegro will follow, then Sandjak will follow, then Vojvodina and then sooner or later we will have the same war again in a new round, this time in Macedonia. I have no doubts on this score. Therefore, of all the good arguments I have heard, the only possible alternative is a political solution that renounces the use of force, respects human rights and ensures the return of refugees. Belgrade must take this on board. Milosevic must take this step.</p>
