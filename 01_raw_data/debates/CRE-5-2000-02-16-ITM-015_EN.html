<p class="contents">Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure. That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it. In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations – which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta – it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon. We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision. Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself. From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also – I am sure – for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure. But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure. Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice. The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that – whatever happens – the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission’s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament’s legislative powers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be. In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens. On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed. For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors. A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases. It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny. With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced – as the European Parliament had long wanted – to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement. Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament. A key problem is the time factor. When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish. In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days. Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react. Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.</p>
<p class="contents">I just have one more request. In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later. In my view, instead of “<span class="italic">weitergeführt werden müssen</span>” the wording should be “<span class="italic">erhalten bleiben müssen</span>”. The German version is not very clear here. I would ask for that to be checked again. For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur. It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions. When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call “<span class="italic">les pures et dures</span>”: no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions. Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament’s original position on the issue of comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember what is at stake here. Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the whole system is obscure. It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees. Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed. We are to know who is on each committee. We are to know when they meet. We are to get the agendas. We are to get the documents that are sent to them. The whole system will be more open and transparent – if still rather complex. So that is at least a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission. We adopt legislation in the European Union. We expect the Commission to implement it. And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult – especially what was called the “contre-filet” system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. Here too there is at least some progress. The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council. That is a more reasonable system. That, too, is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament. The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal. We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure. Parliament has no equivalent power.</p>
<p class="contents">True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system. We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee. We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question. But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation. In other words, we can challenge the measure for being <span class="italic">ultra-vires</span> but not on its content. And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content. Not that we do so every week. We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary. That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure. That is not correct. Both branches adopt the legislation – Council and Parliament – that confers implementing powers on the Commission. If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall we have a system which has made some progress. The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council. Even here, we have renounced voluntarily – because this did not happen automatically – the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise. We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that. We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision. We must be very vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is a step forward. My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward. We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni. We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years’ time. If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is never easy working on comitology. Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about. Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process. From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament. Mr Corbett set out Parliament’s concerns. He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not. I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied. Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.</p>
<p class="contents">So how far have we come? There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system. This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in. One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a good agreement. It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process. From here on things are going to be easier. But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement. Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent. We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.</p>
<p class="contents">We think there are other positive advances too. To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission’s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it – especially Mrs Frassoni. We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
