The regime in power in the country is regarded throughout Europe as a hard-line dictatorship. After the handover of power to the current rulers, farmers were quickly driven out of the old farms, and the country is constantly teetering on the brink of famine. The Mugabe Government therefore invited the white descendents of the colonialists back onto the land and returned the farms to them, and the situation improved rapidly. Today people are once again gradually being driven out, and even killed, although the government has not even begun training farm workers how to farm in a rational way. Similarly, there is no support for cooperatives or for buying adequate equipment. These are the main problems facing the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution addresses the political problems and contains a number of unsatisfactory and somewhat debatable proposals. I strongly object to the ridiculous challenge issued to South Africa to boycott Zimbabwe at the FIFA World Cup. Perhaps this is not intended to be taken seriously? I also fail to understand why, in supporting point D, the authors say that the main political opposition unfortunately split in October 2005 into two factions. If this observation lays the blame for something at Mugabe’s door, I do not understand the substance of the accusation. If we really wish to make fools of ourselves, we can call on the local shamans to dry up the rivers and make the Victoria falls disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one further remark, about point 5. In some EU Member States, the turnout for elections has also been extremely low. Do we not acknowledge the legitimacy of the elected representatives, Members of Parliament, senators and some of our fellow MEPs? I must say that I am genuinely shocked by this point in the resolution. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will abstain from voting on the adoption of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude with a question for the Commissioner. Commissioner, how do we support the South African Government, which we are calling on to improve the treatment of refugees from Zimbabwe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They suffer on a daily basis from intense political oppression, a collapsed economy and shortages of vital food, water and medical supplies. The United Nations World Food Programme expects to dispense aid to almost four million malnourished people this year – over one third of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">HIV/Aids has had a devastating effect on the country, with one in five adults being HIV positive and over one million children orphaned through the loss of their parents from Aids. Unemployment afflicts 70% of the population. Zimbabwe’s political and economic fortunes are at their lowest point in its 26-year history as an independent nation. Action taken by the international community has been at best lukewarm and lacked the commitment necessary to have a real impact on the situation in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa should be at the forefront of international efforts to pressure the Mugabe regime into making democratic concessions, but I am afraid quiet diplomacy by President Mbeke has achieved nothing tangible. Through its provision of electricity, maize and credit, South Africa could exert enormous leverage on the Mugabe regime. It has not done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we see a resurgence of Chinese interest in many parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe. The Chinese Government seems to have no inhibitions about bolstering tyrannical regimes and supplying them with weapons of oppression in exchange for access to natural resources. I see little evidence of diplomatic effort by the EU or by the governments of Member States to close down those international sources of support that keep Mugabe in power. The EU has been less than robust in strictly implementing its own sanctions regime. No wonder Mugabe takes none of this seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">If the international community is serious about tackling the appalling conditions in Zimbabwe, then the United Nations Security Council should urgently investigate the situation in that country. Unless we give greater priority to Zimbabwe, the Mugabe regime will stagger on until the point where Zimbabwe fails completely, unable to revive itself without immense international assistance. Action now by the international community could help avert this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When one considers all the problems of a country that was once known as the ‘breadbasket of Africa’, one cannot do other than speak of the many courageous people who, in an atmosphere of heavy-handed oppression, are bold enough to keep on denouncing the abuses that go on.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting resolutions, our aim should be to stiffen the sinews of these very people who are fighting for freedom, democracy and development. The impression I get from some parts of today’s resolution is that it will not do that, and I see it as simply wrong-headed to make reference, in a resolution on a matter of urgent importance, to a World Cup that is to be held in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">With effect from 13 September – which really does make this a matter of urgency – widespread, indeed nationwide, demonstrations are to be held, organised by the trade unions and other organisations, to draw attention to the mounting misery of the people and demand minimum wages above poverty level and social responsibility on the part of the government. President Mugabe has already made it known that every one of these demonstrations will be suppressed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we should ensure that these peaceful protests, which highlight the dreadful conditions under which the country’s people live, should be allowed to take place without harassment on the part of the police, and I would point out to the Commissioner that we should give some thought to how we, bearing in mind the structures existing in the region, might manage to send observers to guarantee the right to freely express opinions and to demonstrate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the previous speaker just said, there was a time when Southern Rhodesia or today’s Zimbabwe was the bread-basket of a large part of Africa. Today it is not even in a position to feed its own people.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen these negative sides of decolonisation in many countries, particularly African countries, where the transfer of power into the hands of irresponsible and evil political forces has resulted in the most unfortunate consequences for states that were supposed to rejoice in their freedom from colonial power. Instead, their own inhabitants have been condemned to perdition. The present proposal by the Zimbabwean leader to return farms to their former owners clearly comes too late, and fails to inspire the slightest confidence.</p>

To this we must add the deterioration in living conditions and the growing poverty. I would like to focus in particular, however, on a specific aspect which is also being raised and which furthermore is a topical issue that we often discuss during these urgent debates: freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Just yesterday we were talking about China and lamenting the current high degree of governmental control of the media, in particular the Internet. It appears that Zimbabwe has taken its inspiration from the Chinese formula in drawing up its own law on the blocking of communications, and that is happening within the context of a legislative system that is already highly restrictive in terms of freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">China is a great inspiration in this regard, since, as Human Rights Watch stated in a recent report, the Chinese system of control, known as the ‘Great Firewall’, is the most advanced system of this kind in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Zimbabwean law, the army, the intelligence services, the police and even the office of the President will be able to control and intercept electronic mail, listen to telephone conversations and censor the Internet, all without the need for a legal mandate. This would affect the relationship between doctors and their patients, for example, between lawyers and their clients and between journalists and their sources, and it would undoubtedly pose a huge risk to privacy, to NGOs and to people working to promote human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I believe that it is our duty to call for the withdrawal of that law. I would like, however, to make it very clear that my concern in this regard does not relate solely to Zimbabwe, nor exclusively to China. We must see this concern as a universal one and we must be alert, both with regard to the countries I have mentioned and, for example, with regard to the United States and the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for freedom of expression and the right to privacy must be fundamental elements of any modern society. Today we are talking about Zimbabwe but, I would emphasise, this is an issue that we must not consider solely in relation to that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inefficient and corrupt governing regime led by Robert Mugabe continues to oppress the people, and harassment of political opponents, trade union activists, farmers, human rights organisations, journalists and the judiciary is still widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Government of Zimbabwe to start demonstrating the necessary respect of international conventions and human rights and to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that an important step towards saving the country from an even worse future is for Mr Mugabe finally to relinquish power as soon as possible. Such an action, facilitated by the opening of positive transitional negotiations between Zanu-PF, MDC parties and other opposition movements will, we feel, bring about the much-needed revival of the society, politics and economy of Zimbabwe and bring peace and prosperity to its people in their traumatic transition from British colonisation to independence and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Appeals to Mugabe have proved no more effective than calling on his country’s neighbours – South Africa in particular – to commit themselves more to doing something about it, and the action we in the EU have taken has not made much of an impact on those it was meant to affect.</p>
<p class="contents">How do things stand? According to estimates, some two million people have fled to neighbouring countries, and most are living in them illegally. The so-called ‘Operation Restore Order’ alone had the effect of – in the truest sense of the word – uprooting 700 000 people; four million people do not have enough to eat; unemployment stands at 70%, and the inflation rate is the highest in the world. One effect of the forced resettlements is that the fight against AIDS is being made more difficult, with 3 200 people a week dying of it. There is now as much legislation on the control and oppression of the people as there was before independence.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? We can see to it that the international agencies operating on the ground on behalf of the UN give aid directly to the people wherever possible; we can ensure that the Red Cross can continue its work with the minimum of interference.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want – and I say this to the Commission in particular – is for us also to give aid under the Budget heading of the European initiative for democracy and human rights to Zimbabwean civil society, to the many courageous people there, be it in the trade unions, in the human rights organisations, in the churches or in the independent media. Let us ask the Chinese with whom in Zimbabwe they want to have long-term dealings – with the government or with the people? – and let us take every opportunity to tell our South African partners in dialogue that they, through their failure to act, are neither making things easier for themselves nor doing the people of Zimbabwe any kind of service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Based on the situation that we see today, since the Zimbabwe Government has taken no suitable measures – no measures at all – to seriously address the democratic crisis, the protection of rights and the tragic economic crisis, any possible easing or lifting of the measures adopted by the EU in relation to Zimbabwe is out of the question. In other words, we will not discuss it at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not changing its attitude towards Zimbabwe, and its firm stance has recently been reasserted by my colleague Louis Michel in his contacts with the government authorities in Zimbabwe. He emphasised that the Commission remains absolutely committed to playing an active role in trying to break the stalemate. At the same time, we cannot waive any of the conditions that we have imposed, especially the resumption of democratic rules for the citizens’ daily lives. What was said confirms our concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully and with great interest to the idea of excluding Zimbabwe from the football World Cup in 2010. You all know that a similar decision is being adopted by FIFA but, having said that, I personally think it is an idea worth taking seriously and discussing with the Member States and the International Federation. I cannot say today whether the outcome will be what certain Members here are hoping, but I can say that I shall inform my fellow Commissioners Louis Michel and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner of this idea: the matter deserves to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly another aspect: as I said earlier, Europe hopes that Zimbabwe will return to a path of restoring the conditions for democratic life and economic progress. We are of course ready to point out certain routes to follow, in the context of the priorities of the 10th European Development Fund programme, for instance, within which there are specific possibilities, but we must not fail at this point to impose a very clear condition on Zimbabwe: unless it seriously embarks on the road to democracy, we cannot alter our firm stance.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission is maintaining a very close dialogue with Zimbabwe’s neighbours, particularly the members of the Southern African Development Community and the South African Government. I agree with what I have heard: we shall be increasingly active in calling on these neighbouring countries to do even more.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the United Nations initiatives and, in my view, it is very important for respected African Heads of State or Government to put pressure on the Zimbabwe Government to improve the political and humanitarian situation at last and to pave the way for national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we are worried about the people. Obviously, while our attitude towards the Zimbabwe Government is one of absolute firmness, we need to worry about providing direct assistance to the people, who are not to blame for a regime that deprives them of their freedom and also of their livelihoods. I can confirm that Louis Michel intends to continue supporting and also funding projects concerning socio-economic sectors, medical assistance and the role of organisations on the ground. I would point out that the role of the Red Cross must certainly be facilitated and encouraged, as must projects promoting governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law. In our opinion, direct assistance to the people of Zimbabwe needs to continue in all these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
