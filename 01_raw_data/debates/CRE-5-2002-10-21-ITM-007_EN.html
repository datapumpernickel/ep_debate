I believe that this directive constitutes the core of the common European asylum system, the need for which was underlined in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the conclusions of the Tampere, Laeken and Seville Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the European Parliament that the harmonisation at European level of policies in the field of refugees is absolutely crucial. This is not, in fact, merely an issue of harmonisation: it is a matter of responding to problems facing the Member States in the field of asylum that can only be addressed appropriately at EU level. This applies perhaps particularly to the criteria for receiving international protection. The various national systems currently contain different criteria for citizens being able to receive protection and an at times highly disparate set of laws on refugee status or on subsidiary protection. These differences between the various national systems cause secondary movements, which is undesirable as far as all EU Member States are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to create a situation of equal treatment, the proposal for a directive on qualification for international protection contains standards for a common definition both of refugees and of those who are entitled to subsidiary protection. It also contains standards for rights to be granted to these two categories of people. It guarantees a minimum level of protection in all Member States for anyone in genuine need of international protection, and at the same time prevents abuses in requests for asylum, which damage the credibility of the system. The proposal starts from the premise that international protection must only be granted by Member States if there is no effective national protection in place against persecution, regardless of the source of this persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must emphasise that the subsidiary protection proposed in the directive must be considered to complement the system of protection enshrined in the Geneva Convention on refugees and must be implemented in such a way so as not to damage but to complement the current refugee protection system. The Danish Presidency’s idea, supported by the Commission, is that rapid political agreement should be reached on this proposal, together with the regulation determining the Member State responsible for studying asylum requests, known as Dublin II, and the amended proposal for a directive on asylum procedures, specifically at the end of November at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It is therefore extremely important for the Commission that Parliament adopts its position on the directive as rapidly as possible so that the Council can debate this issue in light of your opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as we have just heard the proposed directive is effectively the linchpin of the common asylum policy, setting out the basis for minimum standards for people qualifying as refugees under the Geneva Convention and subsequent protocols, and also the criteria for people entitled to international protection under other international conventions and human rights legislation. I personally regret the decision to apply this directive only to third-country nationals and stateless persons, thus removing the EU Member States from its scope, and I shall be voting for the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the basis of the Commission's perspective is the need for protection and our responsibility to provide it. The majority of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs supported the Commission in upholding the 1951 Geneva Convention, which does not differentiate between different actors of persecution, and welcomed the move away from the narrow view held by some governments and parties that only state persecution creates official refugees. Full application of the Convention would take account of, for example, those suffering at the hands of the FARC, a non-state agent of persecution in Colombia, and would also cover political opposition in Zimbabwe and countless other instances.</p>
<p class="contents">We disagreed with the Commission, however, on the point of protection being afforded by a state-like agency, such as the UNHCR, and felt that this effectively imposed the duties of a state on a body that could not be held legally accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the committee chose to support amendments by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which strengthen the position of women as a social group liable to persecution in some countries, and have included the example of genital mutilation in line with a previous Parliament decision on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We also took the view that sex and sexual orientation should be taken into account when looking at the definition of a social group. This has been emphasised by the Union under the Copenhagen criteria and the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are well aware of recent cases of persecution in, for example, Egypt and Jamaica.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the committee does not support the view that this directive should deal only with refugee status and that subsidiary protection could be dealt with at a later stage. We agreed with the Commission and the UNHCR that it was appropriate to deal with the two categories together and not just for administrative reasons. The complementary systems consider first of all whether a person needs protection. If they do, then their status needs to be defined. Even a full application of the Geneva Convention does not meet all protection needs and that is why many Member States have additional categories.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true to say, as some do, that those in the additional category necessarily stay for shorter periods or face less serious problems in their country of origin. If we are to have a common asylum policy, we have also to deal with these additional needs and it makes sense to deal with them together. We need a holistic approach that meets our international obligations and the needs of those we aim to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we see the two groups as complementary, the committee majority chose to accord similar social rights to the two groups. It must be sensible to allow those who wish to work, train or acquire an education to do so. It benefits the individuals, our society and their country of origin on return and, by meeting basic social needs, we can avoid larger social costs. The EU's own social inclusion strategy recognises the links, for example, between poor housing, poor health and poor educational attainment. If this applies to our own nationals, it seems only reasonable for those entitled to international protection to benefit from an equivalent entitlement if we are to avoid creating social exclusion, contrary to our own EU policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee also agreed by a majority to a definition of family that aims to maintain the principle of family unity and to embrace a wide definition of family. That is a familiar argument in this House. It seemed sensible to accord similar status to all family members, if only to avoid the bizarre situations which sometimes occur when one family member can be accorded refugee status and another, on the same information, is denied it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed to uphold the effective right of conscientious objection on the grounds of religion or belief – a right internationally acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their serious work and commitment on this report, whether we agreed or not. The committee has made positive amendments to the Commission's already sound proposals and I trust this position will be maintained in the vote tomorrow and supported by the Council. A positive position there will be a strong assertion of Treaty obligations and the humanitarian response of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Petitions, as we point out in the explanatory statement, had confidence in the rapporteur we had in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. In other words, we believed that it was not necessary for the Committee on Petitions to produce an extensive report and to present it as if it were a fundamental report, because we had confidence in our rapporteur in the Committee on Freedoms. All I want to say is that we fully support the most important aspects of the rapporteur’s proposal, which improves the European Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we support the fact that there are so many references to the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe because we believe it is closely related to the debate we are holding.</p>
<p class="contents">Also the reference to increasing the rights of asylum seekers and their families, whether or not they be traditional families. We have very clear examples of families which are not traditional but which are extraordinary families.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the capacity for Member States to introduce and maintain certain aspects which are even superior to those laid down in the directive we are debating.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the removal of the paragraph which proposes using semi-public organisations to protect asylum seekers. We believe that only the State can duly protect asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">And non-repatriation in the event that the applicant is at risk of the death penalty or corporal punishment. This Parliament has spoken out very clearly against the death penalty on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Also the reduction in the time limits for enjoying working, educational and childcare rights, as well as the extension of the residency permit.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the establishment of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for those who fail to comply with this directive.</p>

Mr Vitorino, it is you who bear primary responsibility for the fact that, in the course of three years, your House has failed to produce even one single proposal on the right of asylum on which we might come to a compromise. What is even worse is that your House does not yet, for any practical purposes, separate the three pillars of economic migration, asylum rights and subsidiary protection. That is why your proposals regularly end up in the Council's waste paper basket.</p>
<p class="contents">The left-wingers in this House, though, also bear their due share of responsibility for the failures to date. Even the Commission is going beyond the harmonisation of minimum standards, yet, as a matter of principle, the left-wingers keep on making the proposals broader.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing, though, to equal the mendacity involved in you delivering great speeches in this House on asylum policy and allowing yourself to be lauded as the defender of refugees' rights, while your own left-wing governments, in Great Britain and Germany for example, boast about their strict policies on asylum. Even Mr Cohn-Bendit argued on French television last week in favour of tighter regulation. Why? Because, at home, you are subject to quite another kind of public scrutiny, and there you have a responsibility to our citizens, whose capacity for assimilating refugees has limits – limits that you consistently disregard here.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, then, we will be putting our amendments to a vote by roll call in order to expose your hypocrisy to the public gaze.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the report. There is nothing new about your proposal to expand the definition of ‘refugee’ far beyond what is contained in the Geneva Convention. Hitherto, this has always been rejected by us, by the Council, and even by the minister in Germany's red/green government. If you have your way, people receiving subsidiary protection will be treated in almost the same way as recognised asylum seekers. That, though, is quite nonsensical. In Germany, we have known refugees from civil wars not to apply for asylum, because, as a rule, they want to return to their country once the civil war there has ended. Integration in the host country is not for them, nor do they want it in the least. Anyone who demands compulsory schooling for the children of these refugees must need his state of mind examined. Most of these children speak not a word of the host country's language, and you want to have their status reviewed only after five years instead of after one! I can imagine no situation in which the conditions giving entitlement to subsidiary protection are present five years running. No, different groups need different arrangements, and so the Council is right to call for two different approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does this directive again concern itself with the reunification of families? After the first flop that you and the Commission produced here, I wonder if you, Commissioner, are working on a new holistic approach? So what is it to be – an integrated approach or rules in every single proposal? I do not doubt that the Council will chuck this proposal in the dustbin as well. You, though, will in future prefer to talk about open coordination, and will thereby conceal the fact that a European asylum system has been a failure, a failure you yourself provoked.</p>
<p class="contents">Your proposals have a damaging effect on European integration. We reject them and support the amendments tabled by our – and your – chairman, Mr Hernández Mollar.</p>

Indeed, in my view, it is a great credit to the European Union and this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that, in the year 2000, 389 000 people made asylum applications, spread throughout the 15 Member States. Perhaps we should show a degree of humanity and realise that, behind all the speeches that we make in this Chamber, there are men, women and children who are fleeing persecution and conflicts or who are seeking to escape from a life of poverty and deprivation. Have we already forgotten that it is as a result of what we have experienced here in Europe in times of war that we have built up what now constitutes and justifies our presence in this House?</p>
<p class="contents">In our States in crisis, since the events of 11 September, those seeking asylum and international protection have been perceived by many as a threat to law and order, to social stability and even, in some cases, to national security. It is our duty, because we have a duty to remember, because it is the very justification for our existence, because we are essentially a democratic body which defends human rights, to give everyone a chance and to stop the European Union becoming a ‘Fortress Europe’ which is closed to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from other reports already adopted by Parliament, I believe that the proposal before us today makes it possible to establish something that is a real credit to us, in other words an area of freedom, security and justice. Furthermore, in order to introduce some coherence between the regulations and laws of the Member States and to define a platform for common standards, we are establishing, through this proposal for a directive, minimum standards on the definition and scope of the status of refugee. Let this be clear: the minimum standards are not aligned with the lowest common denominator, they do not make it possible to do a U-turn and to seal up Europe, the very place where the Geneva Convention was conceived – it is necessary to point this out again? The main victims of violence, trafficking and mutilation are women and girls. It is necessary, in particular, to ensure that they benefit from assistance, protection and services, and, at the same time, to make these women, who are at the greatest risk from discrimination in their countries of origin, less easy prey for traffickers of human beings or pimps, who deceive them with the offer of trips or visits to our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this proposal for a directive, which seeks, furthermore, to protect these women and children, must enable them to exercise their rights, must enable them to make an asylum application, must enable them to expose the specific forms of persecution that they have endured, because these are, first and foremost, attacks on respect for fundamental rights. It is this, discussions on directives such as this, which justify our continued presence in this Chamber.</p>

The objective was to have common rules adopted that would make the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice. That was the point of departure. Three years after the Tampere meeting, we must now take a practical stand on an important step towards fulfilling that vision. Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are satisfied that our attitudes have been taken into account in the work of the committee. In our view, it is a coherent and well-balanced report that has been presented for debate here in the Chamber. It is important that we obtain common minimum standards for refugees. If the rules are to be effective, it is also important for all the Member States to have a common definition of what a refugee is. I am pleased that the report contains general rules for determining whether or not international protection is properly justified. Today, a number of the Member States have problems related to asylum and immigration policy. Each year, a large number of illegitimate asylum seekers enter the EU. They are a burden on the whole system and a drain upon those resources that could be used for the benefit of those who have real needs. Illegal immigration and people smuggling must be combated, but genuine refugees must be helped. It is this balance for which we must strive and which, in my opinion, the report makes possible. An important prerequisite of its being possible to put this proposal into practice is that we obtain a common definition of refugees with subsidiary protection status. It must be based upon relevant international conventions such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture. I support making the concept of subsidiary protection status a part of the common refugee policy. Asylum policy is one thing, however, and integration something else. It is important for third country nationals to be given the opportunity of making headway with their lives in their new countries. That is something which quite a few EU countries know already. For example, Denmark and Sweden have set to work on active integration policies. The proposal has elements relating to common rights for third country nationals with legal residence in the EU, and these rights must form the basis of a sensible and necessary integration policy. Overall, the report takes a balanced view of the problems with which we are confronted, and I hope that it will be able to attract a broad majority in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Persecution is not always due to political, religious or ethnic reasons however, and the rapporteur is right to condemn the fact that no protection is provided to those – and I quote – ‘who are forced to leave their homes due to poverty’. These people include several hundred thousands who, driven from their homes due to poverty or famine, continue to be persecuted even here, on European soil. They are left to take up poorly paid undeclared labour, are at the mercy of unscrupulous slum landlords and are pursued by the police.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns those people who the national governments do not issue with the requisite papers, which enable them to work and live in dignity. If the European Parliament had a genuine desire to protect those who are persecuted, it should start by doing this within the Union. It should decide, as an emergency measure, to force the national governments to issue residence permits to those in need of them and, failing that, issue them, on behalf of the European institutions, with the requisite papers enabling them to live and work in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the absence of a common European policy on asylum and immigration issues, we are now witnessing unacceptable competition in Europe between all the governments of the various EU Member States, designed to downgrade the conditions for receiving refugees, so as to be the most unwelcoming and the most unattractive, and which also aims to criminalise refugees on the pretext of fighting against phenomena such as illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The French and British Ministers, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Blunkett, are obviously no exception to the rule, and the agreement that they have recently reached in favour of the closure of the Sangatte refugee camp is a tragic illustration of this situation: this agreement seeks primarily to increase the repressive measures and to downgrade reception conditions in Great Britain. Refugees are now tagged, sorted and given a hearing without even having been officially informed of the agreement and the closure plan. Commissioner, this is a question that you could, in my opinion, raise with them with the approval of the UNHCR, which occupies a highly ambiguous position in this scenario. The people of Afghanistan have already demonstrated how strongly they oppose the proposal of EUR 2 000 that they have been offered to return home voluntarily and how insulting this proposal is to them. They are also drawing our attention to their tragic existence in Afghanistan which, if not tragic before the war, would certainly be so on their return home, to their children and their families, but empty-handed, let there be no doubt about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, as regards the right to asylum, many Member States complain that the amount of applications they receive is excessive, condemning the attempts of some asylum applicants to abuse asylum procedures in order to get round Member States’ immigration laws. Indeed, it is essential to make a clear distinction between immigration, illegal immigration, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and the right to asylum, the latter being a right which must retain its valuable, specific status as a human right which must be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the report, pursuing what is supposed to be an open, progressive line of reasoning, widens the definition of the right to asylum – a fundamental right which, as such, cannot have too wide a definition – excessively and inappropriately, first and foremost because those requesting protection and those requesting the status of refugee are, in practice, placed on the same level, and secondly, because the report proposes too wide a definition of the right to asylum granted subsequently to family members too. Indeed, family members eligible for international protection include same-sex partners and partners’ children, and likewise, when it comes to minors, members of a minor’s family other than the minor’s actual parents can be considered to be their parents, and they therefore do not necessarily have to have lived together with the applicant in their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, unless amendments are adopted which make substantial changes to the text, particularly with a view to reducing the scope of the definition of ‘family member’ in the context of the right of family reunification, my group will vote against the motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have one point of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes an asylum system that includes a refugee status and a subsidiary protection status. It thus creates the possibility of treating persons with refugee or subsidiary protection status differently. Given the importance of equal treatment of persons in the EU Member States, it would have been preferable if the Commission had not drawn this distinction. Fortunately, the directive in question concerns minimum harmonisation and Member States may go further when they transpose the directive into national legislation. They are free to give persons with a subsidiary protection status equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lambert Report is keen to extend the Commission's proposal. Although meant well, the proposed amendments will, in my view, in fact, hamper the proper implementation of the directive on account of their subjective content. Accordingly, an asylum seeker must be given the benefit of the doubt when he makes conflicting statements as a result of traumatic experiences. In evaluating whether fear of persecution is real, consideration must be given to the gender, sexual identity, sexual orientation and health of the refugee and the habits and customs in a country. The Member States should retain a certain level of policy freedom. In addition, a workable system requires that the officials who carry out the policy should have a certain level of discretion. The proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unnecessarily restrict this discretion. They will at best lead to more bureaucracy and less freedom in the assessment of individual cases. I will therefore not be endorsing these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This text constantly seeks to broaden the definition of refugees provided by the Geneva Convention. For example, the persecutor does not, from now on, always have to be a State, it could also be a non-State organisation. To take another example, the probable causes of persecution have been drafted in a broad and open manner, as acknowledged in the Explanatory Statement itself, which explains, for example, that a person, persecuted on account of membership of a social group, may also be persecuted on the grounds of sex or sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all, however. The proposal for a directive creates a whole new category, subsidiary protection, which is in addition to the status of refugee provided for under the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, I believe that we must stop. There are many – often tragic – crises in the world that we have a duty to attempt to alleviate. The countries of the European Union cannot receive any more refugees, however. How many refugees, by the way? We do not know. The text gives no evaluation. What will be the financial burden for the taxpayer? It is a mystery. We do not know. No evaluation is proposed for this either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strange, nonetheless, that, at a time when the Member States are seeking to put a stop to bogus asylum applications – which have become the main source of illegal immigration – the Commission is, for its part, trying to open the floodgates. This is not a responsible course of action. We, for our part, believe that our main task is to protect our people.</p>
<p class="contents">In such circumstances, the communitarisation of the immigration policy at Amsterdam, giving the Commission a monopoly on initiative after 2004, would appear to be a serious mistake. If the Member States do not want to pay a high price, they must find a way to change this situation during the next intergovernmental conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Between the rapporteur's approach and that of the European People's Party, however, there are fundamental differences.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these differences? You propose a common approach to dealing with subsidiary protection and the protection accorded to refugees. We are opposed to that; we want separate directives. You propose extension of protection far beyond the bounds set by the Geneva Convention. We want the Geneva Convention retained. You want to take family reunification much further than consensus in this House has previously allowed. We want the nuclear family. You want to grant subsidiary protection, for five years and with a residence permit, immediately. That does not make sense, so we want protection to be given for as long as it is reasonably needed. So it is that the measures you are presenting here do not ensure that help is speedily given to real refugees under the Geneva Convention, but rather incite the use of asylum for immigration by economic migrants, and that tends towards its misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">What we find lacking in the Lambert Report, though, are primarily calls for quick procedures enabling us to decide in the minimum of time who is a refugee and who has a chance of asylum. At present, that amounts in any case to some 90% of applicants for asylum. Your report contains no reference to an EU-wide list of safe third states and states of origin. It contains nothing about applicants being required to go back if they are not given permission to remain, nor does it contain measures to ensure that they do so. Nor does it contain any demand for the European Union to conclude agreements with third countries, countries of origin and transit countries, to take applicants back. Finally, it contains no firm demand that Dublin II be used to prevent asylum shopping.</p>
<p class="contents">In so many respects does this report contradict our thinking that I have to say that the European People's Party is unable to support it unless the relevant changes are made.</p>

This is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members are criticising efforts to bring into line the status of refugee and that of beneficiary of subsidiary protection. Subsidiary protection exists, however, to bridge the gaps found in some interpretations of the Geneva Convention, under which a refugee is defined as a person persecuted by a government. Yet we know that some refugees who are not, strictly speaking, persecuted by their government, are, in fact, in real danger and in genuine need of our help.</p>
<p class="contents">The needs of all those requiring international protection are, by and large, the same. This is precisely the area the committee worked on to have amended in the proposal for a directive and I believe this has been done in a very constructive manner. As an improvement, it is proposed that refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection enjoy the same rights with regard to the granting and the length of the residence permit, access to employment, possibilities of vocational training and access to integration facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that access to employment encourages people to acquire greater autonomy and enables those concerned to support themselves and thus, to live without the assistance provided by the host country. It is obvious that minors benefiting from international protection must have full access to the state education system; this is an obvious fact recognised in several international conventions. We believe that it is dangerous to fail to protect minors, to fail to educate them, to fail to give them the minimum they need to be able to live together.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the new definition of the term family members, which is both wider and more accurate, and we stress the possibility of family reunion that is introduced in the proposal. Similarly, we welcome the fact that the rejection of refugee status, and its withdrawal, is more clearly defined. We are pleased to note that the persons who are persecuted for their sexual orientation, for their state of health, who suffer corporal punishment or genital mutilation are protected. I now urge the majority of forward-thinking, humanist Members, who are often a credit to Parliament, to reject the amendments which could completely change the nature of this report and to send a clear signal to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of the Lambert Report tomorrow, we shall be responding to an expectation of our peoples. Whoever votes against this text tomorrow can no longer claim to truly condemn the current reception conditions which are not worthy of humanity, which are not worthy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This implies, though, that secondary migration, in other words, the misuse of asylum to which Mr Vitorino referred, will thereby be kept under control. So, Mrs Lambert, the prime requirement when it comes to dealing with economic migrants is support for impoverished countries, in order to prevent human resources from haemorrhaging away through emigration and to promote economic growth with a better quality of life for the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of asylum is seen as sensitive in all the Member States, as is shown by the fact that it has been impossible, to date, to get any of the previous draft directives on this subject adopted by the Council. I therefore regard the rapporteur's approach, which involves extending the already very far-reaching Commission proposal still further, as being quite utterly wrong. It may soothe our own conscience to grant asylum also on economic grounds, but it does not help this Parliament to be taken seriously in our Member States. The proposals for extending the scope of asylum to citizens of the European Union show how some MEPs regard ideologies as more important than sensible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Solutions, though, are what the citizens of our countries have every right to expect. We and the people in our Member States are of one mind in believing that those who are persecuted must be given humanitarian aid. This does not mean, however, that the granting of asylum can solve all this world's social, economic or environmental problems. On the contrary, that leads to the great benefit of the right to asylum being nullified.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the representatives of the people, have the task of finding pragmatic solutions, on the one hand for the European Union, and on the other for the asylum-seekers. A forward-looking asylum policy in the EU must also take into account the circumstances and needs of the people in our Member States. The report before us does nothing of the sort, and so the PPE-DE Group rejects it.</p>

We all, probably, have different opinions on it. In my own country, Germany, there could also be difficulties as regards the way we handle the reunification of families, if the whole thing is framed in such generous terms that we, in Germany, perhaps have to tackle it in a different way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, though, it is of course a good thing that we at last have a directive, or are at least making the attempt to lay down minimum standards, which, once in place, will enable us to achieve our objective of preventing secondary movement. I can understand my fellow-Members from other groups not being in agreement with all points, but I would also remind you that we are delegates. I am not a minister of a nation state, and am therefore not obliged to take a stringent line and consider how to persuade and convince my Danish or Dutch counterparts. I am a member of a Parliament in which I enjoy the freedom to act according to my conscience, a Parliament in which I can contemplate visions and draft proposals about them. I can frame my ideas in such broad terms that, in the final analysis, they do not absolutely have to be passed by a Council in the form of a directive, but can be a parliamentary position paper and an eventual contribution to discussion. It is in this sense that I hope that we will pass this draft tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recently, at the Estoril meeting, the PPE-DE Group attached importance to these matters by holding their own seminar on this issue, the conclusions of which were reproduced a short while ago by Mr Pirker. We agree with a common asylum policy that contains minimum rules designed to ensure a minimum level of protection for persons in genuine need of it. We also agree with the aim of restricting the secondary movements of asylum seekers by reducing the differences that exist between the legislation and practices of the various Member States in this field, as well as imposing a fair division of efforts between the States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that refugees, like any persons benefiting from other forms of protection, should be able to live with dignity in the Community of which they are a part, which can only happen if we protect their personal and social rights. In these matters, however, it is better to move slowly and appropriately rather than rapidly and get things wrong. Policies that appear to be very generous end up creating feelings of rejection and increasing xenophobic reactions that we can only condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">Even following 11 September, we have seen, amongst the public, suspect attitudes and increasing hostility towards asylum seekers, refugees and immigrant communities. From this point of view, we must acknowledge that the Lambert Report has not helped to generate the consensus that would be useful and desirable in these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Without wishing to dramatise, Mr President, this proposal contains a core of minimum standards that reveal the legislative courage to respond effectively to the issue of citizens of third countries in need of international protection, at the same time eliminating national differences in the way in which persons are treated, avoiding the need for secondary movements. This, at least, is our view.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to highlight an extremely positive aspect of the Commission proposal, which is the complementarity of the dual status of international protection in which, in addition to the narrow approaches of the 1950s, the concept is extended to subsidiary protection, clarifying the concept of the perpetrators of persecution not limited solely to the State and its agents but also to material circumstances and others in which the outcome is that the State does not give protection, either because it cannot or because it does not want to, and we can all recall such situations in Africa and in Latin America. We also have the concept’s inclusion of the protection organisations of stable quasi-State authorities, which must be held responsible in practical terms for the protection of individuals who fall outside the scope of simple peace or military security missions, which often relegate into second place the effective protection of individuals and respect for human rights. Lastly, extending refugees’ rights in terms of periods of residence, employment and integration mechanisms, which concern every aspect of refugees’ citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence arising from poverty and from other social scourges is not included but I hope that this will be covered in future by means of a broader concept of common asylum policy. For the moment, however, a good part of the ground has been covered, as have the bases for a common European asylum policy. The Commission should, in our opinion, be congratulated on its work, but the Council must not continue to defraud us, demonstrating its congenital inability to take a decision, as is traditional and as usually happens in these matters. Nor, Commissioner, will the Council be receiving from this House, from this Parliament, an endorsement for its inefficiency, ineffectiveness and for failing to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to respond to a few of the points that have been raised in the debate this evening. The first point concerns Mr von Boetticher's contribution, the first of the right-wing Christian Democrat hit-and-run contributors. He hits out at the left in the Parliament, he hits out at the governments in the United Kingdom and Germany, and then he runs out of the Chamber so that he cannot hear the debate. He runs away from the debate and he runs away from the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that there are millions of people in the world who are seeking sanctuary in the European Union. It is a situation that needs a sympathetic response. It needs Member States to look at the situation and to try to address the position with compassionate moves. This is why my group on this side of the Chamber makes no apologies for supporting a common European asylum policy, believing that it is the only way forward for the European Union. I say to those Members opposite who say they are going to vote against these measures tomorrow and who, like Mr Coelho and Mrs Klamt, have said nice things about a common European asylum policy: you cannot say nice things about it on one occasion and then, every time there is a vote, vote it down.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pirker has spelled out the objections but it is not being consistent when one Member of your group, Mr Helmer, is writing that they should end the automatic rights or end the Geneva Convention and end the automatic right of entry for those deemed to be suffering from persecution. We need to be absolutely clear where they are coming from. On this side we are quite clear in our approach. We will support this report. We very much believe that there need to be minimum standards. There need to be proper standards for asylum seekers, to recognise that they are invariably desperate people seeking desperate measures to escape from the appalling situations in their own countries. We should be compassionate in the role that we seek to play. We should be compassionate in our reports. That is why I am very happy to commend the rapporteur on this and to congratulate the Commissioner for bringing it forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this debate, which has raised some extremely important questions, to which I should like to respond. Firstly, the Commission unequivocally defends the primacy of the implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention, which is binding on all Member States. We have also covered rules on subsidiary protection and, on this matter, I should like to put Mr Berthu’s mind at ease: we have created nothing new; this is not the invention of a Commissioner’s Machiavellian mind. Subsidiary protection is already in place in our fifteen Member States. It arises from international commitments given by these countries, for example, when they signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the criteria laid down in its Article 3.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the scope of this directive, I should like to say that the Commission does not accept the proposals for amendments tabled by some Members, seeking to add new grounds or to add an exhaustive list of exclusion clauses for the definition of a refugee under the Geneva Convention. We cannot accept these because the European Union does not have the authority to amend the content of the Geneva Convention. It can only be amended with the agreement of the 150 States that are parties to it. This process has been opened by the United Nations High Commissioner but we are not in a position unilaterally to amend the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we believe that the proposals on procedural guarantees, as generous as they are, should not be included in this directive. The issue of procedures should be dealt with in the proposal on that subject, on which the Commission has tabled an amended proposal. By the same token, I wish to say to Mr Pirker that this is not the proper place in which to deal with issues of return, the Dublin II Regulation, or cooperation with third countries. These issues are important, I agree with you – and the Commission will be working on them, as indicated at the Seville Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, therefore, the Commission tabled four new proposals for negotiating readmission agreements with Turkey, Algeria, Albania and the People’s Republic of China. Over a year ago, the Commission presented a regulation on which State should be held responsible for studying asylum requests, known as the ‘Dublin II Regulation’, which, I hope, will be concluded by the end of this year and the Commission will, in November, present its action plan for returns policy, as well as a framework for financial action for cooperation with third countries in the fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of equal rights amongst refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the Commission believes that the rights pertaining to the beneficiaries of these two different types of protection must be the same. We feel, however, that there should be a ‘cooling-off’ period and, therefore, we proposed that there should be a distinction, precisely in order to acknowledge the primacy of the implementation of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, why did we include subsidiary protection in this proposal? Let us be quite clear about this. Today, in all Member States of the European Union, the majority of persons receiving international protection do not receive this protection under the Geneva Convention but under systems of subsidiary protection. And if we wish to combat secondary movements, if we wish to combat ‘asylum shopping’ it would be of little value merely to include only the Geneva Convention. The essence of ‘asylum shopping’, the essence of secondary movements lies in the competitiveness of subsidiary protection systems, to which we can add – please forgive me for saying so, ladies and gentlemen – that it is unfair to accuse the Commission of extending the concept of economic refugees by means of subsidiary protection. On the contrary, only by dealing with the harmonisation of subsidiary protection will it be possible to adopt the so-called single procedure, which has been welcomed, as a matter of fact, by an increasing number of Member States, in which requests for asylum are studied in order of priority in a single administrative process and are subject to a single final decision. This is known as ‘streamlining procedures’. This is a way of rationalising procedures that saves time, administrative means and money without having to provide unnecessary resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, Mr von Boetticher claimed that I bear a major responsibility for this matter and in doing so paid me a compliment which I really do not deserve. It is not the Commission proposals that are blocking the Council’s decision-making ability. I must tell you sincerely that this is an area in which the Member States have initiative of legislation. Can Mr von Boetticher have asked himself why if, in these matters, the Commission proposals are as bad as he says, no Member State has tabled a proposal that has rapidly achieved the consensus of the fifteen Member States and has been adopted? This is an issue which I believe is relevant. The only innovation in this proposal, admittedly, is to extend the concept of cause of persecution to cover persecution by non-State actors. This is true. This is the situation in thirteen of the fifteen Member States, and has recently also been incorporated into German law. Am I really the most appropriate target for Mr von Boetticher’s words? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
