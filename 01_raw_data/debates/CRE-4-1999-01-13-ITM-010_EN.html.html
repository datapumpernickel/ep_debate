<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Malerba </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two Commission communications which are the subject of my report – one on the need for strengthened international coordination in the information society and the other, related to it, on the problem of an international framework of management for the Internet – raise specific points and also outline a method for addressing the challenges, legal ones in the main, which the Internet revolution has brought about.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new about the Internet that cannot be regulated merely by extending the rules already in force for the other media? This is a valid question. My answer is that the Internet really is a new, revolutionary technological product; its advent is on a par with the invention of the printing press. Television, print and radio messages are one‐way, broadcast indiscriminately to an audience without the means to interact. In contrast, the Internet changes the way we distribute information in two fundamental respects: every message can become highly participatory, while the distribution costs of information, on a worldwide basis, fall almost to zero. Whereas in general the traditional broadcasting media are tightly regulated, on the Internet anyone can become a publisher and engage in dialogue with his readership. There are no central points of control and no access barriers; no special licences are required to get on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet is still in its infancy, but statistics show that participation is growing exponentially. Whereas a few years ago it was predicted that by 1998 there would be three million users in Europe, when 1998 came we realised that there were already 18 million, and this growth is still continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">As the new method of electronic data interchange develops, so do new forms of corporate organisation, looking ahead to the economy of the future. Hierarchies are disappearing, production plant and physical processes are no longer concentrated in a fixed location, as was typical of the industrial era; a new knowledge‐based society is emerging, one which is more mobile both geographically and culturally.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be argued that highly complex organisations, such as the information society and interactive IT networks, should be regulated not from the centre but from the periphery, as happens in the biological world. Simple laws are imprinted into every cell of an organism without there being a single central control unit. Order is maintained through the interaction of a huge number of individual entities, linked together by a close network of connections and reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">A pragmatic and flexible approach to the Internet phenomenon would therefore appear judicious. I believe that Mr Bangemann deserves credit for his far‐sightedness and perseverance in pursuing the policy of liberalising telecommunications services in Europe. It is for this reason that we are not now fazed by this new challenge. When, at the Bonn Conference in July 1997, the Americans proposed the promotion of world‐wide electronic commerce, Europe was able to respond in the same vein, reasserting the principles of user protection and free access for all citizens, personal data protection and security of communication, fiscal non‐discrimination where new technologies are used for electronic rather than traditional commerce, and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is ample evidence of the need for international coordination, ranging from domain name management to the risk of a US monopoly, to the German judiciary's initiatives concerning providers' real or presumed responsibilities, not forgetting the risk of a proliferation of dissimilar legislation from one country to another as electronic commerce gradually gains ground. I would stress that our aim here is certainly not to define and list all the crimes to which the Internet potentially lends itself – although the media tend to focus mostly on these aspects – but rather to draw up a code of conduct making this new tool more secure and reliable to use.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, dialogue can be established at various levels, involving industry and content providers, and multilateral agreements can be sought not only with the United States but also with Japan, India and any other countries embarking on electronic commerce. This multi‐layer, multilateral dialogue must recognise the competence of international organisations in individual fields, and the private sector and professional and users' associations must be involved in laying down the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What can Parliament do? As well as giving encouragement and support to the Commission's international initiatives, I believe that Parliament should place this item on the agendas of its interparliamentary delegations, especially the one with the US Congress, and should continue working to raise public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Commission, it must finalise and put forward for adoption in 1999 – before the end of this parliamentary term – a substantial set of rules governing electronic commerce. We have observed the Commissioner's initiatives with industry in Brussels, at the OECD conference in Ottawa and at the Aspen Institute meeting in Lyons. I should now like to hear him comment on the state of play.</p>

The committee has already said in earlier opinions that it is the authorities" task to achieve agreement on an international legislative framework that is transparent, clear, technology‐neutral, non‐discriminatory and likely to stimulate competition. It is important that the entire business community should be involved, as at the round‐table conference on 29 July last year in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The business steering committee set up recently by Commissioner Bangemann fortunately recognises this principle and includes representatives of firms from around the world. There is a tremendous amount of work to do when you think of protecting intellectual property, the problems of encryption, data protection, liability and so on. Parliament must be closely involved in drafting legislation, whether binding or not, and in particular must be closely involved in any future conferences on the subject. The information society has enormous implications for the public and for businesses in terms of well‐being, employment and prosperity, so democratic controls are absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me on to my final point. The Commission"s proposal for a new directive designed to improve the climate for electronic trade on the Internet in Europe has come not a moment too soon for the European Union, or perhaps even a little late. If we compare the European Union"s performance in the field of electronic trade with that of the United States, we are forced to concede that the European Union is already lagging behind. In December alone online spending in the United States grew by 230 %, the sort of figure that many firms in Europe can only dream about. I thank Mr Malerba for his excellent report.</p>

<p class="contents">The fact that transactions are increasingly international has led to certain conflicts over jurisdiction. These involve matters such as the terms and conditions to be used in cross‐border contracts, liability for third parties, the labour laws affecting teleworkers – even in cross‐border transactions – copyright, and so on. These are all matters that affect the reliability of transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, establishing a safe framework for businesses and consumers to operate in is essential in resolving these conflicts. But it should be possible to achieve this objective if, on the one hand, the open access nature of the Internet is preserved and, on the other hand, the plurality and diversity of the network is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing controls, barriers or licences for access to the Internet could be dangerous, and the jurisdiction of one sole country such as the United States becoming too widespread would be equally dangerous. In my view, security must be compatible with freedom and limits should only be set in order to protect the public interest, with all that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed International Charter would be a good idea, but Parliament should be involved in the debate surrounding it.</p>

<p class="contents">In adopting Mrs Ewing"s opinion unanimously, our committee showed itself to be less keen on this project to create an Internet charter than the European Commission and Parliament"s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. Whilst our committee agrees with the European Commission on the universal nature of information networks, which transcend regional, national and European borders and require an international response, it does not agree with the Commission"s analysis of the legal and technical nature of the problems created by the globalisation of the information society. The Committee on Culture believes that our approach to the development of these new digital technologies is a mistake. We believe the current approach, which seeks to make the regulation of electronic commerce a priority in the development of the information society, is effectively giving preference to a constricting policy which is geared solely to competitiveness and which fails to appreciate the extent of social and cultural change.</p>
<p class="contents">How can you think the new information technologies will benefit the greatest number of people, will help to reduce inequality of opportunities, if you do not take account of the risks they create? I am thinking in particular of the dangers we have already mentioned in many of our resolutions in this House: the danger that cultural and linguistic diversity will be marginalised, the danger that inequalities between urban areas and rural and peripheral regions will widen further.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the plan to create a world economic area, barely disguised in the electronic commerce sector, it seems to me that the European Commission and our Economic Affairs Committee underestimate how far ahead the United States is in the technology and how far it is commercially dominant in the information sector and the Internet, accounting for more than 80 % of the world market in computers, software and electronic banking services. Presenting this draft agreement to you as legally non‐binding, whether it is or not, will not change the current situation in any way. It will only benefit the multinationals, Microsoft today, Netscape or Sun Microsystems tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Committee on Culture believes – you can shake your head, Mr Bangemann, but this is what our committee believes – that the priority for the European Union should be to address the technology gap between itself and the USA, and to put in place not an umpteenth policy of protectionism, as some Member States are tempted to do, but a coordinated and dynamic European multimedia policy by stimulating a market centred on European products and services, facilitating their spread throughout the territory of the Union, in association with the most innovative small businesses – in short, by using European skills in this area to maximum advantage. After this first stage, these new technologies should also be placed at the service of the citizen, to encourage cultural and linguistic diversity and to further the development of general‐interest networks. Only in this way will the myth of a European model of the information society become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The 12 amendments which the ARE Group has tabled to Mr Malerba"s report reflect the main concerns expressed by the Committee on Culture and seek more broadly to offer concrete proposals to ensure that the European Union does not continue to lag behind in this battle.</p>

It is a matter of information, which is refined into data, then perception and realisation, and finally culture and education: information is only a raw material. Its content, however, is of the essence. Our problem is no longer one of transmitters or receivers, computers or hardware. Content is the area where the European Union has fallen behind, compared with its competitors. Content also provides employment and is very profitable. You could say there was no end of uses for content, just as with food, such as the sausage, for example. People can in practice enjoy content in an infinite number of ways.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission"s initiative for international action and a charter for the Internet and electronic commerce. The Internet cannot work beyond the reach of the law and standards. A crime is a crime on the Internet too, and that we must be aware of. Apart from that, one advantage of electronic commerce is that the location is safe. Rules, however, must not hinder developments, but lead and alter, and be flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there must be cooperation. I believe that the United States is very keen to reach an agreement with us, as they have both economic and political interests. Apart from companies and consumers, it is important that everyone should have access to this system. It is a modern European Union"s civil right and we will hold on to it. Nevertheless, it cannot be exempt from taxation.</p>

The myth of an information‐based society has become a reality. Information is now the key to everything, turning us into listed consumers of classified products. Virtual reality is the order of the day, mesmerising us into accepting our collective loss of freedom on a global scale. We are now ruled by the drug of information and all its consequences. Thinking is in binary form: I buy – yes or no; I sell – this or that; my opinion – left or right.</p>
<p class="contents">The information drug has invaded our daily lives and we are now even calling for computer police. The Internet revolution, due to its extraordinary potential, has developed into a massive free‐for‐all involving every type of deceit, fraud and abuse. Consumers are being violated and the applicable law is contradictory, incoherent or even non‐existent. The central issue now for an information society in which electronic commerce is assuming a previously unimaginable dimension is to urgently establish, by worldwide consensus, the main economic groups of the world and the respective leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to provide a solid and coherent legal framework that can regulate the activity of the information networks. Using the argument of American supremacy in the electronic commerce sector to exclude Europe from being a pioneer in the creation of this new global economic space, as recommended by the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth Education and the Media, is an unrealistic attitude. It implies that we should stick our heads in the sand and ignore or refuse to understand the major changes in the world today.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks of cultural and linguistic marginalisation and of outlying or rural areas becoming more isolated are real. It is obvious that the disparity between north and south has increased in the last few decades despite economic growth. Nothing can prevent the world of one‐way messages becoming a world of two‐way communication via the Internet where everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster simultaneously. Trying to ignore this change is as futile as trying to stop the tide coming in.</p>

In my view, the problem lies in the fact that we are trying to find a balance between the right to freedom of information and the difficulties we are facing in connection with the right to freedom of information, the right to freedom of electronic commerce, etc. And we are facing difficulties, as everyone must agree, to do with tax, liability, the protection of information and information of a harmful or illegal nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us is to introduce a non‐binding international charter. The fact that the charter is non‐binding indicates where the seat of the problem lies. We want to regulate a number of matters, but it is precisely in trying to establish the right to free trade and freedom of information, as I said earlier, that it is extremely difficult to restrict a number of things that we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should all welcome the fact that this proposal has been made and that we are going to reach a number of agreements, but agreements must never be so strictly defined that they infringe the rights of the individual. As I see it, the information society is partly a way of encouraging individuals, states and so on to make responsible choices. What we now have to recognise is that a number of countries that have up to now been accustomed to regulating certain matters within their own borders are now no longer able to do so because of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the Commissioner success with this charter. It is a very brave effort, but it is going to be extremely difficult to find a balance between what we want and what we do not want.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schörling </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the Green Group, including myself, agrees with the Commission and its Members when they say that there is no need for a global regulatory framework, nor a new international authority to regulate the Internet. Above all, we do not need an information police. We now have the chance to come up with a viable solution, as I believe the rapporteur, Mr Malerba, has also recognised in his report when he calls for cooperation. That is what is needed, not legal regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Any agreement reached between the different countries should not be legally binding, but more on the lines of a code of conduct or, in the words of the rapporteur, a kind of highway code for the Internet. I think that such an approach would find support, since a code of this type is needed to safeguard privacy, copyright and security. We have also tabled some amendments which address the need to resolve this issue, not only from the point of view of the international organisations, but in a way that takes account of the interests of commercial undertakings, consumer associations and so on, and which also protects the interests of the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the ARE Group has put forward a proposal with which we absolutely cannot agree, since we regard it as protectionist. However, they have also tabled some amendments relating to the interests of the general public which we can support. We would also like to remind you that this is not just about Europe and the USA; we must ensure that the Internet becomes a truly global and democratic highway that everyone can use.</p>

It enables the people and the elected representatives of Europe to engage in a debate which, as we know, has major implications for society and I know that Commissioner Bangemann is personally very aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">So for me the proposed text is a starting‐point for our shared deliberations, but we all know that it cannot be an end in itself. The idea of a global charter is interesting and I am in favour of it, even if it cannot answer all the challenges entailed in developing new communication tools. The priority for all of us is to move our European cooperation forward as fast as we can, so that we are better placed to negotiate from a position of greater strength with our major partner, the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur on the question of electronic commercial transactions and his desire to protect the consumer or user by means of secure systems of payment and the respecting of civil liberties. At the same time, I think our European debate has to go further than that. The faster pace of economic processes, new forms of work, is creating complex problems. These are challenging the systems of social relationships we have in Europe. The information revolution is breaking down the ways in which society orders itself, and at the same time communication, the degree of information, is breaking down all the hierarchies, including those within businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">So although international agreement is necessary, I believe we must do more to ensure consistency with social and business legislation. We must never forget, Mr President, that the new technologies and the Internet are tools. After that comes the question of knowing what to do with them, and to what end.</p>

A few days ago, the euro was introduced; frontiers are disappearing. These are good signs, I feel. Nowadays we can use our European‐manufactured mobile phone to ring home from Moscow or Malaysia; we can link up directly to the Internet. The world is in fact coming together faster than some people are willing to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulatory systems vary around the globe, so we need to come forward with ideas on how best to strengthen international coordination in this area too. Markets will want to know what the rules of play are. Drawing these up is primarily the job of policy‐makers, but it is essential that we involve users and manufacturers. All three sides will need to sit around the table.</p>
<p class="contents">We must first of all establish the current state of play and then move to develop ways of achieving our chosen goals. Mr Malerba illustrates the situation very well in his report. Member States have considerable scope for shaping the information society, but need to bear in mind the extent to which previously separate sectors are moving closer to one another. This is where the challenge lies. We should be envisaging setting up virtual libraries – places open to everyone, just as traditional libraries are. A click of the mouse will suffice, but people must be aware that the virtual library exists. The benefit in terms of knowledge and experience will be enormous. And think of the boost for industry if concerted efforts are put into making this vision a reality.</p>

I am referring in particular to resolving the problems posed by the Internet domain names, and here I believe the Commission has chosen the right way forward. Furthermore, our approach to the whole issue has changed since the initiative was first introduced. We are not just dealing with a highway, there are many other areas where regulation is needed, either by means of legislation, rules or standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we have also taken forward the debate on the information society. We should therefore avoid statements like the one we heard last night about Europe being so far behind America. In fact, Europe has also made progress in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Two issues that were agreed and discussed recently give some cause for concern. Why did Europe go along with the so‐called amendment of the Wassenaar Convention which makes it more difficult for us to export encryption techniques, and what part did the Commission play in this? And the second is, of course, that there has still been no agreement on the UMTS standard. What is needed here is continued vigilance and discussion. We cannot accept that protecting our interests is the answer; there must be a solution that is to everyone's advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that the transatlantic dialogue has been useful and that there has been some degree of convergence. Many people believe that it is important to combine the European and American approaches. We have also seen that there is not always total independence in the USA, but that there is possibly more administrative regulation because of the federal system, which raises more obstacles than there are in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that Commissioner Bangemann has done a very good job in this field simply by encouraging dialogue. I am one of those who hope he will keep up the good work.</p>

We are confronted daily with new communications technologies; these are penetrating ever deeper into all areas of our lives. Care must be taken with regard to competition law, however. We do not want to see it undermined. Globalisation and the information society influence not only industrial and cultural policy; the impact on human rights is considerable too. I am disappointed, therefore, to see that combating Internet crime is accorded such marginal treatment. The Internet is being misused for the purposes of spreading child pornography; child abuse is happening online; and trafficking in children is even being organised over the net. Society has a massive problem here.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be giving its full attention to this baser side of globalisation. Greater international cooperation between administrative authorities and more financial resources are called for.</p>

There is in fact a broad consensus and my thanks go to the rapporteur, who has made a big effort to absorb the logic and rationale of our proposal. As a result, the analysis given in his report is very much to the point.</p>
<p class="contents">I should perhaps remind people, however, that today"s discussion touches on only one element of the information society. Just because we are focusing at present on electronic commerce and the Internet does not mean that other important aspects are being neglected. What a pity that, yet again, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media is coming out with the same old clichés. Its members preach their blinkered cultural pessimism and then depart, depriving anyone else of the chance to lighten their darkness.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture and open debate go together; in German, we even speak of a ‘culture of debate". The information society has now entered that debate, and committees such as Economic and Monetary Affairs, or Research, Technological Development and Energy, or Foreign Affairs – with its Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament – are demonstrating more receptiveness towards this new cultural phenomenon than the culturally‐challenged Committee on Culture, which cannot seem to grasp what is at stake. The same old arguments have been wheeled out regarding the negative impact on minority languages and small or medium‐sized companies. But if ever there was a ‘small‐friendly" technology, it is the Internet. The new developments offer global exposure to smaller languages and small businesses at a fraction of the previous cost. Much to my dismay, however, the Culture Committee fails to see this. I have attended their meetings two or three times and, on each occasion, I came up against a brick wall.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hear repeated reference to US domination. Mrs Thors rightly pointed out that this a red herring. Thanks to the Internet Charter, Europe has taken a global lead. We have been successful on domain names, as Mrs Thors also noted. There is a danger, however, that people will begin to believe all this constant talk of how America has got poor little Europe pinned against the wall. But it has not, and our progress can only be undermined if this is the message coming across. I am therefore grateful to you for having stated clearly that you believe we are making headway.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Malerba asked about the current state of play and where we go next. Of course, Parliament will be involved in the whole process. Anyone wishing to attend the conferences has an open invitation to do so. Mr Malerba and other Members have participated in such events in the past, and we very much hope that this practice will continue</p>
<p class="contents">The familiar problem raised by Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak has to be seen in the light of the speed of technological advance and the inherently global nature of the Internet. When things are happening fast, legislation is not easy. Regulations which we adopted at the outset are already in need of review; keeping pace with these developments is extraordinarily difficult. That is why we are seeking to devise alternative‐style legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element in the equation is the global dimension of this technology. Even if we do decide to enact directives at EU level, these have no impact beyond the frontiers of the Member States; hence the need for political agreement with other legal areas on equivalent approaches. The Internet Charter is a move in that direction, and it has taken off internationally. We have also been involved in promoting the Global Business Dialogue, which has been officially launched in Brussels. A management board has now been appointed and is currently, as I understand it, holding a two‐day meeting in New York. Moreover, a conference will be taking place in September at which consideration will be given to the possibility of self‐regulation. The interested parties will either agree to sort out the problems amongst themselves or, where this proves impossible, will seek to find the most appropriate solutions. The OECD meeting in Ottawa produced a list of some 12 to 15 problem issues, many of which can only be resolved through political decisions. Taxation matters obviously cannot be left to the parties directly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we afford to leave questions such as encryption to the sectoral players alone. And I would point out that no decisions have so far been taken on which of the various possible systems will be authorised. Some thought was given to the matter at a meeting of justice and home affairs ministers, but no statutory provisions have been adopted. Until Parliament and the Council have been consulted on a Commission proposal, no legislative act can be envisaged. We all know that. And there is as yet no Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are similar issues with regard to intellectual property; legislative decisions are required. The idea is that this conference should prepare the ground; we will then come forward with proposals for decisions. The Japanese are already convinced of the need to initiate a political process to parallel the one whereby private interests are working to find a suitable accommodation. It now remains for us to win over the Americans; we shall then be in a position to respond at international level to the ideas emerging from the private sector"s deliberations. All in all, I think it is fair to say that we are satisfied with the progress of events. May I once again express my gratitude for your understanding and positive input. I know that you have high expectations of me over the coming months – and thank you for your good wishes. I take it that I may hold out some hope for tomorrow"s vote!</p>
