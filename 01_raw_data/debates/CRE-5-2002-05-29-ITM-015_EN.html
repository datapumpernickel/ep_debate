In June 2001 the Commission declared that its negotiations with South Korea had failed and recommended to the Council and Parliament to launch a WTO procedure to be accompanied by time-limited protection measures in favour of Europe's shipbuilding sector, which is in great danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament voted in favour of this procedure and also recommended including gas tankers in these protection measures. A study by the Commission is now available on the competitive position for various types of shipbuilding and in particular gas tankers. This study has now been transmitted to the Council. I have several questions for the Commissioner regarding this brief summary of the position. Firstly, when will the study be made available to Parliament and to the public? Secondly, does the study confirm the need to launch a WTO procedure against South Korea? Thirdly, are there differences of opinion about the study within the Commission? Fourthly, when will the Commission launch the WTO procedure, and will it continue to provide for the introduction of protection measures for sectors which have suffered damage?</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth question is how many jobs have been put at risk in Europe because of this distortion in competition. Sixth, how many jobs have already been lost because no WTO measures have been introduced over the last two years and no accompanying protection measures have been taken? My seventh question is how many orders the European shipbuilding industry has lost over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">My final question, Commissioner, is how you regard the situation and the discussions held by the Council on this subject. Mrs Riis-Jørgensen is here with us and the situation in the Council seems to be similar to that in Parliament. There are great controversies raging in the Member States as to whether the Commission has come up with an appropriate procedure, as on the one hand it is proposing to launch a WTO procedure and on the other it is intending to offset this with protection measures. The overwhelming majority of this House considered, when we voted on the Riis-Jørgensen report, that this was the right approach. I assume that there will continue to be an overwhelming majority for this in future, but I still wish to ask the Commissioner to give us some information on what measures he proposes, and to explain this to the Council as part of the new discussions now that the study has been transmitted to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here we are again discussing shipbuilding and the unfair practices of South Korea in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that while we are here splitting hairs, Korean shipyards will be working at full capacity. I would also like to point out that this discussion on the unfair practices of this Asian country began in 1998 and so far no action has been taken against the Republic of South Korea, but rather we spend time discussing whether or not it is a good idea to include one category or another in the defence mechanism, which the European Commission designed nearly two years ago. I do not think I am wrong in saying that at this rate we will end up including pleasure boats.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that in November 2001 in this House we approved the inclusion of gas carriers, ferries and boats for the transport of motor vehicles, which is part of the complaint to the WTO, but they were not included in the defence mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Surprisingly, that proposal did not receive the necessary support from the Council, so the whole matter is still on hold, which is truly shameful. I would like to call for solidarity between the countries of the European Union, the same solidarity on which we have built this community of Europe and which in recent times appears to have faded, because without it, European shipbuilders will soon have disappeared, and we will be accountable to thousands of families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the request of European industry, the Commission has launched an update of its Trade Barrier Regulation investigation which has just been concluded. The Commission took note of the findings of the TBR report at its session on 7 May and authorised its transmission to the Council. The updated TBR report will be discussed by Member States at the TBR Committee on 29 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The updating investigation concludes that the findings of the first investigation as concerns the sectors of container ships and product and chemicals tankers were confirmed, namely that the Korean subsidies in question were causing adverse affects to the EU industry within the meaning of the WTO Subsidies Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards developments in 2001 in the LNG – natural gas carriers – sector, the updated TBR reports stresses the considerable increase in the Korean market shares and concludes that further examination is necessary to determine whether a consistent trend emerges over the longer term. The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal on the temporary defence mechanism on which the European Parliament was consulted in November 2001, is provisionally planned to be discussed again during the next Industry Council meeting which is scheduled for 6 June. The Commission holds that a joint double response is necessary, that is the WTO complaint and the temporary defence mechanism. Furthermore, the Commission welcomes the common position agreed by OECD members in Paris to launch fresh discussions on a new agreement on shipbuilding involving major non-OECD shipbuilding nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that these are important steps towards addressing the problems raised by the Korean practices, both in connection with the TBR case and temporary defence mechanism and, in the long-term, the OECD agreement. It therefore intends to actively participate in these discussions and carefully evaluate developments. There were also other detailed questions, I can transmit some replies in the form of our annual report and after having discussed with my colleagues who are working with this file, Mr Lamy and Mr Monti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only has there been no improvement since then, if anything the disparity has become even greater. International competition is still being grossly distorted by South Korea's price dumping, meaning a further loss of world market share for the European Union. There is a danger that these structural imbalances will become even more marked. For example, South Korea's shipyards are making enormous efforts to get orders for certain types of ship, such as cruise ships, which up to now have been Europe's domain. These continuing problems are putting a strain on a sector of European industry that has had to cope with a difficult adaptation process in recent years. That applies both to capacity reduction and to the need to step up quality and productivity in the remaining yards.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional impact of this structural change has been and continues to be at its most severe in the peripheral regions. If the very existence of Europe's shipbuilding industry is not to be jeopardised, the protection measures proposed by the Commission for the duration of the dispute resolution procedure are vital. That is why it is important for the Council to approve time-limited protection measures of this kind immediately. Furthermore, the procedures for levying anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be consistently applied in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, threats have had no discernible effect on South Korea's behaviour. It is now time for clear-cut action! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the same alliance every time, and that does not improve matters. There seems to be no doubt at all that the South Koreans are granting state subsidies which contravene WTO rules. However, there is considerable disagreement as to what should be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is solely responsible for initiating a WTO procedure against South Korea. In spite of unambiguous requests from the Council and the European Parliament, the Commission, together with Commissioner Lamy as the person responsible for this area, have, however, so far shown an impressive ability to ignore these requests. For quite incomprehensible reasons, Mr Lamy refuses to initiate a WTO procedure unless, at the same time, state subsidies for European shipyards are introduced; or, to put it another way, Mr Lamy will only try to have the South Korean practice deemed unlawful if Europe itself introduces an unlawful practice. As I see it, we in Europe would only damage our own case through such an approach. Hopefully, you, Mr Liikanen, can, however, explain the wisdom of this position, though I doubt it. As rapporteur last autumn, I did a lot of work to stop this link from being made, and I am still doing so. State subsidies have never been of benefit to anything at all and are expensive for the Member States. As, incidentally, I also did in a still unanswered letter I wrote together with my fellow MEP, Mrs Kauppi, from Finland, I would most strongly urge Commissioner Lamy to initiate a WTO procedure against South Korea straight away. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party makes the same proposal in Amendment No 3.</p>
<p class="contents">In Danish shipyards, employees have already begun to be fired on the grounds that it is no longer possible to compete with the huge state subsidies paid by the Koreans. This is therefore a very important matter, especially for the area in which I was elected, and I would urge that a WTO procedure be initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the issue of unemployment, I would refer to the ELDR Group’s Amendment No 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fisheries and shipbuilding, which are so closely linked, are matters of deep concern in many Member States, in regions of the European Union such as Galicia and in cities such as mine, Vigo, where shipbuilding and fishing are the source of employment and means of living for many families.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2000, a report from Parliament set out the threats to shipbuilding in Europe: crisis in the fisheries sector, flags of convenience in the merchant navy and the risks of ships registered in a Community country being built outside of Europe. This is all because we are incapable of standing up to a situation of unfair competition in the face of a reality of disloyalty and dumping,<span class="italic"> </span>while we wait for the Commission and the Council to adopt courageous and firm decisions of great political significance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the naval sector accepts and desires the European Union’s objectives: streamlining of the shipbuilding industry, an increase in productivity, an increase in the competitiveness of shipyards, improving the environment, which are objectives that can be achieved in a situation of transparency and equality, but not with the disadvantage of dumping and unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask for a link to be established between the temporary defence mechanism and the decisions adopted by the WTO on measures undertaken by the Community against Korea, and therefore we also ask for the protection mechanism to be extended to sectors of the market such as gas carriers, ferries and roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels, as the complaint made to the WTO also includes them, as well as container ships, oil and chemical tankers and natural gas tankers.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude: the Regulation should be adopted before it is too late and the shipyards have closed down because nothing can be done. What is worse is that if the European Union does not support shipbuilding through temporary investment, it may be giving an invitation to those who practise dumping and unfair competition to extend those practices to other sectors of the economy, such as the automotive industry and electronics. Both possibilities go against the transparency and freedom of competition that Europe and the European people want.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, let us not be too late. The migraine will disappear because we will have lost our heads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I confess that I am tired, but not too tired to fight for jobs in Europe's shipbuilding industry. Over the next few days the whole world – or at least its football fans – will be focussing on Japan and South Korea. However, in view of the shipbuilding situation I would rather avert my gaze from the Far East. The background remains the same – dumping prices in the Korean shipyards. The distortion in competition already described and recently confirmed in a Community report is becoming worse because of the ending of subsidies in Europe. As a consequence, more and more maritime companies are closing down and the many job losses associated with this mean only one thing: the European shipbuilding industry is fighting for its life!</p>
<p class="contents">What are we in Europe doing? That is what I am constantly asked as a Member for a coastal area. I feel like telling the people affected that Parliament has done its homework but that the other two key players are neglecting their responsibilities. Let me mention a few points to illustrate why I am so angry. We are now discussing our third resolution in this House and we gave our agreement to time-limited protection measures a long time ago. And yet support for our shipyards has still not been given the go-ahead. Why? Because the Council has still not reached agreement and the Commission unfortunately still has to take into consideration types of ship that are already covered by the WTO complaint. That is why I would like to clearly restate the key points of our common policy here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to take action at Community level. This needs to be taken immediately, in the form of a WTO complaint, and, as we have heard, the Council is meeting next week in any case. This Community action needs to go hand in hand with temporary support for Europe's shipyards. Failing that, we will find ourselves playing football without a full defence, at the risk of labouring the footballing analogy. The wheels of the complaint procedure turn very slowly, but meanwhile Europe's shipbuilding sector is dying. We should not underestimate the declaratory effect of a WTO complaint, but at the same time we need to have powerful and immediate measures in reserve. The resolution before you clearly calls for both these things, so that I expect the cross-party amendment to receive broad support in tomorrow's vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
