According to highly respected human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch, it is a well-established fact that of 75 political dissidents, independent journalists and human rights advocates who were summarily tried in April 2003, 60 remain imprisoned.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not presented orally at Council Question Time at Parliament’s May 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has condemned the extremely harsh punishments imposed in 2003 on 75 Cuban citizens. The EU has repeatedly made representations to the Cuban authorities about the unsatisfactory human rights situation in Cuba and demanded the release of all political prisoners. The Council regrets the fact that only a few prisoners have been released, and even then, in some cases, only on account of severe health problems. It also condemns the fact that, purely for exercising their right to freedom of speech and expression, other Cuban citizens have recently been sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment.</p>
<p>It is up to Cuba to put matters right, especially in view of its membership of the Human Rights Council and the resulting obligation to apply and advocate particularly high standards. On high-level visits human rights issues are invariably raised, including the fate of political prisoners.

<p>The German Presidency goes on to claim that EU policy on Cuba is independent of the USA.

<p>Scientific data concludes that, if used as the front-line primary test, HPV DNA testing is the next logical advance in best practice for cervical cancer prevention. It not only offers a higher level of sensitivity and increased disease detection rate, but also allows for less frequent screenings, ultimately saving time and resources within a health system. Despite the introduction of new vaccines, if countries do not offer more organised and better quality screening programmes using the most advanced technologies, Europeans will face an increase, not a decrease, in the incidence of cervical cancer. Since the adoption of the 2003 Recommendation on Cancer Screening, a new wealth of European data provides overwhelming evidence to favour HPV DNA testing over cytology (smears) as a better predictor for identifying women at risk for developing cervical cancer.</p>
<p>What steps will the Council take to ensure that in its considerations of the Commission’s upcoming review of the 2003 Recommendation on Cancer Screening it will adequately reflect current advances and developments and update the Recommendation to reflect newly published evidence and recent European clinical guidelines to ensure rapid advances towards eliminating this preventable disease across Europe?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This will lay down a European reference standard for cervical cancer screening; this is a measure to implement the Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in which it was suggested to the Member States that they should carry out screening programmes in accordance with European guidelines on best practice.</p>
<p>As soon as those guidelines are published, the Council Presidency will refer to them and decide on appropriate follow-up measures, taking account of the most recent advances and developments in this field, so that rapid progress can be made throughout the European Union with overcoming this preventable disease.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Comparison of the measures taken in relation to Sudan and Belarus is, in principle, possible and reasonable only to a limited degree, since the political circumstances of the two countries are completely different.</p>
<p>The EU imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994, and it is still applicable. The sanctions (restrictions on travel and the freezing of assets) specified in UN Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005) as being applicable to persons obstructing the peace process and/or committing offences against international law or human rights or committing other acts of cruelty in Darfur were incorporated into EU and EC law. In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006) of 1 June 2006, the Council decided to impose sanctions on four persons.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly stressed its willingness to take appropriate action – including targeted sanctions – against all the parties to the conflict in the event of failure to make visible progress in Darfur, and has furthermore expressed its support for the use of sanctions in accordance with Resolution 1591 against anyone obstructing the peace process, committing violations of human rights or breaching the agreed cease-fire or the arms embargo, while applying the measures described in the Resolution to their fullest extent.</p>
<p>The Council has argued that the Security Council should, as a matter of urgency, examine the possibility of further measures of the kind provided for in its own Resolution 1591 of 2005, and is itself willing to consider additional measures, in particular under UN aegis, against any party obstructing the implementation of the UN’s package of measures in support of the Mission of the African Union in Sudan (AMIS).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0304"></a>

<p>It is not open to the Council to express views on public statements of this kind. Although it is following closely developments in the area to which the honourable Member refers, no official statement has yet been made.</p>
<p>It needs nevertheless to be pointed out that Turkey, as a country applying for accession to the EU, and engaged in negotiations to that end, is required to endorse the values and objectives of the European Union, as set out in the Treaties. Turkey is therefore required to demonstrate beyond all doubt its commitment to good neighbourly relationships and to the resolution of outstanding border disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter.</p>
<p>This, together with the principles in accordance with which negotiations are to be conducted, is stipulated in the negotiating framework for the accession negotiations with Turkey, and the peaceful settlement of border disputes is also listed as a short-term priority in the accession partnership with Turkey adopted by the Council on 23 January 2006.

<p>Following an interruption of many months, peace talks between the Government of Uganda and the ‘Lord’s Resistance Army’ (LRA) rebel movement were resumed on 26 April 2007 in Juba (Southern Sudan). Both sides agreed to extend the ceasefire until 30 June 2007, and so it is that no further acts of violence on the part of the LRA in Northern Uganda have been confirmed since August 2006. An agreement on comprehensive solutions to the conflict in Northern Uganda was signed on 2 May 2007. This agreement, however, addresses only the second point of negotiation on the two parties’ common agenda.</p>
<p>Since talks on how to resolve Northern Uganda’s political problems are continuing, there are encouraging prospects of an end being brought to the conflict that has been going on for 20 years now, and internal refugees are now beginning to return to the areas from which they originate, in which process they are being supported by humanitarian measures put in place by the EU and by many individual states. The International Criminal Court’s warrants for the arrest of the rebel leader Joseph Kony and a number of his commanders on charges of grave violations of human rights remain in force.</p>
<p>Several ambassadors of EU Member States participated in the latest talks in Juba as observers and had additional talks with Joachim Chissano, the UN envoy for the conflict in Northern Uganda, in order to stress the EU’s great interest in a resolution of these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0329"></a>

<p>The promotion and protection of the rights of the child are a priority concern in EU human rights policy. By adopting the EU guidelines on children and armed conflict in December 2003 the European Union has signalled its aim of focusing more closely on measures in this area. The guidelines make it incumbent upon the European Union to take account of the short-, medium- and long-term effects of armed conflict on children through monitoring and reporting by heads of missions, military commanders and EU special representatives, as well as through representations, political dialogue, multilateral cooperation and crisis management operations.</p>
<p>The European Union has expressed its concern about children affected by armed conflict in a number of different forums and has referred to this problem in several declarations. The EU Troika has made representations in a number of States, including Burundi, Uganda, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia.</p>
<p>The Council has tabled a strategy for implementing the guidelines (Doc. 8285/1/06 REV 1) which is based on UN Security Council Resolution 1612. The EU special representatives have received specific instructions on this issue, and in June 2006 a checklist for the integration of the protection of children into ESDP operations was published (Doc. 9767/06).</p>
<p>The European Union provides sustained support for the work of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict; she recently approached the Political and Security Committee and the Council Working Party on Human Rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0334"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has already stated, the Commission proposal for a Regulation on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community is currently before Parliament and the Council for their examination. In its current version, the future Regulation’s provisions on charging structures cover only roaming services for voice calls, and there are two principal reasons for this, which are as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Commission had taken this initiative not only because charges for roaming services were unacceptably high for both end customers and wholesale customers, but also because this problem is not susceptible to effective solution by the national regulatory authorities at the level of the individual Member States. Although the occurrence of unjustifiably high prices in the field of data communication services, for example in short message services (SMS) and multimedia message services (MMS), was noted in the course of the consultations carried out by the Commission, the national regulatory authorities have not as yet been able to observe such problems when conducting their own investigations into SMS services. Secondly, it is, at the present moment, difficult to see what shape development in the MMS field, in other similar data communication services and in the sphere of internet access is likely to take, and there is very definitely a considerable danger that the development of this market might be hindered by the application of inappropriate regulations. It would be helpful in this respect if the Commission were to draft an assessment of the economic and legal impact of such regulation.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, both the co-legislators wish to give the Commission a mandate to join with the national regulatory authorities in monitoring the market for roaming services in the field of data communication, including SMS and MMS. It is planned that the Commission should, in its report on the application of the future regulation, also discuss the development of charges for the provision of speech and data communication services, including the forwarding of SMS and MMS, to roaming customers, whether they be end customers or wholesale customers, and that it should, where necessary, make recommendations as to what regulatory measures are needed in this area.</p>
<p>Members of Parliament will also be aware that Parliament and the Council, in the interests of more transparent pricing, want to require service providers to provide their customers, free of charge and on demand, with details of the charges per unit for the sending and receiving of SMS, MMS and other data communication services when roaming within the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0336"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council wishes to thank the honourable Member for her question.</p>
<p>Since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the EU has bordered on the Black Sea region, which includes the Eastern European Neighbourhood Policy countries of Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and whose ‘frozen conflicts’ have considerable potential for bringing about political crises. The region does, however, also have considerable – and as yet unexploited – potential for economic cooperation and growth, and so it is very much in the EU’s interests that its development should move forward.</p>
<p>There are, then, many arguments in favour of the EU having a more active policy in respect of the Black Sea Region, in which, although it is already involved in it, it can today assume an even more prominent role than it has done in the past by promoting cooperation in the region. The EU has therefore embarked on the drafting of a coherent and comprehensive policy in respect of the Black Sea Region aimed at strengthening regional cooperation and developing the region’s relations with the EU at every level.</p>
<p>The Presidency is also able to inform the honourable Member that the Council, on 14 May, adopted the following Conclusions on the Black Sea synergy initiative:</p>
<p>‘The Council welcomed the Commission's Communication “Black Sea Synergy – A new Regional Cooperation Initiative”. The Council underlined that following the accession of two Black Sea littoral states, Bulgaria and Romania, the EU’s interest in furthering stability and prosperity in the Black Sea area has become even greater.</p>
<p>The Council looked forward to further examining the Communication and invited the future Presidencies and the European Commission to continue work on an enhanced and coherent EU engagement in and with the Black Sea area, particularly in the framework of a strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy and building on synergies with regional bodies and initiatives. The aim should be to intensify the regional cooperation in sectors of cross-border relevance such as energy, the environment, transport, telecommunications, science and technology, freedom, justice and security, as well as democracy, human rights promotion, respect for international law and civil society cooperation.</p>
<p>Given the strategic importance of the Black Sea area to the EU, the Council invites the Commission to carry out a review during the first half of 2008 of the development of the Black Sea Synergy Initiative, as a basis for further consideration by the Council of its engagement towards the region as a whole.’</p>
<p>Long-term successful development in the Black Sea Region will be possible only as and when the conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh – currently regarded as ‘frozen’ – have been resolved and normal and cooperative relationships have been established between all countries in the region.</p>
<p>The presidency takes the view that the closer regional cooperation envisaged in the Black Sea Synergy Initiative will not only bring economic benefits but will also be able to help build political trust and thereby create an environment in which the resolution of difficult political issues is made easier.</p>
<p>The Council has given its attention to the issue of the unresolved conflicts and has appointed EU special envoys for Moldova and the South Caucasus; it has also established both the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EU BAM), the head of which is also a high-level political advisor to the EU special envoy for Moldova, and the Border Protection Support Team in Georgia. These instruments need to be in continually active and flexible use if the EU is to make a substantial contribution to the region’s stability, and the EU BAM’s mandate has just been renewed for another two years up to the end of November 2009.</p>
<p>The three ENP action plans for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were adopted on 14 November 2006, and each of them include among their main priorities the settlement of the internal conflicts in Georgia and the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p>
<p>The EU-Moldova action plan, adopted in February 2005, lists as a priority the peaceful resolution of the Transnistria conflict.</p>
<p>In 2007, the European Union’s special envoy to the South Caucasus will be continuing to endeavour to create the conditions for the settlement of conflicts in the region, in which his first step will be to establish channels of communication between the parties to the conflicts and to take action to foster trust between them and him. In settling the conflicts, he will, in accordance with his mandate, liaise closely with the existing machinery for the resolution of conflicts. Two of the joint chairmen of the Minsk Group, Ambassador Bernard Fassier and Mr Matthew Brysa, reported to the Council in April on the current state of negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>In the course of 2007, the EU special envoy for Moldova will also be working on a solution to the Transnistria conflict, representing the EU in conflict resolution talks and actively engaging in bilateral consultations with Moldova and other partners including Russia.</p>
<p>2007 will also see the Council endeavouring to bring about settlement of the ‘frozen conflicts’, and it is prepared to play its part in implementing any solution to them. It has held an internal discussion on the results of the special envoy’s and experts’ mission sent by the Commission to Georgia and the breakaway regions in January 2007 and will now embark on putting into effect the measures agreed on.</p>
<p>The Council is also ready and willing to help with Nagorno-Karabakh, although precisely what form the EU’s contribution will take will be determined only as and when the political parameters for the resolution of the conflict are known.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0337"></a>

<p>On 1 May, demonstrators were arrested en masse and dozens of others injured in a barbaric attack by Turkish riot police in Istanbul.

The demonstration, which had been organised by the Turkish Communist Party, the Patriotic Front, the Labour Party EMEP, the trade union movement DISK and other left-wing parties and trade unions, was dedicated to the memory of the 34 demonstrators who were killed on May Day 1977 when special police forces dispatched from Ankara tried to break up the demonstration by pouring in chemicals, tear gas, water cannon, armoured vehicles and helicopters, etc.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The presidency is following developments in Turkey with close attention.</p>
<p>In a more general context, however, it should be borne in mind that the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005 states, in its ‘outlines for the negotiations’, that negotiations are opened with Turkey on the presupposition that Turkey will comply sufficiently with the political criteria laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993 and later largely incorporated into Article 6 (1) of the Treaty on European Union and promulgated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>It is quite clear from this that what the EU expects of Turkey is that it should press on with its process of reform and work to bring about further improvements in the fundamental areas of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and basic freedoms, including the relevant European case law, and that it should consolidate and extend its legislation and implementing measures with especial attention to a zero-tolerance policy in combating torture and mistreatment and the application of provisions relating to the free expression of opinion, freedom of religion, the rights of women, ILO standards – including the rights of trade unions – and the rights of minorities. The Council, furthermore, in its conclusions on 11 December 2006, noted that further considerable efforts would be needed in order to extend, inter alia, free expression of opinion and the rights of trades unions. All these issues are regularly raised in the course of political dialogue with Turkey.</p>
<p>The presidency will continue to monitor developments in Turkey and will address all issues arising in an appropriate manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0313"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is strongly committed to preventing incidents in which sporting passions turn into disturbances and violent conduct. Our aim is that football matches with a European dimension should not just be regarded as a potential source of ructions relating to breaches of law and public order and security. It is not acceptable that groups of determined hooligans have tarnished the image of the majority of peaceful football fans.</p>
<p>Based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the EU should collect national experiences, generate synergies and develop further data exchange among national services. For the Commission, European added value can be achieved through:</p>
<p>Developing legislative instruments where necessary</p>
<p>Enhancing practical exchanges of experience and best practice between Member States, including law enforcement authorities, in order to establish common standards of safety and public order</p>
<p>Reinforcing operational cooperation at EU-level, particularly information exchanges on disorder assessments and on football supporters, their movements between countries and their classification as peaceful or violent supporters; developing further the National Football Information Points</p>
<p>Supporting the coordination and development of these and other activities through financial programmes.</p>
<p>To meet these objectives, the Commission intends to:</p>
<p>Develop a multidisciplinary approach based on prevention and law enforcement, including socio-educative activities for supporters and cooperation with international and national football bodies, supported by EC funding</p>
<p>Look into the possibility of developing further binding regulations or recommended standards</p>
<p>Support the development of existing CEPOL training courses on public order/crowd management and crowd control/hooliganism</p>
<p>Promote the use and dissemination of best practices including the Handbook on police cooperation in major football matches</p>
<p>In this perspective, the Commission with the Council Presidency and UEFA<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will organise, at the end of 2007, a large EU high level conference with all stakeholders to consider the development of a European policy to prevent sport violence.</p>
<p>As regards the use by Member States of banning from stadiums all the individuals previously guilty of violent conduct at football matches, the Council already adopted a resolution on 17 November 2003. The Member States are invited to examine the possibility of introducing relevant provisions in their legal system and take appropriate steps ensuring their recognition in another Member States, hosting football matches. Following this Resolution, only few Member States adopted criminal or administrative provisions allowing banning orders. It can also be recalled that the Council has recently adopted, on the 4<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2006, a Resolution concerning an updated handbook with recommendations for international police cooperation and measures to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with football matches with an international dimension, in which at least one Member State is involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The transfer of personal data to which the Honourable Member refers is made to an entity in the United States (US) which has adhered to the Safe Harbour scheme.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Directive contains specific provisions with respect to the transfers of personal data to third countries. The Directive provides that an international transfer of personal data may lawfully take place when the third country in question ensures an appropriate level of protection. With regard to transfers of personal data to the US, the Commission declared in 2000 that transfers to the US organizations having joined the Safe Harbour offer an adequate level of protection in accordance with the Data Protection Directive (Decision of 26 July 2000).</p>
<p>The Safe Harbour is a specifc scheme put in place by the US in order to facilitate transfers of EU personal data to US entities and meets the requirement of the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to ensure an adequate level of protection level for a transfer to a third country. Safe Harbour sets out privacy principles (i.e., access, notice, choice, onward transfer, enforcement, security and data integrity) that US organisations wishing to join this scheme must commit to observe and publicy disclose before they are certified by the US Department of Commerce. The US Federal Trade Commission is the main body of the US Government competent to enforce compliance with Safe Harbour privacy principles by Safe Harbour organisations.</p>
<p>Transfers of personal data to a US organisation in the field of employment and human resources are covered by Safe Harbour. In this case, Safe Harbour contains specific provisions aimed at ensuring the protection of personal data of employees of EU entities, as well as their sensitive data. Any US Safe Harbour member which receives personal data must commit to cooperate and comply with the advice of competent EU data protection authorities. A panel of EU data protection authorities has been set up by Safe Habour. It is the competent body to examine and resolve complaints lodged by individuals for alleged infringement of Safe Harbour principles. If the entity in question fails to comply with the advice of the EU data protection authorities panel, the latter will inform the US Federal Trade Commission to take enforcement action over the entity or to inform the Department of Commerce so that it can be removed from the register of Safe Harbour members.</p>
<p>The US entity receiving personal data from the EU is included in the the official register of entities members of Safe Harbour held by the US Department of Commerce. The inclusion in this register indicates that the US Department of Commerce has certified that this entity has taken the necessary measures to comply with the privacy principles required to join the Safe Harbour with a view to accepting transfers of personal data from the EU.</p>
<p>An EU entity that transfers personal data to a US entity that adheres to the Safe Harbour scheme is not in breach of the EU Data Protection Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission informs the Honourable Member that data subjects may in any case address their complaint to their EU national data protection authority which shall examine whether the EU entity complies with national data protection law as regards its processing activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0345"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not collect specific information regarding living conditions for prisoners, including pre-trial detainees in the European Union - such as statistics regarding cell space, the ratio of prison wards to inmates etc – since this falls under the responsibility and competence of the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has, however, gathered some statistical data on detention in the Member States in connection with the drafting of the Proposal on the European supervision order (for instance, statistical data on the prison population, including pre-trial detention that the Commission drew up in 2003 at the request of the Italian Presidency, show that there are considerable differences between the EU Member States both as regards the rate of pre-trial detention per 100 000 inhabitants and the proportion of own nationals in relation to foreign detainees )<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It should be pointed out that the Commission is aware of the fact that when action in the field of prison policy is considered, the possible impact must be analysed in the light of available statistics. On 7 August 2006 the Commission presented a Communication<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> developing a strategy to measure crime and criminal justice – an EU Action Plan 2006 – 2010, which also aims at including background information on nationality and residency for prison populations, which is urgently needed for EU policy on criminal justice.</p>
<p>A recent study on prison overcrowding in 24 European countries demonstrates that overcrowding exists in 50% of these countries. Overcrowding seriously undermines reintegration of prisoners into society. The Commission, in cooperation with Member States, has thus proposed a series of measures to reduce the number of prisoners, including pre-trial detainees.</p>
<p>First of all, on 29 August 2006 the Commission adopted a "Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the European supervision order in pre-trial procedures between Member States of the European Union"<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This draft Framework Decision, once adopted, would allow judicial authorities in the different Member States to release persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence but who are not resident in the Member State in which they are suspected from custody and transpose it into a non-custodial pre-trial supervision measures, which could be transferred across the borders into the Member State where this person is normally resident. As many as 8,000 persons could be affected by this measure, which corresponds to the total pre-trial detention population of the United Kingdom some years ago.</p>
<p>Moreover, in February 2007 Germany and France took an initiative with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences and alternative sanctions. This Framework Decision, once adopted, would facilitate social reintegration of sentenced persons, who will be allowed to return to their home State. Moreover, it would diminish the risk of recidivism thereby reinforcing public security and the security of victims. And last but not least, it would reduce prison overcrowding.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme<a href="#defann_21_5" name="refann_21_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> provides that an "analysis of minimum standards in pre-trial detention procedures and the routines for regular review of the grounds for detention" should be undertaken before the end of 2007.<a href="#defann_21_6" name="refann_21_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> A study will be launched soon to examine this question and should be completed in 2008.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to facilitate the re-settlement of (ex)-offenders, and reduce recidivism, more than 100 projects under the 2000-2006 EQUAL Community Initiative have tested new approaches to preventing re-offending through re-settlement support, aftercare or assisting inmates while in prison. Some of these innovations are structural and relate to the management of change in prisons, the introduction of quality systems and the motivation of staff to adopt a more creative, pro-active attitude to the rehabilitation of inmates. Others are concerned with the development of new forms of education and training. Many of these initiatives involve the opening up of prisons to agencies and individuals, including employers, so that offenders are empowered and prepared to play a more positive part in society on their release.</p>
<p>A European Mainstreaming Programme is currently being implemented with the objective to convince key actors who are responsible for penal and/or resettlement policies, to adopt the good practices that are emerging from the EQUAL projects.</p>
<p>The three main foci of this Programme are:</p>
<p>- An Exchange Event of EQUAL DPs held in Portugal, during October 2006, that agreed on a set of topics to be presented at the subsequent Policy Forum;</p>
<p>- A Policy Forum in Poland, in June 2007, to confront policy makers with the good practices that are emerging from EQUAL and to engage their interest in taking some of these forward;</p>
<p>- A Transnational Network, later in 2007, to ensure the continued transfer and the sustainability of relevant EQUAL outcomes, and of relevant outcomes from the new programming period for the Structural Funds, provided there is sufficient interest in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council and Parliament are currently finalising an opinion on the Commission proposal on reducing charges for making mobile phone calls from and to abroad in the EU, and making them more transparent. Following a proposal by Parliament, data communication (SMS and MMS messages) is also likely to be included in the measures.</p>
<p>Research carried out by the Netherlands Consumer Association shows that charges for mobile Internet use (via mobile phones or laptop or handheld computers) are also not transparent and, like current roaming charges, can be excessively high for accessing the Internet abroad in the EU.</p>
<p>With the continual development of this technology, mobile Internet use can only increase. Use of the Internet, like international mobile phone use, is important within the context of the EU's economic and social development model.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the view that the rapid deployment of competitively priced mobile internet services is important for EU social and economic growth.</p>

<p>From the discussions which are currently ongoing between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, it seems clear that monitoring of developments for data roaming prices will be an important element of the final regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, the final regulation is likely to include provisions aimed at enhancing the transparency of data roaming prices for consumers. The Commission is supportive of this approach and intends to monitor this market very closely and will report developments to Council and Parliament.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has had the opportunity to express itself on the subject on several occasions in plenary session. It wants to emphasise again that the Commission, the Member States and the Parliament share the view that there is a real threat to civil aviation from home-made liquid explosives.</p>
<p>As regards the question of Mr Guardans Cambo, the regulation on restrictions on liquids does indeed have an unpublished annex which is classified as "EU Restricted" and thus not published in the Official Journal as required by article 8/1 of the Framework Regulation 2320 adopted by the Parliament and the Council in 2002. The Regulation is addressed not directly to citizens, but rather to the appropriate authority of each Member State.</p>
<p>However, passengers should be informed about items that are prohibited. Information is displayed in Community airports telling passengers about the rules on liquids, as well on airline websites, it is fair to say that Community airports and airlines appear to be meeting their obligations to inform the public and that the necessary information is in the public domain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the main stakeholder organisations representing airports, airlines and airport shops all confirmed that they had been involved by the Commission during the development of Regulation 1546/2006. The measures contained in this regulation were approved by the Member States and the Parliament following the correct procedures. They have not been adopted in secrecy and the possibility of juridical review exists like in every other case.</p>
<p>Turning to the question of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, the Commission sympathises with the issues she raises. It is unpleasant for any passenger to have any item – no matter its value – confiscated. The provision of free drinking water is, indeed, desirable and concerns about the environmental effect of plastic bags are laudible.</p>
<p>It is the normal practise of airlines, on long-haul flights at least, to make non-alcoholic refreshments freely available to passengers in order to avoid deshydratation. Community legislation does not regulate prices at airport shops. Nonetheless, the Commission is looking at this issue very carefully and is encouraging airports and airlines to take all appropriate measures in order to ensure that free drinking water is available cheap, free or market-priced and that passergers are informed of any available sources of free drinking water.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission can assure the Parliament that the respect of passenger rights is a cornerstone of our legislation in the field of aviation security. But it should also be noted that one basic right is the right to travel safely, as much as possible free from the threat of terrorist attack.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

For almost five years, since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> there has existed common rules in the field of civil aviation security. Futhermore, under the Regulation the Commission undertakes inspections of Community airports in order to ensure a correct and even application of the common rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p>Any differences in levels of security that apply today are as a result of Member States choosing to apply more stringent measures. These can result in passengers whose journey started within the Community being subject to rescreening when transferring flights at another Community airport, even though the legislation does not require this. However, it should be noted that all transfer passengers at Community airports who arrived on flights from outside the European Economic Area shall be subject to rescreening, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 2320/2002.</p>
<p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established by Regulation No 1592/2002<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which entered into force in September 2002, with the aim of promoting a uniform and high standard of safety and environmental protection in the field of civil aviation and does not play a direct role in security issues. The Agency provides the Commission with all the technical expertise the latter requires and assists it, among other things, in carrying out its legislative and regulatory tasks. It also implements a system for monitoring the application of Community legislation, evaluating its effects and making any useful suggestions on the matter. In this context, EASA plays a part in implementing Regulation 2111/2005 by passing on to the Commission information that is of relevance when it comes to updating the Community list of airlines subject to a ban on use and by helping to distribute this list to the public.</p>
<p>In November 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation aimed at extending its powers to air operations and to pilots’ licences. The Commission is confident that this proposal will be adopted by Parliament and by the Council over the next few months. Furthermore, in an effort to promote a fully integrated approach to aviation safety in Europe, the Commission is already making preparations for EASA’s missions to be extended to the areas of airport operations safety and air traffic.</p>
<p>There are no plans at this stage to extend EASA’s powers beyond aviation safety to security, that is to say, to the prevention of illegal acts in the field of aviation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In 2006, the Group continued playing a central role in driving policy initiatives of the Commission for the active promotion of fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, with due regard for the Community competences and the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>In particular in 2006, the Group contributed to the finalisation of the Communication on the rights of the child and the Green Paper on diplomatic and consular protection before their adoption by the Commission; contributed to on-going work in view of the European year for equal opportunities for all 2007, and raised inter-cultural dialogue – including issues related to different beliefs – in the context of the preparation of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008. The Group considered the creation of the European day against the death penalty and launched the preparations towards a European day against trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>The Group raised a number of recurrent issues, such as the state of play of institutional negotiations in view of the creation of the Agency on Fundamental Rights and the European Institute for Gender Equality, and of dialogue with the Council of Europe on the accession by the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. The implementation of the methodology for monitoring fundamental rights compliance in EC legislative proposals was also highly considered.</p>
<p>The Group monitored the implementation of the non-discrimination directives and took stock of the negotiations at United Nations level in view of an International Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Disabled People. Minorities, racism and xenophobia were on the Group’s agenda too.</p>
<p>The Group held an extraordinary session on the occasion of the International Women’s Day – 8 March 2006. This meeting involved members of the Parliament and was devoted to the presentation and discussion of the main aspects of the Road Map for equality between women and men 2006-2010, which was prepared by the Group and adopted by the Commission on 1 March 2006. In addition, the Group considered gender-related issues, such as the objectives for the recruitment and appointment of women to management posts and other A*/AD posts within the Commission in 2006 or the role of women in science and technology.</p>
<p>As regards the alleged CIA use of European Countries to transport and hold prisoners, the Group has closely followed the work done by the Parliament and the Council of Europe and supported the Commission’s line on this important and sensitive issue. However, the Group held no meetings after Parliament’s adoption, in February 2007, of the resolution on the temporary committee’s final report. In this text the Commission stressed very forcefully that it was essential to fight effectively against terrorism using all the legal instruments available, and that any anti-terrorist measure must at all costs respect fundamental rights and international humanitarian law. The Commission, within the framework of its powers, supported the work of the temporary committee. Like the Parliament, the Commission takes the view that it is essential that the Member States concerned carry out inquiries, and welcomes the fact that judicial or parliamentary inquiries are under way in some countries. The Commission will give careful consideration to calls for action that fall within its remit; to this end, it will carry out a comprehensive evaluation in the light of the results of the various national inquiries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0292"></a>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is aware, a Commission investigation was initiated in July 2006 to assess whether maintaining anti dumping measures on imports of CFL(i) lamps, originating in the People's Republic of China, would be justified for a further period of five years. The case is still under scrutiny by the Commission and no conclusion as to the final outcome of the case can be drawn at this point in time.</p>
<p>The aim of this investigation is to verify whether unfair competitive distortions which favoured exports originating in China still exist, or, whether they risk reoccurring in the future if anti-dumping measures are removed. In this respect it should be borne in mind that the purpose of anti-dumping measures is neither to prohibit imports nor to hamper supplies to the Community market, but rather to re-establish conditions of fair competition on the Community market.</p>
<p>More generally and without prejudging the final outcome of the case, available statistics show that imports of CFL(i) lamps, originating China, have more than trebled in the period 2001 – 2006. During the same time, consumption in the Community has more than doubled and the Chinese market share is therefore higher than before measures were imposed.</p>
<p>It follows from the import statistics that the measures in place have not restricted trade flows of CFL(i) lamps, but rather they have ensured that they are now traded at prices which should eliminate the injurious effect of the dumping previously found.</p>
<p>It would however be difficult to provide any useful estimation as to how this market will develop in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0295"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that the most important outcome of the Extraordinary Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit held in Dar-es-Salaam on 28-29 March 2007 is that for the first time the regional leaders decided to engage in the resolution of the Zimbabwe crisis through the appointment of South African President Mbeki, as a mediator in this process.</p>
<p>The Commission has fully supported the recently issued Council Conclusions welcoming the mandate given to President Mbeki to facilitate a dialogue between the opposition and the Government, and the engagement of President Kikwete as chair of the SADC organ, and standing ready to support the SADC initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that, at this stage, the SADC initiative is the best option available to overcome the Zimbabwe crisis.</p>
<p>This SADC initiative has also been welcomed by some Resolutions adopted this month at the European Parliament Plenary session.</p>
<p>Concerning the information on the deployment of 2 500 Angolan paramilitaries in Zimbabwe, the Commission is aware that there have indeed been reports in the press about it but so far there has been no confirmation or even indication that this has occurred or is intended by the Angolan Government. Indeed, the Angolan Embassy in Harare in a statement of 21 March officially rejected these reports as "completely false" and informed that the purpose of the recent visit to Harare of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Angola was to sign Agreements of Interest of both countries such as sharing of knowledge and experience and never the reinforcement of Police power of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The Commission does not consider that the SADC Statement of 29 March in any way constitutes violation of the articles of the Cotonou Agreement referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the problem of large sea-going ships producing a lot of air pollution in ports. This is true not only for cruise ships and passenger boats, but also for cargo ships like tankers and container ships. It is for this reason that the European Commission looks for solutions covering both passenger and cargo ships.</p>
<p>The Commission has published a recommendation on shore side electricity<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the solution suggested in the Honourable Member's question. It recommends Member States to consider the installation of shore-side electricity for use by ships at berth in ports; particularly in ports where air quality limit values are exceeded or where there is public concern about high levels of noise nuisance, especially in berths situated near residential areas. It also asks Member States to consider financial incentives to promote these installations and to take steps towards the harmonisation of shore side electricity facilities. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is primarily the Member State or the local authority that should decide in individual cases if this option is effective, taking into account the local air quality situation. This situation differs from port to port. European legislation obliging such facilities is therefore not considered appropriate.</p>
<p>A measure already taken is Directive 2005/33/EC of the Parliament and the Council of 6 July 2005, amending Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This Directive requires the use of fuel with less than 0.1% sulphur for ships at berth as of 2010 and will contribute to reduction of air pollution in ports as of 2010.</p>
<p>At international level (the International Maritime Organization, IMO) the negotiations on reducing air pollution from seagoing ships, including cruise ships and passenger vessels, are now at a decisive stage. The aim is to reduce the air pollution at source, by improved engine technology, emission abatement and/or improved fuel quality. The Commission is pushing for an ambitious reduction of air pollution from ships. Should this not be possible, or not be possible within an acceptable time frame, the Commission will consider coming forward with a proposal for tighter standards in line with the provisions of the Thematic Strategies to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships of 21 November 2002<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and on air pollution of 21 September 2005<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the subsequent conclusions to these strategies by Council and Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the Commission proposal for the reform of the fruit and vegetables regime, adopted on 24 January 2007, there is a specific group of measures aimed at increasing the concentration of supply through producer organisations (POs) and producer groups (PGs) in the Member States which joined the Community as from 1 May 2004. Among these specific measures a national financial assistance, equal to a maximum of half the financial contribution of producers, could be authorised, under certain conditions, in those regions of the European Union where the degree of organisation of producers is particularly low. This assistance shall be additional to the operational fund.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is aware, in accordance with domestic Polish tax policy, only primary agricultural activity is exempted from income taxes i.e. Personal Income Tax (PIT) and Corporate Income Tax (CIT). Activities normally carried out by POs or PGs i.e. preparation of products (cleaning, drying, trimming, cutting, packaging) are not regarded as primary agricultural activity and, as a consequence, are liable to income taxes, even in the instance when they are done by individual farmers.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the benefits stemming from Community and national support under the current Regulations may clearly outweigh the costs of compulsory taxation in Poland, although as mentioned in the second paragraph, the Commission is not convinced that there are any additional costs coming from the fact that the producer is member of a PO. Therefore, the Polish tax policy can not be considered as potentially discouraging farmers from organising.</p>
<p>The national assistance proposed by the Commission involves a transfer of national budgetary resources and it is additional to the operational fund. It is not the intention of the Commission to grant to the Member States other possibilities to hand out this assistance as this would complicate the system. If the national assistance were to be channelled in other ways than financial transfer it would be difficult to safeguard that it is additional to the operational funds and equal to maximum half the financial contributions of producers to this fund.</p>
<p>In any case, the proposal is still under discussion at the Parliament and the Council. After the adoption of the Council proposal, the corresponding implementing rules will be drafted. Implementing rules on the proportion and details of the national additional assistance will then be studied and the Commission will take into consideration all the proposals from Member States including this one.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to add that the area of direct taxation is harmonised only to a very limited extent within the European Union. Therefore, the Member States are free to determine their own tax legislation, as long as it remains within the framework of the provisions of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission would be grateful if the Honourable Member can provide it with additional information and evidence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0308"></a>

<p>(EN) Structural change is an inherent part of the development of regional economies, and is experienced in many fields of activity including transport. The European Union, through its Cohesion Policy, helps the regions to design and implement policies to help regional authorities, businesses and workers to anticipate these changes, adapt more quickly to them and to exploit fully new opportunities. These policies result from strategies based on the strengths and weaknesses of each region, and are defined with the involvement of all local partners and all relevant expertise.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently finalising negotiations with the United Kingdom on its strategy for cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013, the National Strategic Reference Framework. While this strategy does not make specific reference to the transport sector, it is based on the need to promote the sustainable competitiveness of the regions, and their ability to adjust to and to exploit structural change. The strategy for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the Regional competitiveness and employment regions is based on four priorities: 1) Promoting innovation and knowledge transfer, 2) Stimulating enterprise and supporting successful business, 3) Ensuring sustainable development production and consumption and 4) Building sustainable communities The strategy for the European Social Fund (ESF) is based on two priorities: 1) Tackling barriers to employment and 2) Improving the skills of the local workforce.</p>
<p>In the specific case of the South East of England, the Commission expects to receive the relevant Regional competitiveness and employment ERDF Operational Programme in late June/ early July, so at this stage cannot comment on the priorities it will identify. Given the amount of money available for this programme, (€ 48 million total cost with an ERDF contribution of € 24 million) it is not expected that it will contain specific actions in support of the transport sector. It is expected, however, that it will concentrate on the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship which are both essential for sustainable economic development in the South East. The Ashford area will be eligible under this programmes and will therefore have direct accesss to cohesion policy support. The implementation of the programme, once adopted by the Commission, will be the responsibility of the Regional Development Agency (RDA) for the South East.</p>
<p>For the ESF allocation there is one Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment Operational Programme covering the whole of England. Each region has been given an ESF allocation within the total amount of the programme (2 893 million total for Regional competitiveness and employment of which 229 million is destined for the South East). The ESF Operational Programme has already been submitted to the Commission and contains two Priorities: 1) Extending employment opportunities and 2) Developing a skilled and adaptable workforce. The interventions will concentrate on tackling unemployment and inactivity by helping people with no or low level skills.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0311"></a>

<p>On 11 and 12 April a meeting of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee took place in Moscow.

He stressed that this was a hypothetical issue for the time being, as the Russian Government had not yet adopted a position on membership. However, in order to enable a debate on this issue to begin in Russia, it needed to be made clear whether Russia could expect some time - in several decades' time or later - to become a member of the EU, if it decided to apply and fulfilled all of the criteria for EU membership.</p>

<p>(EN) The Russian Federation is a strategic partner for the European Union. Russia is the largest neighbour of the EU, brought even closer by the Union’s 2004 and 2007 enlargements.

None of the important foreign policy issues in Europe can be settled unless we find a common understanding. We will continue to depend on each other for many years to come.</p>
<p>A key priority of the European Union is to build a strong strategic partnership with Russia based on a solid foundation of mutual respect.</p>

The NCP network also extends to other third countries in all continents, and includes so far 33 additional countries. The NCP system is open for all potential participants in the FP and the Commission is financially supporting transnational activities as well as organizing training events for the NCPs.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that such a decentralized one is more efficient than a centralized system which would be more difficult for e.g. SMEs to access. The NCPs are able to give advice and help on a number of issues such as how to apply for grants or in finding partners. Further, the NCP systems in the different countries show a wide variety reflecting the different national and regional research and innovation structures.</p>
<p>An Enquiry Service, provided by the Europe Direct Contact Centre, is in place and questions can be put on any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research FPs in particular by applying a web request (http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?pg=enquiries</p>
<p>) form. Every enquiry is logged in a database to ensure that a response is given as quickly as possible and then passed through to the relevant department for expert handling.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission has issued a call under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) in order to set up a "Services in support for business and innovation".</p>
<p>The aim of this call is to implement a single network providing integrated services in support of business and innovation in Europe, building on the strengths and achievements of the current Euro Info Centres and the Innovation Relay Centres. Under this call, the new network will implement the requirements of Article 21.2(c) of the CIP decision by providing complementary services, especially at regional level, to those services provided by the NCPs, to support the participation of SMEs in FP7. The CIP single network will have around 600 outlets and involve 2,000 to 2,500 staff across the EU. It will start to operate in January 2008 and will provide services to enterprises, notably SMEs.</p>

<p>Despite the ban imposed by the Commission on the hunting of birds during the migration season for many species of bird from and to Africa, and despite major protests from animal welfare organisations, the government of Malta has this year again, at the start of spring, authorised the hunting and shooting of a number of protected bird species. This is in flagrant contravention of the Birds Directive, which is designed, in particular, to protect a number of rare bird species. In 2004 the Commission already instituted proceedings against Malta before the Court of Justice, apparently to no avail.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's response? Will it be applying further sanctions vis-à-vis this serious and repeated violation of European legislation by a Member State?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (hereafter the Birds Directive), the hunting of migratory birds listed in Annex II of the Directive is not allowed during the return to their breeding grounds. Article 9 of the Birds Directive provides the possibility for Member States to apply a derogation but only under exceptional circumstances and only if the strict criteria set out in this article are met. Crucially, derogations are only possible where there are no other satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Maltese Government decided to apply this derogation for the hunting of Quails and Turtle Doves during the spring migration. However, the information sent to the Commission by the Maltese authorities was insufficient to demonstrate that the derogations granted were able to meet the requirements set out in the Birds Directive. In particular, the Maltese authorities failed to show that there were no other satisfactory solutions and that the spring hunting takes places under strictly supervised conditions. This is why the Commission concluded that the derogation granted in 2004 infringes Articles 7 and 9 of the Birds Directive. In July 2006, an infringement procedure was launched in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The abovementioned infringement case only concerns the derogation granted in 2004. However, the Commission is aware that spring hunting was permitted in the subsequent years. The Commission considers that the continuation of the spring hunting all these years without a proper justification constitutes a case of systemic bad application of the Birds Directive. Thus, in March 2007, the Commission decided to send a supplementary letter of formal notice aiming at broadening the scope of the infringement case and addressing the generalized practise of the Maltese authorities all these years. It should be stressed that the Commission gave Malta the opportunity to submit its observations on the matter within one month, i.e. a shortened deadline.</p>
<p>In their replies to the letters sent by the Commission, the Maltese authorities affirm that the derogations granted fulfil the criteria of Article 9 of the Birds Directive. The Commission is assessing the information received. If it is established that Malta has not fully complied with the Birds Directive, the Commission will not hesitate to continue the infringement procedure to its conclusion, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>On 10 May 2007, the Maltese authorities announced that legislation permitting spring hunting in 2007 of Quail and Turtle Dove would be revoked from that date. Spring hunting had commenced on 10 April 2007 and was due to terminate on 20 May 2007. The Commission welcomes the proposal of the Maltese authorities to stop spring hunting earlier than anticipated. The Commission hopes that such a move by the Maltese authorities indicates recognition of their obligations under EU law and that spring hunting in future years will not be permitted, to ensure that the infringement of the Birds Directive in relation to spring hunting may be closed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0328"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the initiative of the Honourable Member in raising the issue of chronic pain. This is a serious issue that affects the daily lives of a considerable number of citizens in Europe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is clear that the recognition of chronic pain as a medical condition varies between the Member States. This means that citizens in different parts of the Union get different access to treatment for chronic pain.</p>
<p>The Commission understands the frustration that this can cause, both to the patients concerned and their carers.</p>
<p>However, the primary responsibility for the organisation and financing of health services and medical care lies with the Member States. The Commission cannot therefore impose a single way of dealing with chronic pain at European level.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it can aim to promote better understanding and best practice through sharing experiences at European level. And it is doing so.</p>
<p>The Commission has included specific questions on how far pain restricts daily living as part of a Eurobarometer survey in 2006, to help assess the extent of this issue. It plans to issue the results in July 2007.</p>
<p>It has also funded relevant projects including "Defining best practice in palliative care" and "Highlighting the impact of headache in Europe".</p>
<p>And for this year, the Commission has specifically included 'pain management' as a topic in its 2007 Call for Proposals under the public health programme, to help support further cooperation on these issues in particular at European level.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member over potential hearing damage and other health effects from MP3 and other music players. Several national authorities have pronounced themselves on this matter.</p>
<p>Community legislation is already in place that restricts the noise level of this type of music player to 100 dB. Therefore, emitting levels above may not be safe and should not be used without additional protective measures. These levels are set by a harmonised standard: EN 60065:2002 “Audio, video and similar electronic apparatus - Safety requirements”.</p>
<p>This standard is referred to by Community product legislation as appropriate to apply for both personal music players and other equipment including such a function.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework governing the safety of this equipment is as follows:</p>
<p>The Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&amp;TTE) Directive<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1999/5/EC governing the health and safety aspects of radio equipment, including mobile phones;</p>
<p>The Low Voltage Directive (LVD) 2006/95/EC governing the health and safety of electrical equipment within certain voltage ranges;</p>
<p>The General Product Safety Directive<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (GPSD) seeks to ensure that all consumer products are safe where this aspect is not further detailed in any other “specific” EU legislation (including personal music players).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that a standard exists, the Commission is preparing a request for scientific advice on this issue. The scientific opinion will inform the Commission, who will then proceed to take the measures deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>In respect of noise limits, a firm view on this will be taken at that time. In this respect the Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the fact that most research findings on noise currently take into account not only the noise level, but also the length of time and number of exposures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware that certain new Member States believe that their quotas, negotiated in the Accession Treaty and based on a historic reference period, are too small.</p>
<p>In the new Member State, the quotas were established with the same method as for the existing Member States, i.e. the allocation was based on traditional potato starch production, taking an average of the three reference years (1999–2001 except for Lithuania, where the years 1998–2000 were used). It was not possible to take into account potato areas since data on the part of the potato production used for starch processing were not available.</p>
<p>A reallocation of unused quotas would incite higher potato starch production under quota and weaken the quota regime itself. In view of the supply situation of the potato starch market, where currently 40% of the production has to be exported and where the cereal starch becomes more and more competitive on the domestic market, this should be avoided.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission proposal is limited to a two years roll-over and does not consider any adaptation or modification of the present quota regime.

<p>(EN) The Commission is attentive to cases of restructuring in the automotive sector and is particularly concerned by the negative consequences of plant closures for the workers affected, their families and the regions in which they are situated. However, the Commission has no authority to prevent or defer the decisions of individual companies in relation to company restructurings or site closures and cannot interfere in a company's decision unless that decision violates Community law.</p>
<p>The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that Delphi Automotive España SL has received support through the European Regional Development Fund as follows:</p>
<p>€ 9 974 577 under the Operational Programme "Competitividad y Mejora del € Tejido Productivo"<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>;</p>

<p>Delphi Automotive España SL has not received any direct assistance from the European Social Fund.</p>

However, since Delphi has so far not proved the implementation of the project in question, the corresponding aid has not been paid out to the company.</p>
<p>Spain has adopted the necessary measures to transpose into its national legal order Council Directive 98/59/EC on the approximation of laws of the Member States on collective redundancies<a href="#defann_47_9" name="refann_47_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>, Council Directive 94/45/EC the European Works Councils<a href="#defann_47_10" name="refann_47_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> and Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer<a href="#defann_47_11" name="refann_47_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>. It is therefore up to the competent national authorities, notably courts, to ensure the correct and effective application of the national rules in view of the specific circumstances of each case and to ensure the fulfilment of any employer's duties in this regard.

<p>In Greece and more generally in all the EU Member States, the number of workers being 'hired out', that is to say subjected to a modern form of slavery, is increasing exponentially. While they are employed for years at a time to meet the recurrent and ongoing needs of undertakings in the public and private sector, they are not directly recruited by these undertakings but indirectly through private employment agencies which treat them like slaves. The 'hired out' workers are not covered by collective bargaining agreements and are constantly denied their freedom at the workplace and their civil liberties. In this way the agencies concerned are clearly seeking to maximise their profits by keeping earnings and benefits for workers to a minimum. In Greece, for example, according to the incomplete information available (in fact the situation is much worse) the National Bank of Greece alone employs 700 of its staff on this basis while the total number of workers employed in this way exceeds 15 000 and is steadily increasing.</p>

<p>(FR) The honourable Member highlights the situation of workers who are recruited in Greece and in the other EU Member States by private employment agencies in order to be placed at the disposal of user enterprises, the apparent objective of which procedure is to reduce the latter’s labour costs and social security contributions. At the same time, the employees concerned have little job security and are not covered by collective agreements. The situation described by the honourable Member corresponds to the triangular relationship more commonly referred to as ‘temporary work’, where agencies, as employers, make their employees available for a fixed term, with a view to providing a service to a user enterprise.</p>
<p>Many Member States, including Greece, have adopted national legislation that covers this type of situation and guarantees temporary workers adequate protection. Most of these laws establish the principle of equal treatment – not least regarding pay – between the temporary workers and permanent workers employed by user enterprises. In this case, temporary workers benefit from the provisions of the collective agreements applicable in the user enterprises. In some Member States, it is the social partners at national or sectoral level who have decided to conclude collective agreements with the specific aim of providing the workers concerned with a protective framework.</p>
<p>On 20 March 2002<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the working conditions of temporary workers. After the European Parliament issued its opinion at first reading, the Commission adopted an amended proposal on 28 November 2002<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This text lays down the general principle of equal treatment, in accordance with which the basic working and employment conditions (in particular pay and working time) of temporary workers will be at least those that would apply if the workers had been recruited directly by the user enterprise to fill the same post. This text is still awaiting discussion by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreed between the EU and China in June 2005 was a "once and for all" agreement. It comprises agreed levels for ten textile and clothing categories until 31 December 2007. It was intended to give an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new environment after the end of the Agreement for Textiles and Clothing (ATC), foreseen since 1995. The Commission is convinced that the industry put the extra time since 2005 to good use. In fact, the social partners representing European textile and clothing industry did not demand any extension of the Memorandum. They call instead for priority being given to policies guaranteeing equal market access and respect of agreed rules.</p>
<p>After the end of the MoU the textile sector will be subject to the same rules as all other economic sectors in the EU.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is monitoring and will continue to monitor the situation of trade in the textile and clothing sector and in particular the imports originating in China.</p>
<p>Should the situation warrant it, the Community has at its disposal instruments to ensure that World Trade Organisation and EU rules are respected.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0351"></a>
