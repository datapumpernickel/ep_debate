<p class="contents">I would like to begin my third appearance before you by expressing my satisfaction with the work done by the institutions throughout the Presidency, and the good relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission during the past six months. This good atmosphere of understanding is largely due to the efforts of President Pat Cox. The European Parliament and its President have made a substantial contribution to the work of the Presidency. This House has adopted the legislative approach proposed by the Lamfalussy report, the Fourth Framework Programme on Research and the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, during the last six months the Council and Parliament have adopted a definitive text on access for the European Parliament to Council documents on foreign, security and defence policy, and we have reformed the European rules on the common electoral procedure. Regarding the first matter, the Seville European Council welcomed the significant boost given to interinstitutional dialogue during the Spanish Presidency. A good example of this is the creation of the High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation, which represents a qualitative leap in those relations. That group should be the foundation for the future interinstitutional agreement on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework, to be adopted in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, when I presented the Presidency’s priorities to you, I said that Spain would work to:</p>
<p class="contents">- strengthen the Union’s response to terrorism, from the point of view of building an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice;</p>
<p class="contents">- increase modernisation of the economy;</p>
<p class="contents">- help complete the enlargement negotiations; and</p>
<p class="contents">- lay the foundations for the future European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that I can say that progress has been made in each and every one of these areas. The Presidency has moved forward with the measures in the European Union’s plan of action against terrorism. This objective would not have been possible without the support of Parliament and particularly without the support of the Commission. I remember very well that my last appearance in this House coincided with a terrorist attack in Italy. I am confident that such acts will be increasingly difficult to carry out as a result of the measures that we have adopted over recent months. We have managed to step up the European Union’s fight against terrorism by formally adopting, among others, the Framework Decisions on the Fight against Terrorism, the Framework Decision on the Arrest Warrant and the Common Position on the Freezing of Assets. All of these measures strengthen cooperation between the security bodies and forces of the Member States, help to increase the Union’s international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and extend the scope of that fight to the whole of its support structure.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the development of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, Spain had proposed, as one of the aims for its Presidency, the creation of a common immigration and asylum policy. Europe needs immigration and the majority of Europeans understand this, but in recent times we have seen the emergence of criminal mafias trafficking human beings. In order to combat illegal immigration, the Seville European Council decided to adopt a comprehensive and balanced package of measures seeking to:</p>
<p class="contents">- fight illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings;</p>
<p class="contents">- establish a coordinated and integrated management of the Union’s external borders;</p>
<p class="contents">- speed up work on defining a common asylum and immigration policy; and</p>
<p class="contents">- integrate immigration policy into the Union’s relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to expand on the last two points, which attracted the most public attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council decided to speed up the legislative work in progress on defining a common asylum and immigration policy by carrying out a series of specific actions within a specific timetable:</p>
<p class="contents">- by December of this year, we will adopt the conditions for determining which countries are responsible for processing asylum applications in the European Union;</p>
<p class="contents">- by June 2003, we will adopt rules on refugee status, reuniting families and the status of long-term permanent residents; and</p>
<p class="contents">- by December 2003, we will adopt common standards for asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that immigration needs to be incorporated into the Union’s policies towards third countries, taking into account various factors: increasing economic cooperation, expanding trade, development aid, and preventing conflicts, as these are the methods chosen by the European Union to reduce the causes of migration. The Council has therefore declared that it is willing to increase cooperation with the countries of origin of immigrants and countries of transit. If we want the Union’s aid for combating illegal immigration to be effective and also credible, we must be capable of evaluating and revising it according to the results obtained, in order to be able to react in the event of a clear lack of cooperation in curbing illegal immigration. In this case, and in exceptional circumstances, the Union reserves the right to adopt measures, as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Union’s other policies, while respecting the agreements it has made.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into circulation of the euro was an impetus for the Barcelona European Council to decisively resume the process of economic and social modernisation. As you will recall, the results of the Barcelona European Council were examined by this House when I attended on 20 March. I would just like to expand on the economic elements of the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent European Council approved the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, reaffirming the commitment to achieving a budgetary balance by 2004 and the need to continue with economic reforms, as the only way for the Union to increase its growth and achieve full employment, an objective that we agreed in Lisbon for this decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the milestone of the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Community and Member States, and the good results of the Monterrey Summit, we now have two solid foundations from which to approach the World Summit on Development in Johannesburg. This Summit will be an opportunity to fulfil our objectives of fighting poverty and environmental degradation and to promote the development of the less advanced countries. These goals will be a reality if in Johannesburg we adopt a balanced vision of all the facets of sustainable development. This is why the Seville European Council highlighted, among other things, the efforts made by the Union to promote initiatives in the areas of water, energy and health and to play a leading role, from a constructive angle, in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of the Presidency’s priorities was to move forward in enlargement negotiations. The timetable for the negotiations given to the Spanish Presidency was very demanding. By the end of this six-month period, the chapters on regional and cohesion policy, the policy of the institutions, financial issues and agriculture had to be closed. I think that the results can be described as positive. The Spanish Presidency has negotiated a total of 96 chapters, 52 of which have been provisionally closed, and 22 of which have been opened for the first time. This means that the negotiations have entered their final stage and I hope that the next European Council in Brussels will be able to nominate which countries will be able to complete the negotiations this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to dwell for a moment on the issue of direct payments in the agricultural chapter. This was the most complex subject in the negotiations, given the particular sensitivity of some Member States. The Seville European Council came up with a compromise formula that enables us to begin to negotiate with the candidates on the vast majority of the agricultural issues. The remainder of the elements in the financial package of the enlargement negotiations will be communicated to the candidate countries by November at the latest. The European Council in the autumn will therefore be able to decide with which candidate countries the negotiations can be completed at the end of 2002. In this section I would also like to mention the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania, and encourage Turkey to continue with the necessary reforms and comply with the economic and political requirements, which apply to all the candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, as President-in-Office of the European Union I inaugurated the work of the European Convention on the future of Europe on 28 February. In Seville, Chairman Giscard d’Estaing presented a report on the progress of the Convention and the various forums in which civil society has expressed itself. The European Council supports the general approach of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter that the Seville European Council dealt with was the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by Ireland. The ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a necessary condition in order to move forward, and I consider the Declaration on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by Ireland to be important, confirming that this Member State’s policy of neutrality will not be affected by that ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are also aware, the Laeken European Council asked the Secretary-General of the Council, Javier Solana, to present a report on the reform of the Council. Based on this, and in accordance with the Barcelona European Council, in Seville the Presidency presented three groups of proposals on the reform of the Council. The first group was aimed at substantially changing the preparation, development and decisions of the future European Council. The preparation work of the European Council will be the task of the new General Affairs and External Relations Council. Other measures were also adopted that will simplify the work of the European Council and make it more flexible. Meeting times will be limited and clear and concise conclusions will be adopted. In Seville a fundamental step forward was made in admitting that, in extraordinary cases, the Council may use the direction of the discussions of the European Council in order to continue to make progress on particular matters, in accordance with the procedures established in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of proposals was aimed at making the structure and functioning of the Council of Ministers more efficient and transparent. In order to achieve this, the Council has created this new General Affairs and External Relations Council. This new Council will prepare and monitor the work of the European Council, will be responsible for horizontal coordination and will guide all of the European Union’s external action. The Seville European Council also decided to decrease the number of Council of Ministers formations from sixteen to nine, adopted the rules for cooperation between Presidencies and adopted rules enabling Council sessions to be open to the public when it is acting in codecision with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Spanish Presidency has launched the debate on the six-month presidencies of the Union. Changing the current six-monthly system of presidencies means reforming the Treaties. This decision needs to be taken by the next Intergovernmental Conference. In any event, the Copenhagen European Council must continue and expand on this discussion, based on the principle of equality between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Spanish Presidency, the Union has also pursued intense external activity. The European Union summits with the United States and Canada helped to strengthen the transatlantic link. The Summit with the United States reaffirmed the special political commitment that the Union has to the United States, by adopting the agreement on the negotiation of an agreement on judicial cooperation in criminal matters, extradition and mutual assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must support Russia in President Putin’s clear commitment to defending democracy and starting on the road to reforms. It was important that the European Union Summit with Russia was successful. The inclusion of the fight against terrorism as a new sphere of cooperation between the European Union and Russia, the recognition of Russia’s status as a market economy and defining the bases for an agreement on Kaliningrad are all reasons to be optimistic about the future development of relations between the European Union and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">In mid May, the second summit between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries was held. One of the objectives of this Summit was to promote regional integration in the area. It was therefore agreed that political and cooperation agreements would be negotiated with Central America and the Andean Community, and the formal document concluding the Association Agreement between the European Union and Chile was signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain also proposed, as a priority objective for its Presidency, driving forward the Barcelona Forum, the only process in which Israelis and Palestinians directly meet. For this reason, the fact that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, where the European Parliament was represented, was actually held, can be described as a success. In Valencia the Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria was signed, and recently the Association Agreement between the European Union and Lebanon was also signed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit also adopted the Euro-Mediterranean Framework Programme on Justice and Home Affairs, adopted the reinforced Facility within the European Investment Bank and the Action Programme for the Dialogue between cultures and civilisations, and created the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation to promote that dialogue. The Spanish Presidency was particularly attentive during times of serious crisis in the Middle East. This is the reason for the two declarations adopted during the European Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has worked constantly to step up its cooperation with other international players. The importance of the Quartet, which met for the first time in Madrid, and of the Declaration adopted by the European Union, the United States, the Russian Federation and the United Nations are proof of that effort, which is continuing today, as Special Envoys of the Quartet are meeting to continue coordinating their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening the European Security and Defence Policy was also one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency. The Seville European Council adopted the Declaration on the contribution of the Common European Security Policy to the fight against terrorism. That is a first step for integrating the fight against terrorism into the Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Spanish Presidency, the European Union has also confirmed that it is prepared to take on the task of policing in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on 1 January 2003, and has expressed its desire to take over operation “Amber Fox”, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the Spanish Presidency has conducted all the negotiations in order to reach an agreement on the participation of European allies that are not Member States of the European Union in European defence. Spain and the European Union need to continue to work actively on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, today I came to the European Parliament to explain the results of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, and in particular of the Seville European Council. I think that we have moved forward on each of the Presidency’s priorities, despite the problems and uncertainties that we have faced during past months. The euro has entered into circulation without problems and was extremely well received, the European Council has decisively resumed the process of economic and social modernisation of Europe, the Union has played an important political role in the world and, finally, we have faced the problems arising from illegal immigration and succeeded in responding firmly to the threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these steps should increase our confidence in the European plan, which is a formula that has been verified and is based on success. That success is based on two principles that we should not forget: respect for different points of view and constantly seeking a balance and the Rule of Law. It is only from this twofold perspective that we will be able to face the two most immediate tasks that our future holds: enlargement and the reunification of Europe and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, which will define our institutional system.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to finish without offering my best wishes to the Danish Presidency and assuring it, of course, of Spain’s support throughout the next six months, just as they have actively cooperated with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to end as I began, by thanking you and President Cox for the work that you have done during the Spanish Presidency. I would also like to thank the Commission and its President, Romano Prodi, for their cooperation. Without that cooperation, many of the results that I have come to present to you today, would simply not have been possible.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, 2002 is a crucial year for European integration – a year marked by projects and challenges of huge political and historical significance such as enlargement and the debate on the political and institutional nature of the Union today and in the future. In the last few months, another challenge has caught our attention – immigration – which calls for more reflection on the balance we need to achieve within our societies in Europe and in relations between the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<p class="contents">We are quite familiar with the difficulties involved in these challenges and we must pay tribute to the Spanish Presidency, which has guided the Union through the last six months as it tackled all these problems with drive and wisdom. I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Aznar, his ministers and all those who worked with him for their work. I would add, moreover, that cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission has reached great heights. The Commission and Spain have established a method that can, I hope, be applied by all future Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Union’s successes in these past six months has been the way the roadmap for enlargement has been followed. At Seville, we made further progress: we achieved common positions on the chapters on agriculture and the Structural Funds and we identified the last hurdles to overcome. In the autumn, by the Brussels European Council in October, to be precise, we must have agreement within the Union on certain budgetary issues and, in particular, on direct payments to farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometime in the autumn too, the citizens of Ireland will be taking part in a second referendum to ratify the Treaty of Nice. I have every confidence that, this time, the debate will focus on the real substance of the Treaty rather than on other issues wrongly laid at the Union’s door and I therefore have no doubt that the outcome will be positive. In this connection, I see the European Council’s declaration at Seville on respect for Ireland’s military neutrality as highly significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore continue to look forward to the Copenhagen European Council with great optimism. We are gradually overcoming the potential obstacles to a definitive decision on enlargement. The great commitment displayed by the candidate countries over the last few years deserves to meet with success. I cannot stress too often that enlargement and the related reforms are and will remain our main political priority and that the Commission will spare no effort to reach that goal, a goal whose strategic importance stretches far beyond the confines of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Asylum and immigration were high on the Seville European Council’s agenda, and what prevailed at Seville were common sense, good judgment and moderation. Illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings are unacceptable and the EU has made it clear that it will do its utmost to put a stop to them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a declaration of intent. At Seville, clear recommendations and timeframes were laid down, for example for the conclusion of the re-admission agreements currently being negotiated and the launching of talks with the other countries identified by the Council, the implementation of joint operations at external borders before the end of 2002, and the introduction of common visa arrangements by March 2003. The importance of these timeframes must in no way be underestimated. Experience teaches us that we can only make coherent progress by setting definite dates. I assure you we will work to ensure those commitments are met on time.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, however, immigration calls for a comprehensive approach that takes all the political, social and human dimensions fully into account. Border control is bound up with asylum policies, security is linked to ensuring fair treatment for all the citizens and internal security, and the effectiveness of the various decisions and measures within the Union depends on the relations with third countries and the development cooperation we are able to achieve too.</p>
<p class="contents">Recovering the spirit of Tampere, the Council neglected none of these aspects and demonstrated considerable even-handedness. This is reassuring for all the citizens, for those who are concerned about the future of legal immigrants, who believe in open, tolerant societies, and for those who are worried about illegal immigration and the people who exploit it and who therefore want security stepped up. Of course, there is more to security than just managing immigration: it also depends on a number of issues which need to be addressed <span class="italic">en bloc,</span> where a comprehensive Union approach can really make a difference. Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the lessons we must learn from Seville, where there was an even clearer awareness that some problems cannot be solved purely at national level, and there is a need for courageous, far-sighted policies and decisions at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as it draws near, enlargement is generating a wave of reform throughout the entire Union. This is focused on two main areas: the Convention, which is about to wind up the first phase of its work, and the three main institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the chairmanship of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the Convention’s task is to devise lasting solutions for the Europe of tomorrow consisting of 25 Member States or more, and to think about the type of Union we want for our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, however, there are other processes under way, both within the EU and on its doorstep, as Mr Aznar said in his speech, and these demand that we review the workings of the institutions as of now – resolutely, swiftly and pragmatically – without waiting for the Treaties to be amended and without interfering in the work of the Convention. The Convention is sacrosanct: even minimal interference is out of the question. The impact of enlargement on the way the institutions function must, for example, be assessed immediately, so the necessary measures can be put in place by the beginning of 2004 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must not forget that the Community system depends on a fine balance between our institutions, based on a set of checks and balances, with the institutions functioning interdependently. Any change affecting one institution will thus have a structural impact on all the others. A coordinated and concerted approach is therefore vital in the streamlining processes underway in all the institutions. I am pleased to note that, in some ways, this is already happening more or less spontaneously. The Corbett report to Parliament, the Solana report and our own proposals on reforming the way the Commission works all point in the same direction. In particular, the new rules approved at Seville concerning the European Council and the other Council configurations and my ideas on reforming the College of Commissioners have a great deal in common. Both initiatives organise the activities of their respective institutions in a more flexible and simpler way, identifying a set of core tasks and assigning them to coordination bodies with clearly determined responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at this historic time, creative solutions must be found right away with the instruments to hand – with the instruments we have already, without amending the Treaties. As I said before, however, we must act coherently. That is also the idea behind our set of proposals on better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that the Seville European Council decided to set up a High-Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation and that it called on the three institutions to adopt an interinstitutional agreement before the end of the year to improve the quality of Community legislation and its transposal into national law. This is the task before us in the coming months and I am sure we will tackle it calmly, with dedication and in the spirit of cooperation that has now become a feature of our relations. I would like to thank you, Members of Parliament, and Mr Aznar and his colleagues, for precisely that spirit of cooperation, for we have worked pragmatically and energetically in the last six months.</p>

Mr President, I wish, on behalf of our group, to warmly thank the Spanish Presidency and extend my congratulations on a successful term of office, sentiments already expressed by the vigorous applause from the whole House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, you have come to Parliament on three occasions, thus setting an example to other presidencies, and one that I hope they will follow. A free society can endure only if we determinedly resist every form of terrorism, and you demonstrated exemplary commitment to doing this in the face of ETA terrorism in Spain long before 11 September 2001. On behalf of our group, I would like to tell you that we are ready, willing and alongside you in the defence of freedom and democracy against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you have said, Mr President, you have covered important ground on asylum and immigration policy. We are in favour of our making our borders secure, and we also advocate that border patrols be integrated on European lines, but, as you also said, it is important that we deal firmly with the causes of immigration and counteract them, and the Valencia conference played an important part in building up the Mediterranean dialogue. We in the PPE-DE group are firmly convinced that our relations with the Arab and Islamic world need to be put on a firmer footing. We must not allow ourselves to treat terrorism and the Arab and Islamic world as if they were one and the same thing, and should do everything possible, in North Africa in particular, to create a society in which conditions are such that young people do not emigrate, but have a future in their own homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President Aznar, both you and Commission President Prodi spoke about the enlargement of the European Union. I wish to thank you for your active involvement, as a representative of the southern part of the European Union, in the issue of the accession of the countries of Central Europe, and also of course Cyprus and Malta. My group has expressly mandated me to state that we consider it irresponsible for a head of government, in this case the German Federal Chancellor, to make enlargement conditional on the results achieved in negotiations on the agriculture chapter with regard to payments. We consider this irresponsible because it does damage to confidence in the European Union in the candidate countries, the end result being that anti-European feeling in these countries is intensified. We therefore urge you and request you...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... no, you do not like hearing that said, but I am telling the truth, and if you were to criticise that, my dear sir, you would make yourself rather more credible than you do by interrupting!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you have also committed yourself to contending for the Stability Pact, and we will also say here that it is on stability that confidence in the common European currency is founded. Whether the country concerned is large or small, any violation by it of the Stability and Growth Pact must mean that a warning letter is actually sent and received, and I call on us all to defend the stability of the European currency.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the Convention. I strongly welcome that, and we advocate Community solutions to be worked out by the Convention. It has been possible, under the Spanish Presidency, to take a great step forward with the Interinstitutional Agreement on Foreign, Security and Defence Policy, yet there are now rumours to the effect that the General Secretariat of the Council is absolutely unwilling to classify certain documents. I hope this will not result in our ending up being denied documents, but rather that what has been agreed will actually be delivered, as the Spanish Presidency has managed to do. We have a great deal of faith in the expected Interinstitutional Agreement, the conclusion of which is being worked on at a high level, not only by experts, but also by politicians, in order to bring about genuinely better lawmaking in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, I wish to conclude by congratulating you on the reform of the Council, which is going in the right direction; I believe it is on this basis that we should carry on working in the future. On behalf of our group, I thank you for a successful presidency, and we have confidence in the Spanish government and in Spain's Prime Minister that under the Danish Presidency we will be able to continue along the road on which we have travelled for the past six months. In this spirit, I wish you and all of us great success for the next six months in this European Union in which we share.</p>

<p class="contents">Allow me to make an initial observation on the atmosphere of Seville which was not only in a holiday period, but in Easter week, in a city that is defined as being the capital of the three cultures. We are against a fortress Europe and, above all, a Europe that is impregnable to European citizens, and we therefore think that an explanation is needed here as to why European and Iberian citizens, specifically Portuguese citizens, in this case, and elected representatives, were prevented from exercising their right to go to Seville.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the six-month presidency, the President-in-Office of the Council beat me to my criticism. He himself, both here and in Oxford, has criticised six-month presidencies. I have to express my agreement with this because, obviously, the book of Genesis cannot be rewritten every six months. Every six months a new Europe begins and that cannot be. For example, regarding the Spanish Presidency, the Lisbon process, which was a balanced process, cannot be recreated with different objectives. It is important to have energy, and we are in favour of liberalising energy, not simply privatising it, but we need to look after public services and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, with regard to immigration and asylum: two years ago there was an overall discussion in Tampere. The Swedish Presidency raised the important issue for Europe of our demography. Now it seems that everything is focused around illegal immigration. Does what the previous European Councils have done not count? We do not have a memory of the past, and this is an important point, because it has to be said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you gave the Justice and Home Affairs Council some very strict tasks: we have been waiting in the European Parliament for a more proactive and less repressive European policy to be made on immigration, through the codecision procedure. There have been five directives that have been waiting for the Council to do its work. That is the first thing.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have to say that the Presidency, and it has not been the only one to do this, has systematically avoided thorny issues. It has adopted many chapters of enlargement, but it has to be said that the most important part is yet to be done. I would like to point out that the European Parliament, as in previous enlargements, has always said that enlargement requires a review of the financial perspectives, and you are doing this by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party has adopted a document on the necessary reform of the agricultural policy and you are doing it in private, without a public debate, and even without listening to what the Commission is proposing, which may be very debatable, but you have a responsibility to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement, I understand that Mr Poettering, in the German pre-election climate, is attacking Chancellor Schröder as a candidate. What he does not seem to have heard is what Mr Stoiber says about enlargement, which is even stronger.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that it will be very difficult for the Danish Presidency to complete the pending issues from Seville in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I have to say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you, a pedigree politician, have conducted your task in a manner that has broken with the neutrality of the presidencies. You have quite openly said, regarding what is happening in my country, that the socialists are at fault. You have systematically blamed the governments from my political family for problems and scored points off them. That is not the tradition of European presidencies, and I think that we should return to a more neutral type of presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is the subject of democratic control and the reform of the Council. It is true that we have concluded the agreement on access to documents. You took the step of placing the negotiation on how to legislate better at a political level. When you say that you are going to open up the Council in its capacity of codecision with Parliament, you tell us to access it via the Internet. We invite you when we have a codecision process. The least that you can do is to officially invite us when you have a codecision process. We are not just members of the public who should find out through the press.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, allow me also to mention your proposal for a Presidency of the Council for five years. In January I said that you could be good hosts for the Convention, because you had not expressed your opinion. Now that you have openly expressed it, I have to say that, as a European democrat, I am against us recreating the Holy Roman Germanic Empire and I am in favour of maintaining the Community method.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the key test of Seville was the agreement on immigration and asylum which elevated discussion beyond the search for cheap newspaper headlines and into the core of the challenge. A casual reader of the newspapers in the run-up to Seville might have believed that the Prime Minister of Spain was playing Don José to Tony Blair's Carmen in a passionate but deadly delusion about using development aid as a weapon in the crackdown on illegal migrants. We, therefore, welcome the success of Prime Minister Verhofstadt and others in redressing the balance of the European Council's draft conclusions. In particular we are pleased that the Council recalled the importance of economic cooperation, free trade, development aid and conflict prevention in tackling the causes of illegal immigration. I applaud the Council's emphasis on providing incentives to developing countries to cooperate in the management of migration flows rather than on suspending development aid for non-cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, rather than simply setting new targets for achieving progress on immigration and asylum, Heads of State and Government would do better to stop clogging up the decision-making process with national initiatives and to back Commission proposals under the Community method. That means using qualified majority voting to ensure that decisions can be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the proposals for reform of the proceedings of the Council, it is all very well for Heads of State and Government to talk about introducing greater transparency into the workings of the Council. However, this will not be achieved merely by allowing cameras into the room for a ritual round-table debate and for the votes. We need to achieve real transparency by giving access to Council documents on the Internet, from when they are first discussed by officials right up to ministerial level. It is disgraceful that Council officials in the Secretariat are refusing to make Room documents and unnumbered documents publicly available.</p>
<p class="contents">A rationalisation of the number of Councils is no doubt called for, but it would be far better for this to be done in conjunction – as the President of the Commission said – with similar moves in Parliament and in the Commission so that lines of accountability and responsibility are clear. I am also concerned that the abolition of the Development Council could be seen as a downgrading of the Union's role in development assistance, which must not be allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Barcelona Summit, I warned in this Chamber of the danger of a credibility gap opening up if the ambitious targets set for economic reform were not implemented. In particular I called for progress to be made towards an integrated financial services market. I, therefore, warmly congratulate the Spanish Presidency on securing a deal on the pensions directive – which had been blocked in Council since July of last year – as well as agreement on the market abuse directive, because behind the sound and fury over illegal immigration it is steady progress on technical but vital issues such as these which show the worth of a presidency.</p>

<p class="contents">It is astonishing how little the priorities that Mr Aznar set out in this House at the start of the Presidency bear relation to the activity of the European Union during the past six months. He has shown a remarkable capacity to adapt in changing his priorities. For example, when it became complicated to fulfil the enlargement objectives, the subject of illegal immigration was introduced. The priority of terrorism was a focus that partly reduced the much broader mandate from Laeken, focused on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In actual fact there has not been any significant progress made on this aspect, and the issue of terrorism has consisted basically of the arrest warrant which had already been partly drawn up by the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">His capacity to adapt becomes even clearer if we consider that at the start of the Presidency, for example, the Commission’s proposals on immigration had been shelved. In Seville an attempt was made to deal with the issue of immigration solely and basically from a repressive and policing point of view. Fortunately, some Member States toned down his proposals in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Integration policies, family reunification cases, long-term resident status and common regulation of migratory flows have been put aside, or more correctly, are still to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The slogan for your Presidency, Mr Aznar, was "more Europe”, and one of the priorities and perhaps the one with the greatest political scope was that associated with the enlargement of the European Union. It is true that a good number of chapters have been closed, but they are not all of equal importance. The agricultural chapter was the main one, and within it, direct aid is much more important than any other subject. The Commission’s tight-fisted proposal on agriculture is rejected by the majority of the candidate countries. Also, the blocking of the General Affairs Council by four Member States demonstrates the magnitude of the problem, a subject on which not much progress was made in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of Member States want a larger market, but not more Europe. The reasons are budgetary and the objective is partly to dismantle or reduce the few common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We do need more Europe, Mr Aznar; a larger Europe, but not one that is void of content. The argument that you used before the Seville European Council is not valid: "futile efforts lead to melancholy ". The Presidency must do everything in its power to fulfil the final objectives. Mr Aznar, in Barcelona I do not think that you had any problem with pressuring France to the end regarding the liberalisation of electricity, despite the fact that there was an electoral process underway in that country. However, with the current electoral process in another country, you have not acted in the same way, in order to avoid pressure on enlargement and the reduction of the CAP, because you must consider it to be a futile effort. Although I am not justifying the attitude to liberalisation, it is clear that you have used two different yardsticks.</p>
<p class="contents">Your approach to economic aspects has also been partial and reductionist. You have managed to make a very neo-liberal mark on the Lisbon process, forgetting its content on quality employment, social cohesion and the role of social dialogue. You refuse to recognise the new economic stage, which has now moved far from the predictions of Lisbon; you maintain an inflexible interpretation in the economic guidelines of the Stability pact, but, at the same time, an “every man for himself” attitude so that some Member States can solve their budget balancing problems. That cannot be described as more Europe either.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, you literally stated your intention to create an area of greater economic prosperity to safeguard the European social model. The Barcelona European Council and the policies that your Government intends to implement in Spain are proof to the contrary. And from Barcelona to Seville, Mr Aznar, a general strike was called. There could be no other way, because your labour reform, cutting unemployment protection and making dismissal cheaper, is a further indicator of what the Spanish Presidency understands by making the labour market more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">During your Presidency, Mr Aznar, the European Union has not played a truly leading role in finding a fair solution to the conflict in the Middle East, and your proposals on Latin America and the Mediterranean have been incomprehensibly low-profile.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, Mr Aznar, we cannot make a positive assessment of your Presidency. The positive aspects: the Galileo project, the health insurance card, and some other things, pale into insignificance against these reasons that I have tried to outline, at least for us.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot make more Europe by allowing social policies, public services and common European policies to deteriorate. We need more Europe but also, and above all, a better Europe. Another Europe is possible, as thousands of citizens have been increasingly demanding more and more before every European Council, and particularly during your Presidency, in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Seville. More Europe, yes, but a more supportive, more human Europe that serves citizens more and has a greater presence on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also be grateful, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you could clarify the issue of what happened with Portugal regarding these demonstrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr Aznar, time – that tyrannical ruler - prevents me from dwelling on the positive aspects of your Presidency. There have been positive aspects, even in my group’s opinion, but my task is to focus in particular on a few matters which give us cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards immigration and asylum, we were relieved to see that your proposal to link development aid – which is already appallingly low – to the Union’s aspirations of controlling illegal immigration did not receive support at Seville. In our opinion, in indulging the basest instincts of the far right, we would not be responding to the justified concerns of the citizens. We already have the bases of a coherent, comprehensive asylum and immigration policy – it is just that the Commission’s proposals have been lying stagnant for too long in the Council. We must follow the usual legislative procedures if we want to find a solution to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of your Presidency, I expressed both my hope that that you would enjoy these six months and a criticism of the fact that your programme did not include a clear definition of your vision of Europe or of the role of the institutions. I can now observe that you appear to have enjoyed your term of office so much that you presented a vision of the Union in which not only would the governments remain in control of the Union but the Council Presidency would become an elected post and last for more than six months, thus competing directly with the Commission Presidency and upsetting the interinstitutional balance. We oppose this vision, Mr Aznar, for we feel it runs counter to the urgent need to make the Union more democratic and effective, and it is our fervent hope that the Convention will not follow it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, moreover, like to echo Mr Watson’s words and express our concern and our opposition to the abolition of the Development Council, for this can only lead to development policy becoming even more subordinate to the geopolitical and trade policies of the European Union and, in particular, of its most powerful States. The dissolution of the Development Council could, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, presage the dismantling of the Development Directorate-General, and we would indeed request some reassurance from President Prodi that this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say a few words on the Johannesburg Summit: we were extremely surprised not to find any reference in the conclusions to the disturbing failure of the Bali Summit or to the European Union initiatives to relaunch the sustainable development strategy. This strategy cannot be based solely on the liberalisation of trade, and still less, as even the Commission appears to be suggesting, on nuclear energy. If this is really the Union’s strategy for Johannesburg, it is my sincere opinion that Johannesburg will become Rio–10, not Rio+10.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Aznar, as environmentalists, we were quite sure that little would be achieved in these six months in the area of the environment, but it is fair to say that we can derive some pleasure from the fact that, thanks, not least, to a huge public campaign which we wholeheartedly supported, your efforts to use the Council Presidency to further the progress of the national hydrological plan, especially to obtain Union funding for it, and to reform fisheries policy along the lines desired by the Spanish Government have not met with success.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Aznar, I too would like to know why Green Party representatives have been involved in problems on the borders with Portugal. I am really extremely curious to hear what you have to say on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the key objectives which the Spanish Government set out for its presidency of the European Union have been achieved. Negotiations for the prospective enlargement of the European Union have accelerated at a strong pace and it is now likely that negotiations with many of the applicant countries may indeed be concluded before the end of this year. This is a tight timeframe, but one which can now be achieved because of the strong progress which has been made over the last six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona meeting earlier this spring ensured that the ongoing development of the European economy remains a centre stage priority. EU governments fully recognise that the development of the European economy cannot be achieved unless we take full advantage of new and evolving information technologies. The promotion of e-business activities, e-health programmes, e-government and e-learning initiatives under the auspices of the e-Europe Action Plan 2005 is being implemented in its entirety across the length and breadth of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe is still a barrier to job creation. Under the Spanish Presidency the new charter for small and medium-sized enterprises was put into effect to help European business grow and prosper more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the pensions systems in Europe has also been prioritised. The citizens of Europe are unfortunately growing older and EU governments are going to have to be innovative to ensure that public and private pension programmes are both supported and protected. We must implement initiatives which guarantee that older people in our society can lead fulfilling lives with confidence and with a full sense of reassurance that their needs are fully protected.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, the Seville Summit was a most important one. We are all aware in this Chamber that the people of Ireland rejected the provisions of the Nice Treaty last year by a small margin. One of the concerns for many Irish people was the issue of whether the Nice Treaty would jeopardise Ireland's traditional neutrality. Irish troops have a proud record of serving in peace-keeping and humanitarian missions abroad under the auspices of United Nations mandates and the Irish people want this to continue to be the case in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the two declarations agreed in Seville, one signed by the Irish Government and the other approved by the European Council. In essence, these declarations spell out in clear and unequivocal terms the fact that Ireland's policy of neutrality is fully protected. In line with our traditional policy of military neutrality, Ireland is not bound by any mutual defence commitment. Irish defence forces serving overseas require United Nations approval, the agreement of the Irish Government and the approval of the Irish Parliament. Our European partners have declared that the Nice Treaty does not impose any defence commitments on any Member State of the European Union. I am hopeful that these declarations will fully clarify the political concerns that people had with this specific issue during the last Nice Treaty referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland's home lies in Europe, both historically and politically. Isolation in Europe would only bring economic uncertainty to our country, which has a high level of inward investment comprising hundreds of thousands of jobs. We want to ensure that we remain a popular location for outside investors, who view Ireland as a gateway to the single market within the European Union. We do not want to jeopardise what has been a successful job creation mechanism by sending out strong signals to investors that we do not want to remain at the heart of the European Union and at the heart of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very clear that the problem of illegal immigration in Europe is one that needs to be tackled and I welcome the agreement reached by our leaders to intensify their coordinating efforts at sea and land borders to halt illegal immigration into the Union. We must continue to coordinate with countries where high levels of illegal immigration originate and we must ensure that organised criminals involved in the sinister business of human trafficking are arrested and prosecuted for their crimes. Finally, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has been a very successful one. I thank it sincerely. Let us all work with the Danish Government to continue the progress over the next six months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is at least a start. We are now overtaking North Korea, which is the only country in the world that prefers to legislate behind closed doors. We are still a long way, however, from the transparency that characterises our national parliaments when they legislate. All other countries in the world still wish to be more open than ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to thank the Spanish foreign minister, Mr Piqué, for the commitment he gave at the Conference of Presidents to let us have all the documents from the Council’s working parties. If that pledge is fulfilled, Spain will be able to go down in history as the presidency which opened up the EU in earnest. That would be splendid for the country which, together with France and Germany, has traditionally combated openness.</p>
<p class="contents">In Seville, however, France and Luxembourg blocked a more extensive opening-up of Council meetings. The Spanish proposal would have opened up all locations at which a certain number of stars on a document indicates that the codecision procedure is being followed. Mr Chirac said ‘no’, together with Mr Jean—Claude Juncker. I should like to call upon our fellow MEPs from France and Luxembourg to give their ministers a lesson in openness and parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment, now, on the famous telephone conversation between Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar. Would you propose a treaty amendment entitling all prime ministers to telephone the President of the Commission on a Sunday in order to have a proposal deferred and inconvenient officials dismissed on the Monday? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am also sorry to have to say that we are marching on just as blindly towards EU enlargement to include Europe’s former Eastern bloc countries. Although I am personally and as a matter of fundamental principle in favour of enlargement, this cannot simply be done without first taking all the necessary measures, thus ensuring that enlargement does not cause a mass migration towards the west.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Irish people are going to the polling stations once again.
