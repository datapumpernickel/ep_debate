<p class="contents">The budget for the year 2004 is of historic significance, first and foremost because it takes into account the enlargement of the European Union to 25 States next May. The preparation of the institutions for enlargement started with the current budget. At the same time, this is the first budget to be established according to the new Activity-Based Budgeting presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget that I am going to present to you incorporates a number of items that were discussed at length during the traditional conciliation meeting last July. I am sure that cooperation in budgetary matters, as set out by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, initiated with trialogues and the July conciliation meeting, will continue for the rest of the year, and that it will allow the two arms of the budgetary authority, with the assistance of the Commission, to adopt a budget for 2004 which is satisfactory in all respects by the end of this budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council used the preliminary draft budget of the European Communities submitted by the Commission on 30 April as the basis for establishing the draft budget. The preliminary draft budget contained figures for the 25-Member State Union but, for purely legal reasons, the Council adopted a draft budget for 2004 for the 15-Member State Union, while also agreeing on a position for the 25-Member State Union with a view to achieving a political agreement with the European Parliament by the end of the budgetary procedure. The figures concerning the draft budget established by the Council that I will mention today thus relate to the 15-Member State Union. The transition to a budget for the 25-Member State Union will then be made during the first part of 2004 by means of a specific amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council established a draft budget for 2004 that includes commitment appropriations for a total of EUR 100.066 billion. This represents an increase of 0.4% over the 2003 budget. It should be noted that this is the first time that the draft budget has exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark in commitments. It includes payment appropriations for a total of EUR 95.034 billion. This represents a decrease of 2.54% on the 2003 figure.</p>
<p class="contents">The total payment appropriations provided for in the draft budget amount to 0.98% of Community Gross National Income.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget for 2004 established by the Council takes into due consideration the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure. Moreover, it is fully in line with the Council's conclusions on the budget guidelines for 2004 adopted in March 2003. Lastly, it takes into account the conclusions of the conciliation meeting of 16 July 2003 between the European Parliament and the Council, with the participation of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we endeavoured to comply with the annual expenditure ceilings set by the Financial Perspective for 2002-2006, to leave, where possible, adequate margins below the ceiling for the various headings, with the exception of headings 2 and 7, and, lastly, to provide sufficient funding for the European Union's various priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning more specific points, the Council made some changes to the nomenclature proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget and, as in the past, rejected the inclusion of the European Development Fund in the general budget. Generally speaking, it followed the classification proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, while emphasising that all expenditure concerning pensions, the common agricultural policy, veterinary and plant health, and international fisheries agreements constitute compulsory expenditure pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the above, the Council was guided by the following principles in establishing the draft budget for 2004: examination in the autumn, as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement, of an amending letter concerning agricultural expenditure, in order to take account of the updated estimates of requirements, without immediately ruling out a reduction in appropriations for agricultural expenditure. The letter of amendment should also take into account the effects of the revision of the common agricultural policy and any requirements related thereto.</p>
<p class="contents">The second guiding principle was honouring of the commitments written into the Financial Perspective for structural measures<span class="italic">. </span>Regarding the level of payment appropriations, the Council, like last year, invited the Commission to present a preliminary draft amending budget if the appropriations included in the 2004 budget for the Structural Funds - as well as for agricultural expenditure - prove insufficient to cover the payments to be made. Moreover, the Council noted that the payment appropriations included in the 2004 budget concerning programming periods prior to 2002 are intended for financing measures which have been suspended for legal reasons and similar situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle was the identification of genuine requirements within the financial envelope for internal policies,<span class="italic"> </span>taking into account the possibilities for implementation of appropriations and bearing in mind the need to maintain a margin below the ceiling for that heading of the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council applied the same principle when deciding on amounts for external action<span class="italic">.</span> In this connection, the Council asked the Commission not to pre-programme the equivalent of 15% of the appropriations for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning, more specifically, the common foreign and security policy budget, what is known as the CFSP budget, the Council included in the draft budget a CFSP budget amounting to EUR 52.6 million in commitment and payment appropriations, transferring EUR 2 million for the peace and stabilisation process - budget line 19 03 03 - to line 19 07 04 and also creating a new line to contain appropriations (transferred from the Council's section of the budget) for the Special Representatives. The new line for Special Representatives is allocated EUR 3.1 million.</p>
<p class="contents">A fifth principle was the acceptance of the preliminary draft budget for expenditure on pre-accession aid<span class="italic"> </span>concerning commitment appropriations. Regarding the level of payment appropriations, the Council has asked the Commission to submit a preliminary draft amending budget if the payment appropriations entered in the 2004 budget for pre-accession aid are insufficient to cover the payments to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to administrative expenditure, the Council stresses the importance of maintaining a sufficient margin below the ceiling of heading 5 of the Financial Perspective in line with sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">While agreeing to a rigorous approach for heading 5, the Council stressed that the appropriations and the items necessary for the success of enlargement should be provided for in the 2004 budget. The end result must, without a doubt, be a margin very close to the margin which resulted from the Council's first reading. The Council considers that the opportunity afforded by the accession of ten new Member States should be exploited and additional endeavours made to increase the effectiveness of the organisational structures and management of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also add that the Council reserves the right, as provided for in the budgetary procedure, to return to the question of the posts requested by the Commission, provided that the Commission presents new arguments, in particular as regards vacant posts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the establishment of the draft budget, there was particular focus on the possibilities for implementation of the appropriations. Thus, in deciding the amount of payment appropriations to be entered in the draft budget, the Council duly took into account the rate of implementation of previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the rate of growth of the overall payment appropriations, the Council stresses, in particular, the importance of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, and the need to keep the rate of increase of the overall payment appropriations as low as possible, taking into account the results of its first reading. Recent examples of huge surpluses and reimbursements of unused payment appropriations should certainly guide us in the direction of sensible budgeting with regard to the total amount of payment appropriations, resulting in realistic estimations of payment appropriations which are genuinely needed during the budgetary year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s concern regarding the level of payment appropriations is even more understandable and important in the current economic climate, in which – as you are all aware - national budgets are facing serious difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have all received a comprehensive explanatory memorandum, I do not think that it is necessary to make a detailed presentation now. However, I would like to underline the main points of this draft budget in the fields covered by the different headings of the Financial Perspective:</p>
<p class="contents">As regards heading 1, relating to agricultural expenditure, the Council has accepted an across-the-board cut of EUR 160 million in the appropriations requested in the preliminary draft budget for all budget lines under subheading 1a - Market expenditure - where the amount of appropriations is greater than EUR 1 billion. This reduction is in line with the overall approach of controlled growth of payment appropriations. I must stress the fact that this approach concerns both headings that include compulsory expenditure and headings that include non-compulsory expenditure, like subheading 1a. As regards subheading 1b, dealing with rural development, the Council has accepted the amounts proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding heading 2, relating to<span class="italic"> </span>structural operations, commitment appropriations have been fully budgeted as proposed by the Commission, in accordance with the conclusions of the March 1999 Berlin European Council. Concerning payment appropriations, an across-the-board reduction of EUR 138 million has been applied for the budget lines concerning Community initiatives, due to the under-implementation of corresponding budget headings in previous years. Moreover, EUR 22 million in payment appropriations proposed by the Commission for the scrapping of fishing vessels have not been accepted, consistently with the rejection of corresponding commitment appropriations in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards heading 3, concerning internal policies, the Council has accepted the amounts proposed by the Commission for the 15-Member State Union relating to multiannual programmes adopted under the codecision procedure. As regards appropriations included in the draft budget relating to codecided programmes for the 25-Member State Union, I must, of course, stress that they are provisional, pending an agreement on new reference amounts, which are currently under discussion. In addition, it has increased the proposed amounts for some budget lines that are not based on multiannual programmes. Appropriations have also been reduced for subsidies for a number of agencies while, at the same time, account has been taken of the special situation of agencies that are new or starting up. It has decided not to accept two new areas of preparatory actions relating to chemical products and to the security of supply of conventional forms of energy. At the same time, the Council has accepted only partially the new preparatory action for European security research. It has decided on an increase in appropriations for the Argo programme, to take account of the conclusions of the European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003, for the forest protection programmes and for Prince, an information programme, specifically the part dealing with the promotion of the European Union's role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the Council has provided adequate funding for priorities within heading 3. A margin of EUR 77.78 million has been left below the ceiling of the heading, allowing the European Parliament to finance its own priorities and preserving the possibility of financing future requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards heading 4, relating to external action, I can assure you that the Council has accepted the appropriations proposed by the Commission across the board. However, the Council has reduced some appropriations, making small cuts in a limited number of non-geographical budget lines; it has made a slight cut in the appropriations for geographical headings other than those relating to the Balkans, for which the amount entered in the preliminary draft budget has been accepted. It has accepted the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the CFSP budget, together with two transfers of appropriations, one from the CFSP budget to transitional civilian administrations for the Stability Pact and the other from the Council budget to the CFSP budget, giving a final total for the CFSP budget of EUR 52.6 million, as already explained. It has also accepted the appropriations proposed by the Commission for international fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has left a margin of EUR 145.95 million below the ceiling of heading 4, allowing the European Parliament to finance its own priorities and ensuring that it will be possible to finance future needs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards heading 5, relating to administrative expenditure, the Council's scrutiny of the institutions' administrative expenditure was based on the following principles. One: leaving an adequate margin within the ceiling under heading 5, in the interests of sound financial management. This margin should incorporate an amount for the future budget of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Two: making allowance, in expenditure, for the impact of the revision of the Staff Regulations following the political agreement reached within the Council on 19 May 2003. Three: limiting the increase in current expenditure to 2.7% in 2003, this being the maximum rate of increase for the 15-Member State Union. Four: accepting exceptional expenditure put forward by institutions, such as the move of the Commission to the Berlaymont building or the replacement of members of the Commission or of the Court of Justice. Five: not accepting the creation of new posts or upgrading of posts for ordinary purposes, save in exceptional cases. Six: accepting all the new posts requested for enlargement according to language requirements; the minor reductions in other posts requested were mainly for C and D posts; the period for which posts approved have been budgeted for in the draft budget is 6 months. Seven: accepting most of the appropriations requested for enlargement. Eight: accepting the pensions appropriations, after making allowance for the impact of the revision of the Staff Regulations. Nine: placing in reserve the appropriations intended for subsidies under the former Chapter A-30, in the absence of legal bases, which are currently under discussion. The result is that a margin of EUR 128.45 million is left below the ceiling for heading 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end my presentation of the different headings of the Financial Perspective with heading 7, relating to pre-accession instruments, for which the draft budget includes the proposed commitment appropriations. As regards payment appropriations, the Council requested a cut of EUR 100 million, in order to take into account underimplementation in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that this draft budget provides adequate funding for the European Union's various priorities while, at the same time, preparing the Union and its institutions so that enlargement can take place under the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this budgetary procedure is only at the beginning and that there is still a long way to go until the final adoption of the budget for 2004 in December. I believe that all the necessary conditions are there for a satisfactory budget to be achieved at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that all three Institutions represented here today - European Parliament, Council and Commission - will do their utmost to give the European Union the necessary means to take up the challenges that await us, bearing in mind that this budget is ultimately financed, as always, by the citizens of the European Union. In particular, I hope that we will reach agreement not only on the 2004 budget for the 15-Member State Union but also on the figures that will be entered in an amending budget for the 25-Member State Union to be adopted in 2004, so that the integration of the new Members States into the Union will be a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wynn, Terence (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Magri for his speech. I do not need to remind Members that this is the last budget of this Parliament. If we look back over the last four years, we can see that there have been significant changes to the way in which the budgetary procedure has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who have been here for a long time have seen many changes, not least in the relationship between Parliament and Council. We now have a minister who will sit here for three hours or so in a budgetary debate, as we had last year, which says a lot about the Council. At one time we never saw a Council minister here at this point in the budget process. I say that to be complimentary, not to be insulting. There have been a lot of cultural changes in the way the process has evolved. I suppose that we are now less confrontational. There is now more codecision between the two arms of the budgetary authority, especially when we talk about the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation process that takes place in November each year is a real conciliation. I am not too sure whether the July conciliation still serves much purpose, but the November conciliation proves its worth. There has been respect on both sides for the fact that we are the two arms of the budgetary authority. I hope that the changes we have seen over the past four years will be taken forward when the Convention is finally ratified and Parliament given its rightful place as one arm of the budgetary authority, thereby maintaining its strategic role for future years.</p>
<p class="contents">Over these last four years I have had the pleasure of being Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. This will probably be my last budget as Chairman - I hear one or two boos at the back there - but I am looking forward to seeing this budget through.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been non-stop ever since we were elected in 1999. The first thing we had to do was try to get an agreement on the flexibility instrument for the rebuilding of Kosovo. That was quickly followed by successive discussions and arguments with the Council about how to fund Serbia, Afghanistan, the notorious fisheries agreement, and even this year we had the problem of Category 5 and how we were going to fund the administration expenditure that was needed.</p>
<p class="contents">This period has not been without its moments. At the beginning of this year, someone asked me whether there were any problems ahead for the 2004 budget. In a moment of weakness I said, 'no, not really'. That is, however, if we do not include enlargement, potential problems with Iraq later on or activity-based budgeting. But, since we do have to include these matters, we have to try and sort them all out.</p>
<p class="contents">All those issues need to be resolved. The 2004 budget will be far from easy for a variety of reasons, firstly because it is in the ABB - activity-based budgeting - format. The fact is that we now have to vote in a different way for a different structure, and hopefully get it right, as well as deal with enlargement. We are voting on a new structure and then we will be voting for 10, 15 or 25 countries, depending on the way you look at it. It will be difficult because of the different amendments from the groups and committees, not least including the extremely interesting amendment by the PPE-DE Group requesting EUR 500 million for the rebuilding of Iraq. I will touch on that shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Financial Regulation is also complicating matters, especially the A-30 lines. Whilst these matters are just peanuts, they seem to take up a lot of time in the committees, as every member of the Committee on Budgets knows. There is also the real question of what the real needs of enlargement are, especially within the institutions. How do we determine that reality from the proposals of the Commission as well as of all the other institutions? The two rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, have striven manfully to try to get answers to that - I am not excluding Parliament here either.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that this budget has to ensure that enlargement is a success and that we treat the applicant countries as equal partners and not as second-class cousins. We have to ensure that this is done correctly. We also have to ensure that, within this new format, this debate is meaningful. Let us hope these next few hours give a real chance for dialogue and trialogue between our three institutions. In the pursuit of solutions, it is important to address questions to the institutions, rather than to produce formal set-piece statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start that ball rolling in relation to the amendment from the PPE-DE Group that I mentioned earlier. I will be interested to know how the Commission and the Council would react if we voted through this amendment to give an extra EUR 500 million next year for the rebuilding of Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the presence of the Council and the Commission. I see that both institutions are represented here by a very large staff. I have been allocated five minutes in which to speak. When I look at the budget before us, this means that I can speak for about three seconds on each billion euros of expenditure. That is not very long, so I will have to restrict myself to the main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am pleased that the Council has said – and Mr Terry Wynn has also emphasised – that 2004 is a crucial year. It is the first year of the enlargement and we must do everything we can to make the enlargement a success. Now that the last referendum in the ten new countries has taken place in Latvia, we know for certain that ten new countries will be joining on 1 May next year. We must immediately make them feel at home and that they are welcome. Mr President, you and Mr Böge have been given an important role in working out the budgetary envelopes for the codecision programmes. I think that it is of vital importance that we reach agreement on this before November of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">There are signs of recession all over Europe at the moment. I think that we must try to develop more economic activity. I myself have high expectations of the initiative, which is even mentioned in the directives, to further develop the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector by way of guarantee facilities, via banks in Eastern Europe. If Parliament approves this, I hope that the Council will take a more favourable stance despite its policy of not changing the allocations for the ten new Member States from what was agreed in Copenhagen. This side may submit amendments asking for more attention to be paid to certain developments in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the budget in general. It has already been said once or twice before; we want to be a responsible Parliament when it comes to expenditure. Unnecessary expenditure is something we do not need. As far as I am concerned, we should hold each item of expenditure up to the light to see whether the expense in question is justified or not. Last year’s expenditure pattern will play a particularly important role in this. I think that this is especially important, now that there is strict budgetary discipline in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said once or twice before, but the Iraq question casts a shadow over Heading 4 of the budget. What do we do about Iraq? I think that the Commission must come up with a very clear proposal and must indicate clearly why it thinks a specific amount is necessary and how it intends to finance it. I do not only mean certain amounts that are going directly from the Commission to Iraq. Would the Commission be able to look into what other facilities there may be at some stage? Could there be a role in the long term for the European Investment Bank to encourage businesses to invest in Iraq? Could there be a role for the European Investment Fund and other businesses of this kind? I understand that change is not possible from one day to the next, but perhaps the Commission could make a statement about this. We will have to try to finance this mainly from the 2004 budget, but I think – I do not know – it is going to be close in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">What role does the Commission envisage for the flexibility instrument, and what is realistic in the attempt to reach agreement with the Council? Perhaps the Council can say something about this. One point that affects the whole budget is that it has been customary over the years for Parliament to include certain amounts in the budget for preparatory activities, trials and so on, and that the Commission was then free not to implement them. Other actions that were also proposed in the budget were not financed by the Commission. We want to try to avoid this state of affairs this year. We should therefore put certain amounts of money in the reserve and only release them if we have the impression that the Commission – in other words the budget authority – is taking Parliament’s decisions seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of discussion will also be needed on the Commission’s human resources policy. The Council has announced that it does not agree with the Commission’s proposals regarding additional human resources. Parliament’s position is not yet clear, but it might be possible for us to put specific items in the reserve and only release them once the Commission has met certain conditions. One of the interesting things this year is that this is this Commission’s final year. In this case it is often customary to give various people in the Cabinet of Commissioners attractive positions in the Commission administration, the practice known as ‘parachuting’. We would like the Commission to give us an overview of the promotion policy over the past few years and the plans they have in this area this year.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point; may I say how impressed I am with the good cooperation with the Council, the rapporteurs of the various committees and the Commission itself thus far. I hope that this good cooperation will last until December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as we have heard, the 2004 budget will have some profound changes as a result of the historic enlargement due to take place in May 2004. My objective has been to balance the needs of the institutions so that they can fulfil their tasks and equip themselves to meet the challenges that will be presented by an EU of 25 Member States. At the same time, however, we must ensure that the principles of budgetary rigour and prudence are at the core of all our budgetary decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget will present the other institutions with major challenges, because it will significantly change many of them. Some of the institutions will receive additional 50% increases in their budgets, which will lead to doubling or trebling of the staff within them. This will require sensitive and intensive management to absorb this change seamlessly. Therefore, I would like to start by welcoming the submission of the Third Report of the Secretaries-General on the evolution of Heading 5. This has become a useful tool for the decision-making process, and although we have an annual budgetary procedure, it is important to be aware of the likely multi-annual situation, so that the right strategic choices can be made, for example in buildings and staff policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind everybody that we call upon the Commission and the other institutions that we have this annual report submitted to us by 1 September every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's reading of the 2004 budget has been quite a surprise. I am totally perplexed by the Council's approach: there does not appear to be a clear strategy other than the doubling of the margin. On the one hand, the Council continues to apply an across-the-board approach, of which the Parliament has always been critical. In the past we have said that the Council made horizontal cuts in the institutions without looking into real needs. This has happened again this year on the Commission's budget. On the other hand, however, the Council has been surprisingly generous, to the extent that I have to question whether all requests that it has endorsed are well justified. This year it will be for the Parliament to ensure that the budgetary rigour is applied and a more critical examination of needs is undertaken. Therefore, I would like to ask the President-in-Office's opinion about the approach that I have taken on his decisions. We will be proposing to put money in reserve for two committees - about a million euro for each committee - and to cut back further posts in most of the other budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that the Council has agreed to everything to do with enlargement, and enlargement should have resulted in greater economies of scale. I am a firm supporter of enlargement, but that does not mean that everything that is demanded is required. It is important that we do not have 'carte blanche' as regards enlargement and at the same time reject existing posts and existing staff policy issues - such as upgrading - which are important for the staff who are already working. We need to have a balance here.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to go into detail on all of the Council's decisions, but I do want to ask about buildings, which is the second biggest item of expenditure after staff. I want to understand the Council's strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always agreed on a policy of purchasing the premises of European institutions because it tends to give greater value for money to the European taxpayer, therefore we need to look at building expenditure, taking a multi-annual approach rather than a piecemeal approach, and to try to purchase the buildings as soon as possible. We know that the margin in Heading 5 will be under pressure from 2006 or 2007 onwards. However, we have a considerable margin in 2004. I was disappointed that the Council rejected my proposal to use this to finance buildings to cater for enlargement. This would lead to more savings, including savings for taxpayers. On buildings we do not need piecemeal solutions, we need to take a multi-annual strategic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">My next question is to the Commission. It is about the importance of the adoption of the new Staff Regulation. This issue has been dragging on for some time and it has implications for all institutions and for our staff. However, all the establishment plans in the budget pertain to the old Staff Regulation, so I call on the Commission today to confirm that it will propose an amending budget for the implementation of new Staff Regulations and what the likely timing of this may be, because next year, with the elections, the parliamentary calendar will be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to call upon all the other institutions to take account of some of the changes and demands affecting them in the light of enlargement. They should start planning now and start introducing controls that are absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are jointly preparing the historic 2004 budget – the first for a European Union of twenty-five Member States. All the lights are now green, as the last referendum has also produced a positive result. In most cases, the general public in the accession countries has said a resounding – indeed, a very forceful – ‘yes’ to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, the priority for policy-makers will be the successful launch of common policies in an enlarged Union. Together, we – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have put the conditions in place for this enlarged budget by adapting our financial planning to the needs of enlargement. The budgetary framework for the next three years is therefore fixed and the 2004 draft budget naturally operates within this new framework as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting stability in Europe and encouraging sustainable economic development – these are the further priorities for new initiatives in 2004. They include, for example, immigration policy measures, the new Intelligent Energy for Europe programme, and measures to improve safety in the transport sector. My fellow-Commissioners Mrs de Palacio, Mr Fischler, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino will tell you more in their own contributions about these initiatives and about the specific programmes which have recently been agreed, such as the financial assistance for the closure of nuclear power plants or the assistance with compliance with the Schengen Agreement, which, after all, are new initiatives for the accession countries. Of course, my colleagues will be pleased to answer any questions posed during the course of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s priorities for the budget proposal are in fact very much in line with the priorities set for 2004 by the European Parliament and, indeed, the European Council. It is a good procedure. The method by which priorities are discussed and elaborated jointly at such an early stage has proved its worth. This is undoubtedly one reason, Mr Wynn, why the budgetary procedure is no longer confrontational and has become far more constructive in tone. I would like to convey my thanks to Mr Mulder, the general rapporteur, for his excellent cooperation, as well as to Mrs Gill, the rapporteur, and especially the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn. I would like to thank the other members of the Committee on Budgets and, of course, the other committees’ budget policy experts as well. I would also like to express my gratitude to the President-in-Office of the Council for his cooperation and the swift completion of the budget’s first reading in the Council. As far as it is possible to sum up the most recent budgetary procedures at this stage, I too would like to say that it really is time for the European Parliament to have a stronger role in the budget process, as envisaged, indeed, in the Convention’s draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. I certainly do not share some finance ministers’ fears that it would be contrary to budgetary discipline if this House had the final say on the overall budget. On the contrary, my experience over recent years has shown quite clearly that Parliament fully respects the guidelines on budgetary discipline in its proposals and decisions. The Commission’s preliminary draft budget for 2004 envisages expenditure of EUR 100.7 billion. The increase compared with this year would thus be 3.2%, which demonstrates that all the fears about enlargement being unaffordable were entirely groundless.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, next year’s European public budget ratio will be even lower than this year’s, showing that the necessary scope to fund enlargement has been created in the financial planning process. At the same time, we can be certain that all the new Member States will be net recipients. The fears of some new Member States that they would be net contributors are quite groundless, especially in view of the decisions that have already been taken, as well as the adjustment of the Financial Perspective and the proposals now on the table, which were not challenged by the Council in the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In its first reading, the Council made relatively few changes to the Commission’s preliminary draft budget compared with previous years, and I would like to thank the Council for that. However, there is one point where I must register the Commission’s complete opposition, and that is on the issue of staff increases for the Commission. We face the imminent prospect of enlargement and the accession of ten new Member States with 75 million people, and the Commission must guarantee, from the outset, the full integration of the new Member States by all the means at its disposal. Surely it is obvious that more staff will be needed? My fellow-Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, will take up this issue as well, and Mrs Gill will talk about the budgetary implications of the new Staff Regulations. The Commission has certainly not been extravagant in its demands for new posts. Indeed, we have examined the situation very carefully and calculated very tightly. DG Budget, which is the directorate-general responsible, can be relied on to produce a very accurate calculation in this particular area. The 780 new posts are the minimum required to manage integration. I would like to thank Parliament for its very supportive position. I will of course ensure that all the additional questions and requests for information which you may have at this time are answered in as much detail as you require, for I believe that it is also in Parliament’s interest to ensure that the Commission functions effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In the foreign policy field, we face a new challenge as a result of the situation in Iraq. Next year, we must also launch a strategy for closer cooperation with our new neighbours, but also with the European Union’s old neighbours, as part of a genuine neighbourhood policy. Within the Union, the challenge we face is ensuring a new growth dynamic at a time when the general public also expects more vigorous measures to guarantee internal security. We also intend to push through the successful implementation of our common policies, such as the agricultural policy, in an enlarged Union and help the new Member States make up substantial economic ground. At the same time, we know that the Council is watching to make sure that there is no widening of the gap here. It is everyone’s task to do our utmost to ensure that enlargement is a success, that the Union offers the stability which is sought by old and new Member States alike, and that through sustainable growth, positive living conditions are safeguarded for every citizen of the Union. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it is certainly good, as Mr Wynn said, that we have this kind of generalised debate. We hope it will not be his last time for presenting this report to Parliament as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, but there may be life after 2004. We congratulate the two rapporteurs, as always, but we would like in this particular budget to take a cautious approach to the budget overall. As the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council said, there will be major changes as a result of enlargement, as well as activity-based budgeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have three different Commissioners between May and November 2004. It is going to be a turbulent year. For this reason, my group does not wish to see any opening of the revision of the Financial Perspective over the next 12 months. This would be an unnecessarily complex thing to start at a time when we will be out on election campaigns and the present Commission will be in its last year. We had great problems, in the last legislature in 1999, with negotiating a financial perspective which then tied not only the current Parliament and Commission, but also subsequent ones, to a situation where they could not revise it. It smacks of Soviet-style planning that we should start now to think of what financing will be like in 2013. We, as a group, would like to have a five-year financial perspective negotiated from 2005 to apply from 2006 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to two points in particular. One is Commission reform. Last year we linked the Commission's request for new posts to a comprehensive review on what had happened on Commission reform. It produced a very impressive numerical report. What we would like this year - and we have tabled an amendment to this effect with one or two other points - is to have not only a report about what the Commission has done, but also a report showing what has gone wrong with the reforms and what still needs to be done to ensure that there is proper communication - Eurostat is only one example, though a rather high-profile one. The report also needs to show, quite clearly, where the reforms have not taken place. Is it true that, as Mrs Andreasen stated in a press release today, if the accounting systems had been put in place before, we might not have had this kind of problem? Who knows? We wish to clarify it and to have a document to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point is the question of Iraq. Mr Wynn asked what the purpose of this amendment was. We believe that, at this stage of international development, Europe needs to show that it is not only capable of acting on the world stage and assisting with humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq, but can also put a figure for this item in its budget. This figure pales into insignificance compared with the EUR 30 billion which the President-in-Office of the Council has said has been reimbursed over the last three years from the budget to Member States. A figure of EUR 500 million for next year focused on Iraq would show very clearly Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States and others in bringing that country to the path of prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we wish, as a group, to be able to be principled and responsible in this budget process. We want to ensure that parliamentary priorities will be maintained. All three issues which I raised are ones on which Parliament has the final say. You can expect us to be constant in the process which is now opening out ahead of us to the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be a response to conditions in the Member States. Certainly, this budget is equipped with fewer resources. As a response to what is happening in the Member States, we must undoubtedly say: yes, we must manage the taxpayers’ money prudently, and as the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we will do that. However, we must also set priorities for the budget. That is something which we will certainly do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with an issue which – if Commissioner Schreyer is right, and I hope she is – will fall to us too as a task for the future. Let us talk about the revenue side of the EU budget. The revenue side – that means: where is the money coming from? Who pays? We pay from the taxpayers’ money. As we have observed, some estimates in Europe suggest that as much as twenty billion is being lost as a result of VAT fraud. Anyone who accepts this VAT fraud also accepts the shortfalls in revenue at European level. We are not prepared to accept that – because all these shortfalls must be made good out of the ordinary taxpayer’s pocket. During this budgetary procedure, we will therefore be proposing that the campaign against VAT fraud be stepped up in order to ease the burden on the ordinary taxpayer, so that the money that should be flowing to Europe can actually do so. We will have to debate this issue more often as part of the budget process from now on as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In future budgetary procedures – including the next one – we will ensure that citizens can see for themselves that dependability is guaranteed as one of our fundamental values. This means dependability in combating the economic and social gap, and it means dependability in tackling unemployment. We have heard that the Council has slashed payments for the Structural Funds in particular. This raises a number of questions, in our view. On the one hand, the Member States are registering the substantial amounts of money which they intend to spend in the coming years, and especially next year. Yet at the same time, the Council has agreed, in its draft budget, that spending must be kept below these same figures. We wonder which of these figures is correct. We know that arrears have arisen in respect of commitments undertaken in the past, where payment has not yet taken place. The Council neatly sidesteps this issue and claims: ‘We don’t need the payments.’ We will not get involved in this game. Anyone reaching agreement, after tough negotiations, on the Financial Perspectives, especially in relation to the Structural Funds and therefore structural and economic development in the European Union, must also accept that when it comes to implementation, he will be reminded of his commitments and we will demand payment of the appropriate amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next budget year, we will take care to ensure that the European Union, as an economic area, is not just an economic area for major companies and corporations. We will push for intensive support for SMEs in future too. They are the backbone of the European economy. They are creative, innovative and willing to take risks, and we must give them our support so that even though they have no legal departments and no tax departments, they can benefit from the European Union and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the budgetary procedure, we will ensure that enlargement is shaped on the basis of certainty. There have been various references already to the staffing issue. We will be looking very closely at what staffing levels are actually required in order to ascertain whether every one of the stated vacancies is genuinely needed. However, we will not allow enlargement and the accession countries to become the European Union’s piggy bank. I agree with all the previous speakers here. There must be equality. Decisions like this are the best indicators of whether or not equality genuinely exists. Anyone can voice noble intentions, but it is the decisions themselves that show whether there really is equal treatment, regardless of whether an old or a new Member State is involved. We will monitor this very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas too, we will continue to maintain continuity to some extent, but we will also have to shape our policy in a future-oriented way. This applies especially to foreign policy. Here, it has been our frequent experience in recent years that whenever a crisis situation develops anywhere in the world, we have responded in the heat of the moment and immediately pledged to make additional resources available, sometimes at the expense of established policies. If we look at some parts of the world which we supported in the past, we see that fewer resources are available than in previous years. We have had to restructure. We have done so because we have also recognised, of course, that we cannot increase the funding indefinitely. However, I would like to cite two statistics which, while not relating directly to our budget, do give us food for thought. Today, the United States of America and the countries of the European Union spend 460 billion every year on defence. 460 billion! Yet we spend just 37 billion on development. Is this really a forward-looking policy, one that is aimed at conflict prevention? Is it the kind of policy that developed states should be pursuing? The answer is ‘no’, which is why we want to develop European policy further within the bounds of what is possible – and that is modest enough. We want to work preventively. We want to develop conflict management strategies that will stop such conflicts from occurring in the first place. We are not so naive as to believe that there will be no more conflicts in the world. There will always be conflicts and our region, our Member States, must deal with that. Nonetheless, we will focus more intensively on prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">A further area in which we must work preventively is demographic change. The European continent is changing dramatically. We see that the average population is ageing considerably, not only in individual countries but in all countries. That has an impact on all institutions and agencies. It not only means that there will, in future, be fewer kindergartens, or that we will need fewer kindergartens at local level. It will also have an impact on us. Let me once again give as an example the pensions burden, which we will have to shoulder. In many other areas, too, we will see that the numbers of young people are steadily dwindling and there are more and more older people. We must deal with this situation by shaping it positively. It should be viewed not as a threat but an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists will apply a number of criteria to this budget. The first is financial prudence, because we are dealing with our citizens’ money. The second is dependability. Everyone must see that what we start, we finish, and that we do not drag our feet or drop it half way through. The third is this: we will shape European policies in a way which enables us to work preventively instead of being caught on the hop when situations occur. We will endeavour to monitor developments early on, structure them appropriately and thus shape the European Union, our European continent, so that we have a good and secure future together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Payment appropriations account for just 0.99% of GDP, or, in terms of cash, EUR 11.4 billion below the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s budget has been drawn up as an activity-based budget concerning 31 policy areas. This has long been our group’s clear objective. It will facilitate the monitoring of EU activity. The costs associated with each policy area are clearly visible. Administrative and operational costs are itemised. Efficiency can be more easily assessed, as can the relation between achieved results and money spent. Excessive bureaucracy is a glaring signal of immoderate administrative costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem with EU budgetary policy is outstanding appropriations. Year in, year out, Parliament struggles to adapt the budget to the financial frameworks. In the financial statements we state that arguments over a few euros are totally superfluous when there are billions in outstanding appropriations, easily exceeding as much as EUR 10 billion every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year’s budget will be dominated by the enlargement of the EU. The Council has had a strict view on posts in the Commission that are required for enlargement. It is the opinion of our group that enlargement requires an adequate number of posts but it must not be used as a pretext for swelling the ranks of officialdom. The administrative success of enlargement will depend not only on the creation of posts but also how existing resources can be reallocated and used more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the priorities that Mr Mulder has proposed. We are worried about funding for human rights, as we are too about funding in respect of the International Court of Justice in the Hague. We also hope that the Northern Dimension Action Plan will be taken proper account of in the budget headings. We should also step up cooperation with our new neighbours within the framework of the Wider Europe programme, and the administration of appropriations connected with that should be simplified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union does not seem to have any ambitious plans to support social cohesion between Member States. Many new Member States, or at least their nationals, will be disappointed in their expectations, when there is no manna from heaven for them after all. Differences in standards of living cannot be reduced without money.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is underrepresented in this parliamentary debate. I would have liked to see at least Mr Michel Barnier and Mr Chris Patten here, without in any way meaning to disparage Mrs Michaele Schreyer’s expertise. In relation to next year’s budget I would have liked to hear these Commissioners speak about the Commission’s plans to reduce outstanding commitments on the basis of the ‘sunset clause’. The President-in-Office of the Council had no clear idea regarding a reduction in outstanding commitments. The Commission should have.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group in the cohesion countries would like to clarify on the basis of what condition of the ‘sunset clause’ the outstanding commitments to be cancelled have come about. If they have come about owing to the inaction of the Commission, that is a matter of failing to carry out the will of the budgetary authorities. If they have come about through miscalculations on the part of Member States’ governments, then cutting them is justified. Member States have to obey the rules, and we demand an explanation of how the outstanding commitments have come about.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconstruction aid for Iraq will probably be charged to next year’s budget. We are to have the same sort of division of labour as in Afghanistan. The United States of America, in this case aided by Prime Minister Blair, attacks and destroys, and the EU pays for the reconstruction. Our group takes a very critical view of that. We want instead to use Union finances for the reconstruction of Palestinian targets destroyed by Israel. There has been no oil war going on in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Objects of criticism by many members of our group in the end are the expenditure associated with the common foreign and security policy and the funding of Europe-wide political parties. One feels the EU is pushing for liberalisation of the markets and the development of privatisation, and hence, the neo-liberal ‘made in the USA’ policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my first contribution of the afternoon, I would like to pause, as Mr Virrankoski did, at the implementation of the budget, as the political decisions which we take here with a lot of fuss often falter on that point. Money is shelved, or red tape hinders recipients of subsidies from spending the money properly and effectively. Mr Mulder, the rapporteur for the forthcoming budget, said just now that he wanted the Commission to be encouraged to increase the percentage of the money spent by putting part of the administrative credits in the reserve. Mr Mulder, and also possibly a majority in this House, are not yet convinced that all the items that the Commission asked for before enlargement are really necessary. A Commission official said the following in this regard: you are tying our legs together and still expecting us to be able to run the 100 metres faster.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur’s concerns are legitimate, but I have doubts as to the means. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she can give us her opinion on this. What are the consequences of the reserves? How can you use them in a positive way? Even more importantly, do you think that we are on the right track by spending the money slowly? Up to now we have always put the emphasis on the quantitative side of this. Is it not time we focused more on the qualitative side of the solutions, like Mr Pittella is doing with the structural funds? That means that procedures would have to be simplified, that we would need less paper and more responsible officials.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point with regard to spending the money properly concerns the fact that we often find that projects that are financed with EU resources often do not respect European environmental legislation. What happens when you discover this? Will the money be frozen or will some other more-or-less soft solution be found? One example of this is the bridge over the Tagus River. This was a project financed with EU funds in which the bird and habitat directives were not respected. There are more examples like this. I would like to know what the consequences are if it is discovered that EU-financed projects are violating EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking my committee and its chairman – from whom I have learned so much – the staff of the Secretariat, my fellow Members and the rapporteurs, both for this budget and for the budgets of previous years. As a young Member, I have been able to accrue a great deal of experience in the field, even becoming vice-chairman of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as far as we are concerned, this is a fundamental budget, for it lays the foundations for the future Europe and for the future European Parliament, and I feel that, in political terms, the crucial issue is precisely expenditure for eastward enlargement. In this respect, the budget has the full support of both our committee and all the Members of the House, but only where expenditure related to staff and structures for eastward enlargement are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to focus on what may be a painful aspect of the budget – we must exercise caution when it comes to the appropriations for Iraq. Personally, I have some misgivings about these appropriations: there is a danger that they will grow out of all proportion. Moreover, I would call for there to be close monitoring of these funds, an effective monitoring structure which will prevent reoccurrence of what has already happened with respect to the PNA – the Palestinian National Authority – whose funding is currently being analysed in depth. I would like to flag this point because this kind of monitoring will be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that an experimental phase will be necessary for the new Financial Regulation too. As a wide-ranging, complex instrument, it will inevitably cause mounting tension in the Commission above the level of Director-General, although I hasten to add that I have greatly appreciated the way we have worked together over this recent period.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must mention the initiative that has led to a major debate within our committee: health insurance for Members of Parliament. This is an issue which we will be able to address when we get the results of a study we have commissioned. In this and in all other matters, I would like to wish the Council, in particular, good luck in its work, proud to be able to say that I, too, am an Italian representative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the economic recession, Member States are having to tighten their belts, and the European Union cannot lag behind in this. The Council has made a number of substantial reductions in the draft budget. We do not share the rapporteur’s position of categorically opposing this. Particularly in Heading 2 <span class="bold">–</span> Structural measures, 3 <span class="bold">–</span> Internal policies, and 4 <span class="bold">–</span> External action, we do not consider it necessary to earmark more money than the Council is proposing. We must not close our eyes to the enormous payment arrears in several items of the budget in these headings. The arrears in the structural funds are impossible to explain to voters; they amount to more than EUR 66 billion, two-thirds of the current total EU budget. A Swedish market research bureau came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of the structural policy is clearly not up to the mark. Does the Commission know the results of this survey, and what is it going to do about this persistent problem?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must also look closer to home and check critically whether certain policy sectors do in fact belong at EU level. For example, the fact that some people in this House want to use money for the EU budget for tourism is just one example of something that is preeminently a matter for the Member States. Money for development aid is also going to countries in the southern hemisphere, whilst that is a duty of one or more Member States which have historical connections with these countries. We are of the opinion that the 8.4% increase in the budget for the common foreign and security policy is inadequately explained. The European Union must not set up an organisation in parallel with NATO. That is throwing money away.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 18 million increase in subsidies to the Palestinian Authority is actually unwarranted as long as it refuses to unequivocally condemn and stop terrorist attacks on innocent people. Is the Commission aware of the IMF report, which shows that Arafat had USD 900 million deposited in secret accounts between 1995 and 2000? Finally, the Commission must be more critical when supporting third countries in the Mediterranean region. We must apply the human rights clause consistently in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly support the amendment for a substantial contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq. At the same time we must stress that the extent of this necessary humanitarian aid should not be contingent on political differences of opinion between some Member States and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">My group thinks that it is a bad thing that the reformation of the European Commission will deliver much smaller savings than originally forecast. The difference of EUR 8.8 billion is really very substantial. How does the Commission explain that?</p>
<p class="contents">Where we could also make savings is on the supervisory boards of the agencies in which each Member State has three members. Would it not be excessive if these bodies were to expand to 75 members per agency?</p>
<p class="contents">I must also comment on the management of the budget. It concerns us that expenditure on audits has fallen by 6.4% in the common agricultural policy. This reduction is unwise, given the problems surrounding the management of this policy and the intensity of manpower required for proper control of agricultural expenditure. This spring the European Court of Auditors presented a report on support for the so-called ‘problem areas’. What lessons has the Commission learned from this? Is it, for example, willing to tighten up the vague definition of ‘good agricultural practices’?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, according to the people involved, the fraud at Eurostat is partly related to the limited resources the European Commission releases for proper statistics. Better cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical agencies is certainly to be desired. Eurostat needs more independence for this, so that the impartiality and scientific objectivity of the statistics continues to be ensured. After punishing the fraud and improving administrative control of Eurostat, we need to pay attention to this. What is the Commission’s response to this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although yet another statistic, this is a sign which speaks volumes, the sign of a Europe which is afraid of itself, of its budget and of addressing the problems of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, we welcome the amendment on Iraq, which, at least, sends out a signal, rather than of inconsistency, that Europe does exist, that it wants to do its part and that it has to equip itself to do so. For the time being, it would appear that the budget heading in question is a token entry; subsequently we will do what we can to find the funds to address what is clearly one of the major political challenges before us and which therefore calls, not least in symbolic terms, for an immediate, convincing, substantial appropriation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the Members have highlighted the European Parliament’s priorities. It is important not just to state our priorities but – and I am addressing the Commissioner here – it is important that the Commission acts in accordance with Parliament’s priorities. I am afraid that the impression we often receive is that the priorities established by Parliament are not adhered to. I am not just referring to the EUR 13 billion which we are giving back to the Member States this year; although this does, of course, need mentioning as it reveals a flaw in the system: while this is largely funding earmarked for the Member States, a substantial amount of money has not been spent and a considerable number of priorities, of measures laid down, often together with the Commission, have been carried forward, because of a crisis that we might define as structural. I see this as a major issue, the importance of which must not be underestimated in our assessment of both the current budget and the budget to be adopted for 2004, for the measures actually adopted often fail to be consistent with Parliament’s priorities.</p>

As we all know, the European Union will be taking on more and more new commitments. These relate to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the reconstruction of Iraq, badly governed countries such as Afghanistan and Congo, the enlarged Europe, conflict prevention in the Middle East, and so on. These are important matters and it is also clear that the people are in favour of a more assertive external policy: 67% of Europeans state that they support more European Union in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is crystal clear that the financial limits of the possible commitments will have been reached unless more money is made available. In a few weeks’ time the European Union will be participating in the international donor conference on the reconstruction of Iraq. Mr Patten is suggesting a possible EU contribution of about EUR 200 million in 2003-2004. Others are suggesting an amount of EUR 500 million. Either way, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy does not want this to be at the expense of other geographical zones or commitments, such as Afghanistan, or non-geographical budget lines such as the rapid response concept and landmines. If the European Union wants to assume its share of responsibility for peace and security in the world, it must also be prepared to earmark the necessary financial resources. If not, Europe is at risk of becoming a political dwarf on the international stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we are dealing with activity-based budgeting in this case, I cannot get away from the impression that this split has more to do with the Commission’s internal structure. Funds intended for development cooperation should also fall under this section. Yet we have seen that budget lines for Asia, Latin America and the Middle-East have been placed under the heading ‘External relations’. My committee finds this unacceptable. After all, fighting poverty is the main aim of European development policy. If these budget lines are placed under ‘Foreign relations’, this will be lost from sight.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns our support for the reconstruction in Iraq. Regardless of the amounts mentioned, it must be made clear that this money cannot come from the pot for Heading 4, External action, which is limited as it is. In my opinion the flexibility instrument must be used for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last point I would like to mention is the target percentage of 35% for social infrastructure. The Commission has pointed out that it has achieved this figure in the last few years, but education and healthcare, which are after all two of the very important objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, still come off worst. I would therefore like to call upon the Commission to adhere to what was agreed at the social summit in Copenhagen in 1995. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget lines dealt with by my committee are the most complex of any committee. We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates-general. Because of that complexity, plus the changes in nomenclature, the activity-based budgeting and enlargement, it has been a difficult task to give an overall view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot offer the same praise to the Council of Ministers, because in our committee we have seen a whole succession of very large cuts with no rationale whatsoever provided as to why they should have taken place. I find it impossible to work on that basis. You cannot have a dialogue when one side does not explain its reasoning for what it is doing. There may be some sense behind the suggestions, but it is not at all clear to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take as one example the preparatory action for security research, of enormous interest to the citizens of Europe. Why has that been cut? I am delighted that Mr Mulder is prepared to support us in reinstating the money which was suggested for this action, which many of us on our committee think is important. We want an explanation about Chernobyl. We lay great emphasis on SMEs, as you will see, and I look forward to some sort of rational discussion with the Council about its motivation for making cuts which appear to contradict every policy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore support its main features and have also clearly expressed our support for the amounts proposed by the Commission. I nonetheless wish to make a few comments and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Those measures that are supported within the framework of budget line 02 05 01 (‘Industrial competitiveness policy for the European Union’) – for example, for the purpose of analysing the effect of the information society on competitiveness and of stimulating the development of electronic trade – involve no genuine European added value and should therefore be discontinued. We therefore propose that these appropriations be transferred to budget line 02 02 03 (‘Programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, particularly for SMEs’), where the funds could be of direct use to European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about the problems and irregularities in connection with Eurostat and therefore want the European Parliament to ask for 25% of the appropriations to Eurostat’s administrative expenditure to be placed in Title 31 (‘Reserves’) until the Commission has given Parliament sufficient assurance that the problems have been solved and that the people responsible have been identified and appropriately penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the information campaign concerning the euro and welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed increases in the funding for this. These extra resources will be needed, given that the EU is to acquire ten new Member States that have all undertaken to introduce the euro as soon as possible. We are nonetheless still concerned about the implementation of this budget line in recent years and therefore want again to call upon the Commission to report each quarter to Parliament’s relevant committee on the implementation of the programme in the current year and on the planning for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to call upon the Commission to ensure that additional funds for the information campaign concerning the euro are available if further needs should arise, for example as a consequence of referendums in any of those countries that do not at present have the euro. As an aside, I regret that, following the result of the referendum last week, my own country, Sweden, will not be eligible for funds for the information campaign concerning the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee nonetheless supports the Commission’s draft budget, but with the reservations I have expressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, recent years have already seen the common foreign policy become a priority in the Budget debates, and that will be the case in the 2004 Budget too.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of foreign policy areas in which the EU is involved in common action is reflected in its Budget. Together we have taken on responsibility for rebuilding Kosovo, and for bringing political stability to the Balkan States, and this is reflected in the Budget just as much as is support for the reconstruction work in Afghanistan. The 2004 Budget provides aid for the Balkans to the tune of some EUR 600 million and EUR 184 million for Afghanistan, which, together with other funds, means that the aid we are proposing for Afghanistan amounts to EUR 214 million. I might point out, by the way, that the European Union is doing all that it undertook to do at the donors’ conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that the accusation referred to earlier to the effect that nothing happens for years after the European Union promises aid, is no longer accurate in such sweeping terms. It is here in the area of overseas aid that financial management reform has made a very positive and visible impact. This is one reason why the Commission greatly regrets the way in which the Council has cut the funding for the Commission’s delegations, which play an ever-greater part in implementing the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">A major feature of the 2004 Budget will be the crisis in Iraq and the European Union’s aid for the people there. This year already, the European Union has allocated EUR 100 million from the Community Budget for humanitarian aid. Reference has already frequently been made in this House to the fact that, on 24 October, the donors’ conference on aid for the reconstruction of Iraq will be taking place. Commissioner Patten, who is today attending the UN General Assembly in New York, has made it clear to this House the great relevance of the budgetary constraints to effective aid in Iraq. An independent Trust Fund or a UN agency should guarantee that the aid given by the European Union is multilaterally applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week – on 1 October – the Commission will propose the amount that we intend to pledge at the donors’ conference, that being EUR 200 million. This proposal will provide for funds amounting to EUR 40 million to be mobilised this year, for the margin under heading 4 to be used next year and for the partial mobilisation of the flexibility reserve as well. That, then, will be our proposal for the donors’ conference for up to the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in terms of its size, this promise of aid stands up well to comparison with the EUR 214 million for Afghanistan next year. Our promising EUR 200 million for Iraq has to be seen in context, in that Iraq is less populous than Afghanistan, which is a wretchedly poor country lacking access to income from oil reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also take this opportunity to thank the budgetary authority for approving the support grant for Turkey, estimated at EUR 250 million for next year, and to be paid from the funds for pre-accession strategies; I mention the amount for Turkey only in relation to our aid for Iraq. I believe that these things always have to be seen in comparative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s draft envisages a total of EUR 507 million for humanitarian aid. The Budget sets aside EUR 82 million for the fight against Aids, malaria and other communicable diseases, which have a catastrophic effect on many countries in Africa; this amount will also be used to fund our further donation to the Global Health Fund – that, too, will be the same amount as this year. The reason I mention this is that it figured prominently in this debate last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me announce right now that my fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson and I will, in a few days’ time, be presenting a communication to the effect that, in future – from 2007 onwards, to be precise – resources for the European Development Fund will be incorporated into the normal Budget. Although the priority will still be the fight against poverty, the needs of the ACP States in particular require of us that we adopt a coherent policy approach. The simple fact is, though, that comparisons have revealed that the mechanism for implementing the ordinary Community Budget is much better than that for the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the development policy measures, new resources are being provided specifically for the integration of gender issues into the aid programmes. Overseas aid in particular involves support for many projects particularly targeting the – often dire – situation of women in poor countries and crisis-hit regions. This is described in the reports on the aid programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we need now of course is for these priorities to be accepted by the Committee on Budgets and by Parliament as a whole, with any modifications which the Committee on Budgets may have to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers such as Mr Wynn or Mr Walter have explained very clearly the pressures which have been facing heading 4 of the Budget and the urgent issues which the European Union has had to deal with over recent years. We have had the case of Kosovo, of the Balkans, of East Timor, of Afghanistan and this year we have the problem of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this has been discussed during this debate, I would like to say that my political group believes that the European Union must make a significant contribution to the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq, because we believe that the democratisation of that country must not be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but that it must also fall to the whole of the international democratic community.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament is going to approve a resolution on Iraq which states very clearly, as Mr Van Hecke has quite rightly said, that the action in Iraq must not be funded to the detriment of other areas or other commitments made.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened with great interest to the comments that the Commissioner has just made and I note that the Commission's intentions or forecasts are not going to go as far as that EUR 500 million. I would ask you, Commissioner, whether you intend to consider the complete mobilisation of the flexibility instrument, which was not used last year or this year, and whether you intend to consider other very interesting possibilities such as those referred to by the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, with the incorporation of the candidate countries, there will be lines within the external action of the European Investment Bank which could perhaps be used for that priority. It may perhaps be worth considering that possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the problem we are facing this year with Iraq is a recurrent problem, we cannot live from hand to mouth, we must try to find a permanent solution to the urgent issues which arise in the field of external action and try to mobilise instruments which, in a flexible manner, allow us to assist with these priorities but without, I would insist, prejudicing others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as the President of Romania said this morning, or as the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, said the other day in this Chamber, if our aspiration is for the European Union to play a key role on the international stage, we will have to seek permanent solutions to these problems, because otherwise we will have to be content with being a non-governmental organisation or a kind of international Red Cross which has no other purpose or job than to pay the bill for the great dramas of our times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU will soon have 450 million citizens, and over half of them are women. If women are to take their share in building Europe, information must be targeted at them and they must be involved in specific ways. This parliamentary term has seen us developing our strategy for gender mainstreaming and finding room for it in the Budget process, but its successes are not as evident as they could be, in that women are still generally not visible in the policy areas and we still generally do not see them occupying positions of leadership in the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Women make up only 14% of the observers from the candidate countries, only 17% of the members of the Convention, and only 25% of the Commissioners. Whilst women make up 70% of the staff in category C, not one of Parliament’s Directors-General is a woman. Our resolution on gender mainstreaming proposes a whole range of actions to set benchmarks for the horizontal task of deliberately bringing women into the institutions, such as monitoring the success of leave for educational purposes, retraining, career and personal development, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are now encouraging high expectations of gender budgeting, the implementation of which will mean the professional ‘gendering’ of every committee, every policy area, and every one of the Directorates-General. We need to identify women as a target group when thinking in terms of the visibility of information campaigns, particularly in elections, and that we should involve women in every area of foreign policy – for example, in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq. DAPHNE was a good challenge, and so, of course, are the internal policy areas such as the Structural Funds, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are forest fire prevention, East Timor and economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic fires which have devastated southern Europe, especially Portugal, where 5% of the land area and 11% of woodland has been consumed by flames, makes clear the need to increase assistance for measures to prevent forest fires. Sadly, a retrograde step has been taken in the form of the new Forest Focus programme. In its resolution of 4 September, the European Parliament insisted that the amount of appropriations for the European Union should, within the framework of the draft Forest Focus regulation, be the same as in the previous 1992 regulation on the protection of forests from fires with a view to funding appropriate forest fire prevention measures. We have, therefore, made a proposal suggesting that another EUR 6 million be allocated to the programme and that prevention issues be clearly included in it. We hope this proposal will be approved. I would like to know, nevertheless, whether the Commission agrees with increasing the amounts and including preventive measures in the Forest Focus programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to East Timor: in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission has removed the specific aid line and reduced aid by around 70%. This is unacceptable. We have, therefore, tabled another amendment with a view to restoring the amount of aid to the EUR 25.5 million programmed in 2003. We hope that Parliament will support this amendment, as in the past, but I would also like to know how the Commission can justify this cut, given the discussions held on the budget during 2003 and the various difficulties and areas of instability still existing in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in view of the fact that this draft Community budget is the lowest, in relative terms, since 1987, representing less than 1% of Community gross national income, I would like to know how the principle of economic and social cohesion in the European Union will be safeguarded. I would ask, in particular, how we will fight for social inclusion and employment growth, given that enlargement in 2004 will see the accession of 10 new countries whose average <span class="italic">per capita</span> income is only about 40% of the Community average. As I believe it is impossible to achieve economic and social cohesion with this budget, I would like to ask the Commission whether it wants to abolish economic and social cohesion through future amendments to the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is primarily also an example of the short-term vision of many governments, who seem to be engaged in ‘crisis hopping’. From Kosovo to Serbia – the money transferred along too – and from Afghanistan to Iraq. The Member States will therefore not keep the promises they made at the donor conference for Afghanistan, despite the fact that it is increasingly turning out that these promises were on the low side anyway. I assume that common sense will prevail in this House and that we will fix a higher amount than the Council has in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commissioner another question, this time concerning a different amendment from the one on Afghanistan, namely an amendment from the PPE. They suggest putting an amount aside until they stop growing poppies and start growing legal agricultural products. Is it not true, however, that the aid provided by the EU hardly reaches the remote areas where these poppies are grown? How do you intend solving this problem? I also note that the committees and groups have submitted amendments for external policy which amount to EUR 841 million more than the Commission’s proposals. I would like the Commissioner to tell me how she can explain this discrepancy. Is it true that we simply agree massive amounts, or do you in fact adhere rigidly to the ceiling of the financial forecasts after all, conflicting with the EU’s priorities in the process, because there are many more needs in the area of external policy than you suggest?</p>
<p class="contents">My last question – very brief – is about North Korea. The money for the KEDO project has been frozen and we are doing absolutely nothing else about energy provision there. Is it possible to use the money or part of the money which was previously intended for nuclear energy provision to subsidise alternative energy sources in North Korea? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I would draw your attention to a whole set of amendments on the human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament, we have called – and we have battled for years with success – for our relations with third countries to incorporate a human rights clause imposing – and I do not wish to offend anybody by using that word – mutual respect for the most well-known and most supported agreements in force, the cooperation and aid programmes for emerging countries and, more generally, for countries with which we sustain relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, this clause, formally included in agreements with third countries, is often disregarded by those who should be enforcing it. It is disregarded for various reasons, probably because there is no specific monitoring mechanism in place. However, the fact remains that, very often, we continue blithely to implement our budget on the basis of these agreements – which, as such, must clearly be observed – despite frequent disregard for one of the clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why there are a number of amendments seeking to ensure that the budgetary authority is provided with timely information on the situation as regards the human rights clause, so as to place Parliament in a position to decide, should this prove necessary and in the appropriate manner, to request formally the suspension of the agreements with a country. There are serious, significant cases of systematically violated rights and of countries whose economies depend greatly, if not on European Union aid, certainly on the rich tapestry of relations they sustain with the European Union: I refer to countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia itself, where, as you are aware, the situation is currently very serious and there is a danger of a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> taking place within the next few days, in contempt of the results of elections which Parliament itself declared – maybe rather prematurely – to be perfectly above board.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why I believe it is possible, not least through the lever of the budget, to send a clear signal to the beneficiary countries so as to make the human rights clause a genuine reality and to reassure Parliament, which is one arm of the budgetary authority as well as the promoter of the idea, that the Commission is not implementing the budget as if nothing had happened but is carrying out pre-emptive monitoring. This is one of the most important aspects. I welcome the exchanges on the subject of Iraq, which would appear to be an indication of a desire for constructive dialogue on the issue. I believe that the consideration which I have just illustrated deserves, in all respects, as stated by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the support of the House in the final vote on the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our rapporteur placed the emphasis on the role of the European Union as promoter of human rights in the world. The Group of the Party of European Socialists recommends that all the lines concerning countries benefiting from an association and stability agreement on the Balkans be transferred from the category of ‘external actions’ to that of ‘pre-accession aid’. In addition, we request that realistic appropriations for the Israel-Palestine line be provided, instead of the practice being continued of <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support Amendment No 445 which proposes EUR 47 million for conflict prevention activities – and, in my view, prevention is always less expensive than cure – and Amendment No 118, which proposes EUR 2.5 million by way of additional appropriations for information programmes in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An amendment by Mr Elles proposes establishing a line of EUR 500 million for the reconstruction of Iraq. There are two reasons why this amendment is unacceptable to the PSE Group. While remaining open to the creation of a new budgetary line, we cannot envisage providing funds in the absence of any mandate from the United Nations for the reconstruction of Iraq and in the absence of reliable estimates from the Commission. In our view, it is important that the UN have exclusive control over the reconstruction fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to invite the Commission to inform Parliament regarding the use of the funds in Latin America and to tell us if the considerable increase proposed by a series of amendments is realistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The promises remain, but there is a difficulty in getting actions to follow. That, in the end, is the thought inspired in me by this 2004 budget on development cooperation. I agree, on this matter, with our rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, that any subordination to the external actions heading cannot but accentuate this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, how is one to believe that the objective of eradicating poverty between now and 2015 will be achieved when – and this is only one example – the financial commitments to the Middle Eastern, Latin American, Asian and ACP countries that are the concern of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee<span class="bold"> </span>have not been honoured by the Commission, particularly when it comes to the health and education sectors? One is permitted to have doubts. The sums allocated still offer very little basis for fulfilling the declared wish of achieving the millennium objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">How can approval not be given to any demand made of the Commission to give attention also to the rights of the most vulnerable people and to provide for a specific budgetary line when necessary? I am thinking, for example, of the rights of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Any reduction in, or financial pressure upon, the fundamental elements of Community policy, such as human rights or the duty to give assistance to those who are weakest, would have the effect of sending out a very negative signal indeed to peoples already largely excluded from the march of world progress – victims, no more nor less, of a globalisation that has more in common with the law of the jungle than with growth and the equitable distribution of wealth. Developing countries are waiting for the European Union’s ambitions to change, a fact witnessed to, I think, by the reactions at the last WTO conference in Cancún. As a final word on the subject of development aid, I remain convinced that, without a serious review of the financial perspectives, the pressure upon this heading will become unbearable.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the proposals concerning reconstruction in Iraq, they also call, at any rate in the long term, for an increase in overall resources to avoid the need to draw on the reduced sums for development aid. That being said, I agree with Mr Poos: the announcement of such a financial commitment cannot in any case precede Europe’s indispensable adoption of an independent policy in favour of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and of the role of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the amendments, I approve of those that could favour an annual evaluation of the results and anticipate a joint dialogue between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the methods to be put in place in order to achieve the objectives. In the same spirit and in the interests of genuinely democratic and effective development cooperation, I am in favour of encouraging the widest participation, at all levels, of all those active in civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am going to support my group’s proposal aimed at creating a specific line of aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the territories under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli army’s destruction, to the tune of almost EUR 40 million, of the infrastructure funded by the EU or the Member States was the product of criminal fury. The Palestinian population’s conditions of life have deteriorated considerably during the most recent period. We know that the Commission’s delegation on the ground is doing a remarkable job in difficult conditions. If, however, the EU is to be an active member of the quartet in the manner suggested by the speeches, the EU would do well to accord its budgetary lines as it intends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good opportunity which we Members of the European Parliament are grateful for and take a very positive view of.</p>
<p class="contents">From a general point of view, this is the year in which we should avoid the conflict between national and Community interests. The principles of budgetary austerity in national budgets, which are at the root of the Stability Pact, must be reconciled more than ever with the complete implementation of the Community policies contained in the objectives of the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps we, as Members of the European Parliament, who have the greatest interest in the Stability Pact being complied with and respected. Compliance with it must not be an excuse to interfere in the development of the great areas of expenditure of the Union’s budget, but it must be another incentive to improve its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing our budget with sufficient payment appropriations does not mean failing to comply with the austerity objectives, but to help the European Union’s growth by means of its policies. Otherwise we would be preventing the correct absorption of the leftovers or hindering the efficient implementation of the structural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s best budgetary policy is not one that allows for a high budgetary expenditure, but one which implements the commitments in the Budget well. We would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she agrees with this approach and whether the Commission believes that the level of payment appropriations in the Council’s draft budget is sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, our group has no particular reasons to disagree with the Council on this Budget. We would like, and this will be agreed in the sectoral debate, to go further into certain questions of agricultural or internal policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In external policy we are still seeking a more active role for the Union in the world, because that is also part of the programmed objectives of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This must be seen not only in relation to the strengthening of the common foreign and security policy – both its objectives and its budgetary appropriations – but to particular reconstruction actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of the European Union’s moral commitment to promote peace, security and human rights. We would therefore like to know, Commissioner, whether there is really sufficient room in the budget to be able to take account of the approach taken by the PPE by means of its amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Development and Cooperation is therefore, under the heading ‘Development’, restoring the cooperation lines with Asia and Latin America, which had been diverted to the external relations heading. Development policy is not only directed towards the ACP countries, but towards all developing countries with a view to eradicating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Commissioner, we thank you and we congratulate and support you, as well as Mr Nielson, in relation to the budgeting of the EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our policy for assisting certain groups such as the Saharan people, who for years have been objectively in a situation of humanitarian need, should not be called into question for administrative reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the integration of the gender perspective into the Budget is one of our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the figures, our priorities are the funding of actions to promote children's rights, funds for combating AIDS and malaria, increasing funds for Latin America and the Mediterranean: between the 2000 Budget and the draft 2004 Budget the funds intended for cooperation with these regions have plummeted; they have been reduced by 10.8% for Latin America (EUR 37.2 million) and 16% for MEDA in real terms (EUR 193.9 million), despite the new priorities for these two regions and the summit which is going to take place. Their reflection in the Budget should not conflict with the ceiling corresponding to us, provided that there is no intention to fund any other new action or initiative through development funds.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is for this reason that we are also concerned about the reconstruction of Iraq or any other issue which may arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Poos has evidently not read this amendment, which takes as its reference value the resolution that this House will be adopting tomorrow, it being a minimum precondition for the European Union’s involvement in Iraq that there should be a UN resolution, that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the World Bank and the United Nations, that the Iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation, in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions, all of which are now needed, and, above all, that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the United Nations, in order that it may be a source of funding for the country’s reconstruction. The budget allocation we have proposed is dependent on that condition, and, even if we are talking in terms of one single euro rather than five hundred million of them, it matters that we should get this general concept and these framework conditions right. From that point of view, the Budget today and Parliament’s resolution tomorrow must be seen as very closely interconnected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if this leads us to say that we want to get the United Nations more involved, then we must give more attention to it and to our relations with it overall – and that is what Parliament and the Commission are currently working on. I believe it is tomorrow that the Italian Presidency of the Council is signing, in New York, an agreement on crisis management and crisis prevention, but this needs to be mentioned in the Budget. At present, our programmes for the United Nations are all shared out between a whole load of items in the Budget, without there having been a policy debate to set priorities. As an issue in this House, the subject of the United Nations has been dormant in recent years, and the Commission’s new document gives hope that we will now be defining our relationship with the UN in more political terms, even though the Commission has achieved the masterly feat of producing a document of nearly fifty pages that refers not even once to Parliament and the budgetary authority. I think that any redefinition will also necessitate dialogue between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for a third comment, addressed to the Council. As we do in every Budget procedure, we have put a number of Budget lines in reserve, as the Council still refuses to provide the information agreed on in the November 2002 agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This sometimes seems as if we are battering our heads against the Kremlin wall in the way we used to do. We are sure that we will overcome this obstacle and come to an agreement with the Council that will guarantee the public and Parliament greater transparency in future concerning what is going on in the common foreign and security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to refer to the agriculture chapter, and I would also like to thank Mr Fischler for being here and say to him that, despite the lack of success in Cancún, I am particularly grateful for his defence during these meetings of the interests of European farmers and breeders, of all Europeans and of the whole commercial world.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments proposed to the agriculture chapter are aimed above all, in my view, to the promotion and quality of European products. It is important to bear in mind the amendments I have presented, because one of our fundamental tasks is to protect and defend European products, because their production involves stricter methods with regard to quality and respect for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also promote information in relation to the common agricultural policy. At this moment, when the whole of the common agricultural policy is being changed, it is important that the citizens know what this policy is and, above all, the opportunities it represents for European agriculture and livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">I have placed particular emphasis on the introduction of agricultural insurance systems and I would like this to take place and for it to be reflected in the 2004 Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer to the restoration of funds for the ‘Forest Focus’, for the prevention and combating of fires, because, as we have seen this summer, the absence of prevention and combating of forest fires may lead us into very dramatic environmental situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am glad to see consensus on the need for the conditions to be met. Aid, including that given by the European Union, must be provided under the aegis of the United Nations. The Trust Fund must not be confused with the fund administering the yields from oil deposits, but must be separate from it. I also believe that we can also achieve consensus on other points relating to the conditions. The EUR 200 million proposed by the Commission would also express well our sense of obligation, our awareness of the need for us to take on responsibility, and our willingness to do so together on the basis of the EU Budget. It is also very important that this aid for Iraq should be seen in relation to the shared commitments that we have made in other areas. Let me reiterate that EUR 214 million have been allocated to Afghanistan for next year, thus discharging in full the obligations into which we entered at the donors’ conference in Tokyo. I would also like to again lay stress upon the fact that we are allocating, next year, EUR 250 million as additional aid for Turkey, Iraq’s neighbour, with 65 million inhabitants, and that must also, of course, be seen in its context.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week – on 1 October – we will have the opportunity to debate this in a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, when the Commission will be putting forward a proposal that the margin and also part of the flexibility reserve be used for Iraq, and will be submitting an amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Figueiredo asked about the Forest Focus programme. For this we have allocated the same amount as this year. Both the Regional Development Fund and the Structural Funds can be used for reforestation measures and also for measures to prevent natural disasters. The question has been raised as to whether cohesion policy can be pursued at all successfully using a European Budget amounting to some 0.99 per cent of the Community’s economic product. The answer to that is in the affirmative. The European Budget and its effects demonstrate that our support for cohesion policy is yielding fruit. Last week, I presented what we are calling the ‘allocation report’, which shows who is paying what and where the money goes. The four cohesion countries are the four net recipients from the EU’s Budget, which is only right and proper. The two poorest countries receive the most funds expressed as a percentage of their gross national product, and the cohesion reports do indeed show how successful that is, and that the European Union is successful in its efforts to reduce the economic gaps between one country and another.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg addressed the issue of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation. This year, these funds – which, by the way, your House had blocked – will be reallocated to other purposes, whilst this breach of the agreement means that we have allocated no funds in the preliminary draft Budget for next year. North Korea is not, unfortunately, offering to abandon its atomic programme and to invest instead in renewable forms of energy. This is also relevant to Mr Dell'Alba’s question on the human rights clause. Countries such as North Korea, in which humanitarian emergencies exist at the same time as human rights are being abused, always put us in a very difficult position. Indeed, the Commission had also decided to step up humanitarian aid for North Korea, concentrating this aid on mothers, who are worst affected by the terrible conditions in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did of course bear in mind administrations’ capacity for implementing them when making its proposals relating to Latin America, but we will of course look at Parliament’s various proposals as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, Mr Garriga Polledo asked whether the means of payment cut by the Council are still adequate. As it usually does in October, the Commission will shortly be proposing a revision of the agricultural policy, with new assessments of market developments and taking due account of the exchange rate. We will also be submitting an estimate relating to the old Structural Funds programmes, but I can tell you even now that the Commission cannot accept that the means of payment for pre-accession aid should be cut back. Next year, although the candidate countries will be Member States, they will still be getting help with their pre-accession programmes, as these will still be in progress. It is fortunate that the pre-accession programmes are now at last being better implemented, and this of course means that we need the means to pay for them. We would be very glad if Parliament and the Council together were to restore the former amounts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are particularly pleased that he is here for the budget, but also that he is celebrating his birthday with us. We appreciate that very much.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only support I am giving this Commissioner, as my words will also be critical of the Council and will contain support for the Commission’s policy. For the sake of clarity, much has changed in the budgetary system. Amongst other things, pre-accession aid for the new members has been added to the agricultural budget. What is particularly striking, though, is that the Council has cut the Commission’s original preliminary draft of the budget right down to the bone. For a start, a distinction has again been drawn between the old or existing Member States and the new Member States. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that. A linear reduction has also been made, however, which amounts to a considerable sum in many cases. A linear reduction has been implemented ruthlessly in budget amounts of more than a billion in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say this to the Council: you must realise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development stands four square behind the Commission. It wants the approbations included in the preliminary draft of the budget reinstated. I can understand that the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, wanted to submit a block amendment that includes this. This is also urged in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s report. It would be a good thing if the Council were to realise this, particularly given the fact that next year will be a difficult year; a complete review of our agricultural policy and the accession of new Member States. The Council must therefore realise that it is essential that the Commission be given sufficient financial leeway to implement this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention some of the various items. It is true that we are aiming for a more market-compliant policy, but at the same time the Council wants to make too many cutbacks, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considers unacceptable. To begin with the school market programme; we propose earmarking an additional 10.3 million for this. We also refer to the support for young farmers and for future-oriented and innovative projects. I am referring to the LEADER programme and the SAPARD programme. If it were up to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, there would be an extra 144 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to promotion, control and prevention. With regard to the latter point, I would like to say that we must not allow more cutbacks on the veterinary funds and the emergency funds for animal diseases to be made. We want 30 million extra for these two items. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A main objective was to restore or increase the budgets of the agencies on which we rely to carry out statutory and other tasks set by Parliament, namely those of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, the European Environment Agency and the fledgling European Food Safety Authority. New tasks are continually being delegated to these agencies and it is vital that they are adequately resourced.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, once again we expose the hypocrisy of a European Union that pays lip-service to health promotion by combating smoking-related diseases but continues to pour EUR 1 billion per annum into subsidising the production of low-quality tobacco, much of which is exported to developing countries. How can this be justified?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I turn to CAP reform. European Union and US farmers are subsidy junkies and although the agreement does not spell an end to this transatlantic addiction, it may be a step in the right direction. We applaud moves from direct aid to aid linked to environmental objectives, but we know very well that many environmental directives are not being complied with. For example, the Nitrates Directive, despite being 13 years old, is only being complied with in two Member States. Does Commissioner Fischler foresee individual farmers, regions or Member States having their cheques cut back because of this non-compliance? Are we only paying lip-service to a link between the CAP and a cleaner, better environment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the Commission welcomes these amendments, I would like to remind you that, at the end of October, the Commission will be approving a letter of amendment to the preliminary draft Budget in respect of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, in order to update the resources required. It would certainly be premature to give precise figures for the amendments that we will be proposing, but I am already able to tell you something about the important factors that make these changes necessary. These include, first, the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, which has had consequent effects on certain export refunds or on aid; then, the decision to grant, as early as 2003 – that is to say, in the Budget year 2003 – certain advances against animal premiums for those regions that suffered particularly from the summer drought; and, finally, an agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy, which, however, is expected to have little effect on the Budget for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now return to the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted. The amendment relating to subheading 1b on rural development increases the estimates to such an extent that they would exceed the upper limit in the Financial Perspective by some EUR 100 million. Whilst the Commission shares your view that there is an absolute need to strengthen the second pillar – after all, this is also the general tendency of the modulation agreed on as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, and, moreover, funds will be reallocated from subheading 1a to subheading 1b with effect from 2006 – you will understand that, where the 2004 Budget is concerned, the Commission is unable to go beyond the upper limit in the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to SAPARD and to the introduction of a new Budget line for the funding of a sort of ‘Leader East’, I would like to say that, in the short time available, I see it as neither feasible nor desirable to provide, in the 2004 Budget, for ‘Leader’-type measures in a new preparatory instrument. We are, however, currently examining how SAPARD’s basic rules can be altered in such a way as to do justice to your concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to discuss some of the priorities set by the general rapporteur. Firstly, the resolution on the Budget for 2004 states that funds are to be made available for the further development of opportunities for the use of environmental indicators. In this context, the rapporteur demands that a study be drawn up on how these indicators are worked out. I take a favourable view of this. The second point has to do with the implementation of a preparatory measure to promote the introduction of insurance schemes to cover economic losses resulting from epizootics. As the Commission is very much in favour of a public debate on this issue, to involve all the stakeholders, we are planning for next year a series of consultations and seminars, which will involve all the services and parties affected.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the development of marker vaccines and discriminatory tests for pathogens such as those causing foot and mouth disease or classical swine fever, let me say on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne, that the Commission is working on a directive in this area, which is to create the legal basis for funding to be made available for the development of standard serums.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Commission has approved this directive, there will be an invitation to tender for the manufacture of these standard serums. After evaluation, a decision will then be taken on the manufacture of other serums and the funding that this will require.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the proposal for the examination of systems for the quality assurance and certification of what is termed integrated supply chain management, I am able to assure Mr Mulder that the Commission is in favour of budgeting half a million euros for the purpose of funding new studies and a conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to respond to the accusation that we are continuing to fund the tobacco sector. Let me draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has today decided that we will carry out a reform of the tobacco sector, which will result in these financial resources being completely decoupled. As regards non-compliance, in certain situations, with the nitrates directive, let me point out to you that the Commission has for some time already been taking legal action on this, but this is primarily to do with the way in which the Member States have only partly complied with the requirements of the nitrates directive and have therefore not implemented it. It follows that this cannot be laid at the door of individual farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, finally, like to point out to you that the Council has reduced the number of posts for expenditure connected with enlargement. As you will all be aware, the common agricultural policy will be applicable in the new Member States from the day of their accession, with nothing left out. This makes it absolutely necessary that the Commission should have enough in the way of personnel resources to be able to effectively implement the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now – very briefly – to fisheries and to the report by Mrs Langenhagen, Mr Mulder and Mr Färm, the motion for a resolution in which I can very largely endorse, so that I would now like simply to pick up on only a few of its aspects. As long ago as March, when we had the resolution on the white fish sector, Parliament called on the budgetary authority to draw up a plan for allocating EUR 150 million to compensate for the losses sustained by coastal communities as a consequence of the crisis in white fish stocks. On several occasions, I asked the Member States to tell us how much additional funding they required. With the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark, though, not one Member State reported itself to be in any need. The Commission is therefore unable to put before Parliament any proposal for additional funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the attempt to have scrapping funds funded to the tune of an additional EUR 32 million. That, too, proved unsuccessful, as the Member States did not provide the necessary data. Mr Färm asked why funds could not be reallocated to provide the EUR 32 million, and so I would like to remind him that there is no longer any margin in heading 2, quite apart from which, all funding commitments were finalised right at the beginning of the programme planning period in the national and regional programme planning documents for all four of the Structural Funds. There can therefore be no reallocation before next year’s mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm that we will, in the coming weeks, be submitting a proposal on the Regional Advisory Councils. I agree with the statement in Mrs Langenhagen’s report that fisheries agreements should be endowed with appropriate funding and that their budgets should be as transparent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On fisheries inspections, I am able to inform you that we will, in the weeks to come, propose that the current Regulation on the Member States’ expenditure on inspection work be extended to run until 2005, and provision is made for this in the draft of the 2004 Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As young people’s health is always of very great importance to us, we should be building up the school milk programme, rather than virtually freezing its current funding in the way that the Council has decided. Existing funds will not be enough for ten new Member States, and adequate funding for rural areas and their development, along with assuring the quality of food production, are equally indispensable. This is another area in which money must flow, and it is also important that it should be possible to move from measures to regulate the market to support for rural areas, which, at present a fragile sapling, may thus be enabled to put down strong roots and to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur of the temporary committee on foot and mouth disease, I can see that the enlargement of the European Union means that there must be significantly more investment in the prevention of epizootics. I am glad to hear Commissioner Fischler tell Mr Byrne that more money should find its way into research, as a calamity such as the one we have witnessed in Great Britain must not be allowed to happen again. What I would say in general terms to the Council is that trimming budgets as if you were mowing the lawn serves no useful purpose whatever, for the agricultural budget is not a quarry to be worked for the benefit of this or that other project. The right road ahead does not go by way of across-the-board cuts, and this House wants what was provided for in the Convention’s draft constitution – full powers of codecision and the abolition of the clear-cut dividing line between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. You can be certain that expert decision-making in both the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets would then be guaranteed beyond doubt. Thank you for your attention.</p>

By topping up the funds for this area, the committee has made it clear that it is to this that we attach a higher value and that the cutting back of the market organisations demands that there should be compensation for farms that take themselves to market. We note with concern the evidence that the groups – and, so one gathers, the Commission – are discussing how to use long-term financial planning as a means of trimming this area rather than extending it, or the possibility of putting it under the Structural Funds. Commissioner Fischler, I see the fact that there is now a structural line devoted to ‘rural areas’ as a great triumph on your part. It would be fatal if the forces that want to put things back the way they were were to prevail, as the Structural Funds criteria for rural areas are not very favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">When expressing your view of the ‘Leader East’ issue, you pointed out that you wanted to adjust the SAPARD programme accordingly. We have had this discussion before. I hear what you say, but I lack the faith to believe that the administration will actually put it into practice and that a sensible practice will be the result. A ‘Leader East’ programme should therefore be set up for Bulgaria and Romania, in order to involve the ordinary population in the development of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that it was also with great disquiet that we heard – as we shall shortly do in the committee, when you will give us your comments – that the offer was made to make the Green Box a subject for negotiation. Such a development we really would regard as crazy. If something that is necessary from the point of view of rural development is now to be seen as a subsidy currently laid off and liable to be cut back, then we should discuss that in this House and make our position clear in the next round at the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with most colleagues, I welcome the fact that a series of reforms under the current and past Commissioners have brought agricultural expenditure under control. It is also welcome that the Council agreement in Brussels in October 2002 brought stability and predictability to farmer spending up to 2013. Furthermore, the most recent Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform ensures that payments will shift away from trade-distorting subsidies to payments based on services to society provided by our farmers in areas such as the environment, food safety and animal welfare. I strongly support this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly support the need to maintain export refunds as a crucial stabilising tool within the budget. The amount of money given has been a decreasing portion of farmer spending over the past number of years. Nevertheless, this will remain an essential mechanism for assisting heavily export-dependent sectors to maintain a position in export markets in periods when prices are plunging and markets are uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I welcome the statement from Commissioner Fischler on the proposal to decouple aid for tobacco producers, which will hopefully lead to a reduction in the production of this health-damaging crop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what about the resources that are needed if we are to be able to successfully bring these projects to fruition?</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the Commission’s preliminary draft Budget is rather timid, characterised by willing submission to the Council’s mania for indiscriminate austerity measures. How else is one to imagine the genesis of this PDB, which the Council or – to put it a better way, the functionaries in COREPER – have tightened up? That, let me add, for a year in which the Budget is to be drawn up not for fifteen Member States, but for twenty-five, for which it must be adequate. That, though, is the Council with which we are familiar, ceremoniously signing treaties, but refusing to put its name to the budget appropriations for them. Just do not let the Commission get into the same way of doing things. We know that the ten new Member States’ institutions are in need of a great deal of reconstruction where the protection of the environment, consumer policy and health care are concerned; these are areas in which, despite the funds made available under the pre-accession strategy, they have as yet achieved nothing of any substance. Not only have we learned that from the <span class="italic">Consumers International </span>report, but the Court of Auditors has also enjoined us to take good note of it. Of course we want ‘greening of the budget’, consumer protection as a mainstreaming principle in all European policies, and awareness at every level of Europe, but, to do that, we need operational resources and resources in terms of personnel, and these have to be made available. That will not be done only by pithy strategies or action programmes written down on paper – which, of course, does not blush! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say to the Commissioner that he, as Commissioner, and the Commission itself, has promoted a reform of the CFP of a highly destructive nature, scrapping fleets, and that the Commissioner for budgets should perhaps tell us now how much additional funding is going to be allocated by the Commission to pay for this policy of scrapping.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I would like to focus on is the fisheries agreements. The new ones: Tanzania, Kenya, Libya, etc. for which additional funds will be needed, and the old ones, for which the Committee on Fisheries maintains its former demand that the part corresponding to compensation for fishing opportunities be separated in this budget line from the part corresponding to development cooperation with third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For a start, I believe that we are, in principle, in entire agreement where the issue of rural development is concerned, but we must, on the other hand, all abide by the boundaries set by the Financial Perspective. As regards what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly described as a long drawn-out debate on additional measures in connection with a sort of ‘Leader East’, I do not know if I can now, so to speak, convert him, as he has said he lacks the faith, but I am quite serious in saying …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... that we will rearrange the basic regulation in such a way as to do justice to your concern. Taking up your suggestion that we should discuss the things that were said in Cancún about the Green Box, I really would greatly welcome a discussion of this sort, which we could perhaps extend by inviting various representatives of NGOs to join in. I did in fact get the impression from Cancún that this is where what one might term the sustainability department and the development department in some of the NGOs sometimes put forward quite contrary points of view, and I believe that this is something we should really hammer out together.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already indicated that the Commission can make a proposal on fisheries policy only if the Member States are willing to give us the necessary figures. Their needs are obviously not that great, or else they would have provided the figures. I am not, therefore able to say at present how much of the Budget is to be allocated additionally to the scrapping policy; my only guide is what we have actually been told is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are meant to – and we will – draw a distinction between the development component and that element in which we pay for the acquisition of fisheries rights under an agreement, but no new subheadings are needed for this in the Budget; it can be quite sensibly organised within one Budget line, and that is what we are going to do. You will very soon find your requests being complied with in the proposals that we are going to submit.</p>

<p class="contents">Following the normal practice within my committee, this year I have used the matters that we found during our discharge procedure to draw some budgetary amendments to get what the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to see from the Commission and other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It breaks down into three different areas, two are related and will be touched on later, and the other is the Committee of the Regions. We have yet to grant discharge to this committee for the 2001 set of accounts and, as more revelations appear about the state of its accounts and what has been going on within that committee, it is highly unlikely that we will do so. Therefore we have tabled an amendment asking for 25% of members' allowances within the Committee of the Regions to go into the reserve until the rapporteur provides us with much of the information we have requested.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point concerns Eurostat and OLAF. We have tabled an amendment asking for a significant sum of money to be placed in the reserve for OLAF. This achieved near-unanimity in the committee, because we have been unhappy with the way OLAF has been reporting to the budgetary authority, in many cases contravening its own rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to Eurostat. We are very concerned about some of its activities and the way in which the Commission is dealing with it. We have tabled a number of amendments and, when it comes to the main budget debate, more amendments - that we shall be pushing on behalf of our committee - may be tabled by the political groups, because it is about time that someone took responsibility for the problems within Eurostat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means – no more and no less – is that the Commission’s preliminary draft does not include any structural improvements in the conditions under which the European justice system functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we went no further than doing this, and I would like to urge the Committee on Budgets not to reduce this still further, for, if we allocate only the funding relating to enlargement, and not the funds for the additional tasks, the situation cannot fail to deteriorate still further. The Committee on Budgets will have to decide whether to take sides with the Council or with the Commission and the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to address has to do with the Academy of European Law, the work of which, over the past ten years, has met with immense success. Its founding members, Germany and Luxembourg, have since been joined by Ireland, Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden. Finland has announced its intention of joining.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past ten years, a total of 38 000 people from the European Union and the new countries have taken part in seminars and training courses. The Academy of European Law has, in that time, become the secretariat of the European Judicial Training Network, and it will, in future, be particularly involved in promoting cooperation between judges in Eastern Europe. All this justifies a commensurate increase in the grants to the Academy of European Law under the financial programme, not only for 2004, but thereafter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Rothley did this without any pre-arrangement or knowledge, and, I guess, by extra-sensory perception.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know and as my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has said, the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy for 2004 has identified three policy areas as priorities, namely enlargement, stability and sustainable growth. We also made it clear that on the second and third of those priorities the work is to be staffed by internal redeployment of Commission personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also decided that in the further implementation of reform, the redeployment of resources should be accomplished with the assistance of the time-and-numbers-limited voluntary early retirement scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of enlargement, we recognised the reality that new human resources - new posts - were needed in order to meet the fresh and very substantial demands arising from the historic change. The rationale for the proposed increase is very straightforward: the accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004 will bring a 66% increase in the number of Member States, a 20% increase in the population of the Union and an 82% increase in working languages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will handle the very diverse and substantive new demands with just 13% more staff: 3900 extra qualified people recruited over a transition period of five years from the beginning of 2004 through to the end of 2008. For 2004 - enlargement year - after 500 deployments of existing personnel within and between existing services, the net addition needed is 780 new posts.</p>
<p class="contents">To establish this figure, all current tasks performed by Commission services were classified on the basis of 'activity-based management'. Calculations were strictly based on the additional workload that we know will have to be borne by the Commission as a direct result of enlargement. This systematic approach was applied across all services and the information provided was then carefully screened for extra certainty. In short, we based our request for additional human resources on a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of real and proven operational needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that representatives of the Council are here. I thank them for their courtesy in attending this debate, but I have to say candidly that, against this background, the cut of 272 posts proposed by Council in its judgment on the provisional draft budget is unwelcome and, in the light of enlargement, unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is vital for this Parliament to be made aware of the sombre reality that providing less than the 780 enlargement-related posts which we have proposed as essential for 2004 would have a major and very negative effect on the Commission's ability to manage the fresh task arising directly from the accession of ten new Member States which, universally and unanimously in Commission, Parliament and Council, we strongly advocate and stoutly support.</p>
<p class="contents">In making our proposal we were not seeking to grab posts. We were simply being realistic about what has to be done in and for a bigger Union. I am therefore pleased to see the horizontal amendment - Amendment No 3053 - tabled by Mr Mulder, which would facilitate the re-establishment of the number of posts requested. However, the fact that those posts would be in the reserve would produce significant practical problems. By definition, it would mean that the new posts would be made available to the services later, thereby further delaying the recruitment process. In the meantime, the resulting uncertainty and delay would seriously inhibit proper fulfilment of the tasks of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it clear to the House that the list of criteria given by Mr Mulder in his Amendment No 3053 is realistic, but those criteria could usefully be clarified further. For instance, concerning the second criterion, I want it to be plainly evident that the proposed recruitment figures will enable the Commission to ensure geographical balance across the institution after enlargement. That is fundamental. In any case we want to avoid the addition of any further criteria which the Commission could not, frankly, feasibly meet in time for the second reading in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has manifestly shown great care and deliberation in calculating needs. The minimum necessary number has been proposed. No-one in this House appears to be motivated by any intention to destabilise the already demanding processes of fulfilling the tasks arising from enlargement. When all of those facts are self-evident, I hope that there will be further reflection on the proposal to put posts in the reserve with all that implies in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The House is also considering amendments which seek to make changes to the establishment plan. Amendment No 3502 proposes to reduce administrative and staffing costs by 10% in a number of policy areas and to place that 10% in the reserve with the aim of fostering the operational part of the programmes. I am bound to say that this would lead to a substantial delay in future recruitments. While I understand the political intention behind this amendment and realise that it is consistent with similar amendments in previous years, the Commission will have great difficulty in trying to fulfil the relevant programmes effectively without the appropriate level of administrative resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to tell Members who have been involved in efforts to introduce activity-based budgeting and greater transparency that we are not debating a technical matter. The Commission's responsibility for allocating resources to activities and for accounting for those allocations is a profoundly political issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As the internal allocation of human resources is decided, the Commission will give proper consideration to the concerns expressed by this Parliament in its budgetary resolution. But, for the sake of effective operation and responsibility, the administrative autonomy of our institutions must be maintained. That means that the conclusive decisions on establishment plans must, in the final analysis, continue to be for the Commission to make on the basis of properly calculated and manifest needs. I know that many Members will recognise the principle and its practicality. I have huge respect for the many qualities of Mr Mulder, but he is pre-eminently a practical man. I hope that those considerations will recommend themselves to him. I only give praise where it is due ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... lavishly to Mr Mulder, but nevertheless, when it is due.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the cuts relating to the appropriations for posts, the Council has made a number of other cuts in the administrative budget of the Commission relating to delegations, auxiliaries, missions, meetings and representation offices. Faced with that I want to be absolutely clear: cutting the budget of our delegation offices would damage the last phase of the deconcentration, which is a process strongly favoured by this House and by the Commission. The proposed reduction on missions, meetings and representation offices will also inevitably have a negative impact on the enlargement process. The Commission needs the preliminary draft budget to be re-established in order to meet the administrative challenges of 2004 arising inevitably and foreseeably from enlargement. Expenditure in that area is neither excessive nor decorative. It is absolutely essential to good performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Also essential to good performance is the continuation of the normal transformation of posts needed for career development. If, as the Council had proposed, the transition to the new career structure - strongly and rightly supported by this House and indeed by the Council - was to be accompanied by the withholding of conventional patterns of promotion, the effect would understandably be confusing and demoralising for the staff of the European public service. However, I understand that the rapporteur proposes tabling an amendment to re-establish this routine practice. That would be a most welcome proposal and one that would give a reassuring and strongly cooperative signal to our staff, whose active and confident engagement in modernising change continues to be absolutely vital, as it always will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that Commissioners should assume their responsibilities and be given the means to do so.

They create a basis for the clarification of personal accountability, taking responsibility and the creation of activity-based budgeting and management.</p>
<p class="contents">This budget is in fact the first activity-based budget. How to improve activity-based management is a continual challenge. The objective must be that the different policy areas be given room for manoeuvre in creating the most efficient administrative structure possible. This means that in the future we can very likely abandon the practice where Parliament decides separately on the establishment of a post or changes to it. Parliament will only decide how much money is available in a particular administrative area. This may then itself decide on the creation of the most appropriate administrative structure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, defining and bearing personal responsibility will be of key importance, because activity-based budgeting and management lead to the downward delegation of power of decision. As regards financial management, we have to be able to establish exactly what we require of the careful management of finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Different organisations and NGOs make up their own areas of specialisation, which the European Parliament has given its support to. These ‘earmarked’ A-30 budget lines have been the budget’s bugbear. To be honest, access to them on the part of organisations has been on an arbitrary basis. Often the European dimension to these organisations has not been any better off than that of hundreds of other organisations that have been operating without support. Now a legal basis is being established for the system and the question of assistance is to be for the Commission to decide. This measure must be implemented as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you took up your new responsibility in 1999, you promised to create the most modern and most efficient administration in the world. Now you are trying to get us to buy the idea that, as your term of office in this Commission draws to a close, you have actually achieved this exalted objective, but, Commissioner, things in the garden are not quite as rosy as the glowing colours in which you have depicted them would suggest. There are many dark clouds overshadowing it, and a number of points that I would like to take up.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it is, in my view, unacceptable that the Commission’s administration does not reflect what the budgetary authority wants. I am glad to see that Commissioner Vitorino has now arrived; we discussed this under the heading of information policy this morning. We have topped up the funds for this, leaving nothing in the reserves, but, at ground level, there is no administration and the decentralisation to which you referred does not work either. Agreements with the Member States are not concluded and there are no funds for things – like the outcome of the Convention – in which the Commission has no political interest. You have EUR 10 million at your disposal, and only EUR 1.5 million have been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not your job to decide for yourself how the Budget is to be administered, but to ensure that the administration actually carries out what the Council and Parliament have decided. You are failing to do so, and, as Commissioner for personnel, you share the responsibility for that. I could give you many other examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is also about those areas in which the Commission itself bears financial responsibility. The excuse is always given that it is the dastardly Member States who administer 80% of the budget, but, where you yourself are responsible, you have to maintain order and, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have given you the clear message as regards the way you do that: that is your responsibility and you have to answer for it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I am grateful for the kind remarks by Mr Casaca because they are based on very thorough analysis of everything we are seeking to do. I wish that was a universal characteristic, but I find that some people writing in the press, for instance, have a confidence and an assertiveness in what they write, which is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge that they have.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret his understandable view that the Commission, to use his term, is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament. I understand the force of what he says when he reminds us again that the internal audit activity, the examination of contracts, was a direct product of the discharge resolution drafted, in fact, by Mr Casaca himself and some of his close colleagues. I fully recognise the force with which he puts the point. I only say this: we are having to use the Annex III procedure for a very basic reason which I am sure will be understood.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to observe strict confidentiality whilst trying to maximise information to the people who are most entitled to know, including Members of this House, simply because those reports which are now being completed contain a potential for disciplinary and even more grave procedures. That is not an excuse, it is not an evasion. It arises from the proper observance of the rights of natural justice and the presumption of innocence, and also from our strong desire not in a precipitate fashion to release details into the public domain which could then compromise the integrity of a case or cases we may wish to bring against individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that on examination it will be understood that I say this in a mood of explanation and transparency, not apology or evasiveness, and it is necessary simply because of the material we are dealing with. I realise that if there had been a historic background of trying to keep confidentiality to a minimum, and transparency to a maximum, then it would be easier for this House to understand that, when it is critically essential that we use confidential procedures, it is done for absolutely the best reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, amongst other products of activity-based management and budgeting and the transparency that Mr Virrankoski spoke about, we will see a further evolution of the readiness of the Commission to make maximum disclosure whilst trying to safeguard the integrity of necessary procedures. The report will be available under Annex III of the framework agreement procedure when it is ready. It is being finalised literally now, so that it can be available in the proper form at the time promised.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the consolidation of political responsibility I do not yet envisage the full implementation of the architecture that Mr Casaca desires, though I have a lot of sympathy for it. That architecture consists in the establishment of a full financial control unit, as it were, in the office of every Commissioner. But I consider that we have made substantial progress towards achieving that, on the one hand in the general ambit of the Financial Regulation, but more specifically in the reforms adopted by the Commission, in some cases as recently as July 2003. Those guarantee an absolute requirement for reporting on management conduct and financial operation in a DG at least twice a year, specifically to the responsible Commissioner, so that Commissioners will in future continue to be <span class="italic">au fait</span> with the practical operational management of the directorate-general, as well as bearing their straightforward and obvious political responsibilities. It will not diminish political responsibility, portfolio responsibility or policy engagement: it is likely to add to those. Commissioner Schreyer and I sent a letter to all DGs in July 2003. The response we got from the DGs - with very thorough analysis seeking to detect any practices remotely related to what we have observed in Eurostat - was rigorous and encouragingly thorough. I know that Mr Casaca, with his interest in these matters, and probably Mr Mulder, will want to examine that. That will be very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Virrankoski obviously shows great understanding and I know his background really gives him an authority in this area. I would simply say to him that I agree with his forecast for future structures and the practices that he anticipates, and express confidence that they will come to pass. Culture in an organisation of human beings is substantially a product not of ethnic or national origin or regional origin or language. Culture is a product of the systems and structures in which people work. By making massive reforms that radically change systems and structures, we foster the kind of culture of transparency and accountability which is fundamental to the successful operation of activity-based management and of the activity-based budgeting which reinforces that process.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Ferber I would say: it is a matter of record that my promise at the outset of the Commission - and I am not trying to denounce or go back on any catchphrases about the best in the world, etc. - was that we would strive to achieve, through radical modernising reform, a well managed, high-performance, service-orientated, independent European Commission in the service of the peoples of the European Union. I do not think that was modest, and yet we are accomplishing it. To use his phrase, I do not imagine that the sky is as blue as he says I have painted it. We acknowledge in our frequent progress reports the shortcomings, the target dates that we have missed, as well as the ones that we have bettered. We acknowledge where further development needs to take place. It was, after all, this Commission which - as soon as we had prima facie evidence that gave us legal security in undertaking certain actions - suspended contracts, opened disciplinary proceedings, established the strongest, biggest ever inquiry task force in the history of the Commission, increased the staffing of the internal audit examination of contracts from 9 to 24 persons and has had those reports coming in absolutely on schedule. This is not evidence of a slothful or lax Commission, but neither does it mean that we imagine that the sky is permanently blue, nor do these glasses have any rose tint. I am impatient for further change. I want to see total implementation. That ambition is shared universally by my colleagues and we could not have made the progress we have unless we had had massive cooperation from staff assuming these obligations in addition to their normal workload and if we had not had the full-hearted commitment of every single Member of the College of Commissioners. Therefore, I do not try to pretend that we have done more than we have. I simply ask for a factual examination of what has been achieved. For instance, automatic mandatory mobility for senior management and for people in money-handling, contract-handling posts will in itself provide a safeguard against a repetition of the double accounting that we have detected in Eurostat. More than any other measure, but in addition, reforms of structures and systems of audit control and management control that give us - insofar as any human organisation handling money can get it - real, strong safeguards against any form of repetition of what we have detected and are acting upon now.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the response to Parliament and the Council is concerned, I respect it. I come from a parliamentary tradition where an elected House of Commons obtained its strength by having the vote on the budget. Therefore I fundamentally respect and want to endorse that democratic procedure. I do not plead for us to depart from that. I do not make an argument for being insulated against the representations and judgment of Parliament or of the Council which represents the taxpayers. I do not ask for that for one second. I simply say that it is a practical reality that, without autonomy, it is difficult to exercise responsibility, and when we have autonomy our responsibility must be fully accountable. However, if we do not have the resources or the people whose presence, qualities and qualifications we can totally justify, then it is very difficult to see how the Commission can undertake the tasks it has now, let alone the ones that are to come as a consequence of this glorious enlargement, but which nevertheless we recognise to be additional obligations which we must discharge with efficiency and honesty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a constructive dialogue, this House’s specialists in social policy have made a package of these objectives and adopted them by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Our priorities include industrial safety, by which I mean that our agencies should be adequately equipped and enabled, above all, to press on with the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and also micro-businesses, something that is especially necessary in the candidate countries. We also seek a moderate increase in funding for the Community initiative EQUAL and for non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community initiative EQUAL is a specific instrument, within the framework of the European Social Fund, for realising our ideas and achieving our objectives, which are also those of the Lisbon process. We have to make progress towards these goals, and to do so, we have to guarantee that the initiative is endowed with the necessary funding. We need more jobs – sustainable jobs – and we also want to promote training – training with qualifications – and strengthen its role in the Member States, while at the same time offering businesses incentives to discharge their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as there is any change, we will keep on criticising the flow of funds from the European Social Fund, which, this time round, is still a scandal – not one attributable to Parliament or the Commission, but, we believe, one for which the Member States bear responsibility. This is something that we want to change in the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds, rather than taking action in the course of this Budget. Our political vision is of course not just about making enlargement a reality, but primarily about the creation of a social Europe, which is where we still have a lot of catching-up to do in amidst the other tasks that Europe has to accomplish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the perspectives and priorities of the European Parliament, notably in the framework of the Prince programme. We talked about the subject this morning in the course of the meeting on the issue of interinstitutional information, and we are very concerned about the non-implementation of a fair portion of the appropriations made to the priorities that Parliament recommends, has already recommended and will again recommend for next year. I would appeal to the Commission to place this non-implementation at the heart of its concerns. Commissioner Barnier is well aware of the matter. I think that we are in a decisive year for the integration of Europe and for the image of Europe. The Constitution will, we hope, be adopted, and the elections are approaching. The credits in question must, therefore, be implemented and put to good use.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the first chapter of the amendments by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. There then follows another chapter of amendments that I would call ‘image of the institutions’. We would put forward the idea, which we would ask the general rapporteur also to support, that the Internet should become the tool by which Europeans can really take an interest in, and get up to date with, what is happening in Europe. I am thinking not only of the written Internet, which obviously makes a lot of things possible already, but also of the broadcasting of debates such as the budgetary debate, the committee debates, the public meetings of the Council, when these take place, and the daily conferences of the European Commission. We think that this tool, which is actually very cheap to use, really can enable people to keep up to date with what is happening in the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before mentioning three points, I would like to say to Mrs Weiler that I have noted the perspectives that she outlined, which have in fact more to do with future regional policy, its appraisal and how that regional policy and cohesion policy can be made to serve the Lisbon or Göteborg objectives. That is precisely what the college is discussing at the moment in preparation for future financial perspectives and for the content and proposals of the third cohesion report. Thank you very much for the impetus you have given.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would, therefore, like to mention three points:</p>
<p class="contents"> the 2000-2006 programmes,</p>
<p class="contents"> the closure for the period 1994-1999, and</p>
<p class="contents"> the structural policy consequences of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that the 2000-2006 programmes are honestly making up lost time. This is the fruit of the simplifications we have proposed and undertaken with the Member States. The payments for 2000-2006 were made more quickly than before. At the end of August, we had already paid 25% more than at the same time in 2002. For the first time, the 2000-2006 payments could even be higher than forecast and I anticipate asking for at least EUR 1 billion more in objective 1 appropriations when the overall end-of-year transfer is made. We can also see here the effect of the n+2 rule about which we alerted ministers on 22 April last, as I informed your committees. Between 1 January and 1 September, the governments reduced the backlog of payment appropriations that had to be dealt with in order to avoid decommitments. To avoid any decommitment, I am also going to write to every government again and they will have to present us with another 5 billion in payments by the end of the year. If their forecasts are to be believed, it will be done, but, ladies and gentlemen, to be perfectly honest I no longer give much credence to Member States’ forecasts when I get them. Having said that, Italy, which has got us used to miracles, accounts for 40% of the effort that still has to be made. Three states alone account for 80% of the remaining effort. Conversely, in Austria, Spain and Greece the risk is very low and there is therefore nothing inevitable about it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the 1994-1999 closure. This is a difficult point, as I have often said in this House. This closure will in fact be longer than expected. It was only on 31 March last that the Commission received virtually all of the some 2 000 files to be closed for these 1994-1999 programmes. I want the necessary checks to be made and any corrections that may be necessary as a result of those checks to be completed. I do not therefore want to rush the closure of those programmes. In view of the time required to guarantee the quality of the checks and the consultations that the procedures require, ladies and gentlemen, despite the best efforts of my services and those of the Commission we shall be unable to pay all the appropriations earmarked for 1994-1999 in 2003. That is the main reason for the delays just highlighted by Mr van Dam. There is therefore a risk of under-implementation in 2003 of at least EUR 5 billion for the Structural Funds as a whole. As soon as I had identified this risk in July, I alerted my colleague Commissioner Michaele Schreyer. Together, we will shortly be proposing that the Commission submit a draft amending budget to the budgetary authority in order to cancel without delay the appropriations that would be unused. The actual amount that will have to be cancelled still needs to be clarified by Commissioner Schreyer’s services, they being the only ones with an overall picture of the budget, in order to identify any needs that will have to be covered under other budget headings between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I confirm my commitment to reducing the amount remaining to be settled in two ways: firstly by cancelling commitments not covered by a request for payment, for example when the project has been abandoned or cost less than expected (in this connection, decommitments are already being prepared; they will represent at least EUR 1.5 billion for the European Regional Development fund (ERDF) alone) and, secondly, by making as many payments as possible where the dossiers are now in order. Between payments and decommitments, I confirm that I have set myself the target of cutting by at least half what remains to be settled for 1994-1999 for the ERDF in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I think these few explanations on this point will satisfy Mr Seppänen’s request. The flaw in the 1994-1999 management was precisely the lack, Mr Seppänen, of what you called a <span class="italic">sunset clause</span>. We now have one with the new n+2 rule and it is starting to bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is the structural-policy consequences of enlargement. The success of this enlargement, taking in 10 new Member States, is the Commission’s top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy is also a top priority. The big challenge facing us is to complete negotiations with all the new Member States before the end of 2003 on the programmes that will have to be operational in a few months’ time for the very short period 2004-2006. Enlargement is therefore already part of the everyday lives of our directorates-general responsible for the Structural Funds and your constant support – which I will still need for the crucial period ahead – has enabled me to anticipate the Commission’s commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the budgetary effects of this enlargement? For commitment appropriations, for the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, in addition to the 34 billion provided for the present Member States, an additional EUR 6.7 billion is earmarked for the new Member States. That is an increase of around 20%. In terms of human resources, the number of posts requested to guarantee the success of this enlargement is, it seems to me, modest. If you accede to the Commission’s requests, the directorates-general concerned will increase their staff by only 7% to manage a 20% increase in appropriations. This increase in our administrative capacity is a minimum because these countries are not yet used to Community programmes. They will therefore need more support, more advice, and more controls, too, than the present members. That is my objective answer to Mrs Gill’s comment that she would like us to make economies of scale. Quite honestly, a mission to Poland cannot be combined with a mission to Spain. However that may be, I thank you for your support in obtaining the human resources essential for guaranteeing the success of our cohesion policy in 2004 and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, what are the consequences of all this for the payment appropriations needed for 2004? So far as enlargement is concerned, it is not really an issue. As was decided in Copenhagen, payment appropriations for the new Member States in 2004 have been confined to advances. For the 2000-2006 programmes, your rapporteur, Mr Mulder, suggests increasing payment appropriations by 3 billion. If Member States’ forecasts are to be believed, that will be necessary. It is true that if the Member States manage to avoid any decommitment under the n+2 rule, we would then need an extra 1 billion for the ERDF alone. As you see, the Commission has adopted a prudent and realistic approach in the light of the implementation of earlier years. I think some decommitments under the n+2 rule will be unavoidable in 2004. We will also have to get used to including them in our forecasts. If the payment appropriations turned out to be insufficient for the 2000-2006 Structural Funds and for closing the 1994-1999 period, the Commission would then ask for an additional amending budget during the 2004 financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the 1994-1999 programmes it is clear that we will need appropriations in 2004 to complete the closure beyond the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. I cannot yet say how much those appropriations will amount to. The checks currently being made will certainly result in reductions in the amounts to pay, either by excluding amounts which are not legitimate or by applying financial corrections. Over all, on the basis of the information I have available, an increase in heading 2 payment appropriations would not be illegitimate while not perhaps going as far as Mr Mulder suggests. At this stage, however, I would prefer to confront the Member States with their responsibilities and get them in the end to make realistic forecasts, even if that means increasing the appropriations under management in an amending budget when we have all the data.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Dell'Alba, we have had a very important dialogue and, like my colleague Mr Vitorino this morning, I have paid great attention to it. I can confirm that of the 12 million available this year for information on the great debate on the future of Europe, 8.3 million are in the process of being or have already been committed. There are 3.7 million remaining, which can be redeployed. Like Mr Vitorino, I will endeavour to propose a use for this money by the end of the year, perhaps in partnership with Parliament, for an information campaign or to compile documents that will help to explain the outcome of the Convention and, I hope, the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, but also to show how this new institutional architecture we are going to have can be useful for specific policies to benefit the citizens. We are thinking of a new document – we discussed it with some parliamentary officials this morning – that could be made available to Members of Parliament and European election candidates to show specifically what this new Constitution consists of and how it can be useful for specific policies to benefit the citizens. That is the information I wanted to give you on this specific point that Mr Dell'Alba raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a delay in closing dossiers, the basic responsibility for which lies with the Member States, which are late submitting all the information required or, in all events, when they do submit it, do not submit it in the proper form. That is why there are funds which have not yet been paid to the Member States and that is creating a problem both with the Community budget and, of course, with the national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, there are more positive developments in the new programming period from 2000 to 2006, although here too, of course, we must be very, very careful. I noted with satisfaction that this year we are doing better than last year from the point of view of the take-up of appropriations and trust that the n+2 rule, despite the criticism it sometimes receives, even here in Parliament, is a rule which will result in proper management on the part of the Member States as regards programming and managing the sums of money. Besides, we should not forget that it was the Member States themselves which, in unanimously adopting the current Structural Fund regulations, came to accept this n+2 rule.</p>
<p class="contents">These, broadly speaking, are also the reasons why, in our committee at least, we propose to return essentially to the preliminary draft budget initially submitted by the Commission as far as category II of the budget is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other matters are concerned, I should like to comment in particular on the trans-European networks and to say that, even after the van Miert report of 30 June this year, and pending the proposal to reform the trans-European networks, our committee wishes to note their importance and to stress that words and deeds must coincide at some point. If we want to promote the trans-European networks, we need to find ways of funding them and one of these ways is obviously the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on the issue of the European Maritime Safety Agency, the headquarters of which have not been decided. The fact that the headquarters of this agency have not been decided should not lead us to conclude that we should also not fund it. We need to put sums of money in reserve so that, when the headquarters are decided, we are ready to fund this agency, which will play a particularly important role in these issues of safety at sea which we debated this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to underline the importance of two issues to which we are not, I think, paying proper attention. One is tourism, where we consider that a number of pilot programmes which will strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in particular should be funded and, the second, which is sometimes undervalued, is safe transport where, here too, we believe that we could proceed to increase the funds somewhat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem has been clearly explained: to see the budget lines for essential policies cut so drastically by the Council worries us extremely.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to you that it worries us because it happens all the time. Whatever the decision-making procedures, whatever the reports highlighting the European Union’s development needs, the same thing has happened for years: whenever budget time comes the Council makes the most astounding cuts to its programmes, which are nevertheless among the most important ones for encouraging development in the European Union. Time passes and nothing changes in this. Hence our concern and hence the Commission’s unanimity in seeking to use amendments to get the level of expenditure provided for in the preliminary draft budget reinstated.</p>
<p class="contents">I will return for a few moments to the issue of the Structural Funds and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for all the explanations he has given us. We can indeed see that the simplifications made are bearing fruit. We also note a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the management of those funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we want the European Union’s budget to take account of the reality of expenditure, which will avoid the Commission having to present supplementary draft budgets, which would be damaging to the peaceful implementation of these essential funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do in fact see, however, how the budgets and the payment appropriations have been significantly cut back, both in the Commission’s and the Council’s proposals, and, in the light of what you are saying today, it has of course to be wondered whether it is right to take matters so calmly, confident that there are enough payment appropriations, and whether a proposal for the supplementary budget is enough to solve the problem, if it emerges that the money is being used up more quickly than we anticipated. In recent years, we have of course seen that there has been a huge amount of money left over from the agricultural budgets in the autumn, but will that continue, with a falling dollar and other growing expenditure? That is a matter for reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it right to look at the problem constituted by the fact that it is not possible to have confidence in the reports we obtain from the Member States. Neither the Commission nor the Member States’ finance ministers have confidence in the reports obtained as to what needs exist. This is therefore worth investigating more carefully. I nonetheless think Mr Mulder has the right idea in saying we should increase the payment appropriations so that we might be sure that the projects can be implemented within the agreed time frames, even if those of us in my group have never supported large increases in the payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention something else, namely the issue of the cutbacks we see in a range of budget lines where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. In particular, we see how, within the action programme for the working environment, the budget is being drastically cut back, and that, I think, is a completely wrong signal to send out prior to enlargement. I want to attach a lot of importance to our being able to obtain an exchange of knowledge and development of experience in the area relating to the working environment, so that free competition in the EU is not at the expense of a good working environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally agree with what Mrs Jensen said on this subject a moment ago. It is regrettable that some areas leave something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to ask for attention to be paid to the European Year of the disabled which we are celebrating at the moment and which is also reasonably successful. It is, in my view, very important that we should provide an opportunity for follow-up next year. I also hope that provision can be made for this in the budget during the course of this budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make a brief comment further to what Commissioner Barnier has stated. Needless to say, we have all looked into the figures. It is indeed satisfying to see that the situation has improved particularly over the past few months and that a little more money is being spent than during the period immediately preceding it. Despite this, I do think that we have not solved the problem by a long way. Neither am I completely convinced that we need an additional budget. I myself do not expect this at all.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we see happening? Countries are working out how much money they would need to spend in order to use up all the money that has been allocated to them. Those countries are saying: well, it should be this or that amount, which they subsequently find impossible to spend. They are far too optimistic and there is no monitoring procedure of any kind. I think that we ought to be extremely grateful to the Commissioner for having introduced all kinds of gentle mechanisms that will hopefully rectify the situation to some degree. For years, I have been indignant about the fact that everyone knows that there are too many payment credits and that the money is not being spent. The only thing we notice at the end of the year is that a great deal of money is retuned to the Member States. I think we should put a stop to this. This is probably more important than approving the occasional additional budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two multiannual programmes that become effective from the start of next year are an indication of that.

It is a positive sign that enlargement is being taken into consideration in the Socrates-Youth programme and Culture 2000 programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Switching to an activity-based budget will mean the opportunity to establish a legal basis for the financing of European cultural organisations.

I do hope that that is not the case, but do not worry, I will not take advantage, I will answer as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone who has expressed an opinion on Structural Funds policy, for which I am responsible together with Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler, in particular regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to go back over the figures I confirmed today and which I sought to give as the most sincere and honest answer possible to the questions put by the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and Mr Hatzidakis’ Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. The first assessment I outlined before you confirms what I said on 22 May about the period 1994-1999, which for me is the black spot, or at least the grey spot: the procedure used for this programming was so unwieldy that control and certification became concentrated at the end of the period. Mr Hatzidakis, what applies to this period is not n+2 but, you might as well say, n+11. That is the objective reason for the amount of work we have to do to process and check the 2 000 files received. I repeat that my colleagues and I will not skimp this certification period; I shall have no hesitation in taking any measures that may be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to lower the quality of the controls or the level of information and certification required by rules with which we are all familiar. Mr Hatzidakis is right when he says that the n+2 procedure adopted for new programmes in 1999 is more efficient and is already producing better results, creates an impression of continuity and results in a smaller number of regular cancellations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk, I am not satisfied either, even if progress has been made. I am not going to act self-satisfied in front of you, believe me. I am simply noting, like you, a better use for the period 2000–2006. This improvement is due mainly to the n+2 rule and our ongoing cooperation with the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hatzidakis, I will pass on your comments on the matter of transport and road safety to Mrs de Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Jensen for their appraisal of our management under your supervision. Mrs Guy-Quint, we are at this moment making progress on programme appraisal. I am thinking in particular of the efforts being made by Mr Likanen, Mr Monti and myself to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to cover areas not yet served by mobile telephones or the Internet. Let us have less padding and more quality. We are doing so already, but with the future regional policy we are working on and for which I need your support we can go a lot further. The future objective 2 policy in particular will enable us, in partnership with the regions and governments, to implement directly the major objectives of Göteborg and Lisbon relating to competitiveness and sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jensen, I shall be continuing the efforts we have begun. The commitment appropriations that you regretted were cut do not fall under heading 2 for which we are responsible. They are transport appropriations, like those for small and medium-sized undertakings. I therefore think that Commissioner Schreyer understood those comments correctly, but I cannot answer this point because there is no reduction in the commitment appropriations, which, incidentally, were safeguarded for the whole period in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk, I have answered your question. I am not sure that we will need the supplementary budget I mentioned just now, but as I am being transparent with you I am mentioning it to you at this stage. So far as 2003 is concerned, we do need an amending budget. We may need a supplementary budget next year, but that is not certain. It is simply that we have to be able to pay when the time comes. I do not want States that are capable of consuming and implementing to be penalised on the pretext that there are some bad pupils in the class.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Iivari, your comment was addressed more to Mrs Reding, but I have heard it. Regarding the cultural cooperation of which you spoke – even though it is not my subject, I am sensitive to what you have said in this regard – in the forthcoming debate on regional policy after 2007 I intend proposing an increase in our appropriations for Interreg and a simplification of that programme’s rules, in order to target cross-border cooperation in transport infrastructures in particular. In that field, too, we need cultural and university cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are, Mr President, I have taken more than a minute but less than 11 minutes and I thank you for your understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very glad that this House’s rapporteur, Mr Mulder, has noted that everything related to home affairs and justice policy in the European Union has a close connection with enlargement, and that he himself has already made some necessary proposals. It makes things much easier for those of us who deal with home affairs and justice policy if the rapporteur who understands us best is right alongside us. I must, secondly, extend warm thanks to Commissioner Vitorino for the excellent cooperation with his staff, which has gone outstandingly well. Although our proposals relating to the 2004 Budget were adopted unanimously, I must simply point out, now that we are debating them in plenary, that this year, we have a priority issue in the shape of our three agencies. What particularly makes our agencies in Vienna, Lisbon and the Hague very important to us is the fact that we will soon have ten new Member States, which will make more work for the agencies in the areas of combating racism, drug crime, criminal activities and terrorism. Our monitoring centres in Vienna and Lisbon, along with Eurojust in The Hague are three agencies in need of active support, and that will cost money. I take it as read that my fellow-MEPs who sit on the Committee on Budgets will join with us in seeing the need for this and in giving us their support in this House.

<p class="contents">This committee takes less than 1% of the EU budget, but I would not want anyone to think that we should see education, culture, media and information as optional extras. The creative industries in Europe contribute some 12% to Europe's GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would particularly like the Commission to heed. Firstly, in its culture budget each year, Parliament helps a number of cultural organisations and networks such as the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation. If these organisations are to survive, let alone flourish, then they not only need our financial and moral support, they need legal certainty. I am appalled that at the end of September, there is still no guarantee they will get their money for 2004 and sadly, as usual, some have not yet been paid for 2003. I urge the Commission to resolve this legal base problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if EU citizens are to know about the EU they require information. 25% of Britons do not know their country is in the EU. 31% of Germans have never heard of the European Commission and 90% of Spaniards do not know what the European Convention is! The public learn about Europe through television. We have Euronews, an excellent independent channel, but like all public sector broadcasters, it needs funding. This year Parliament voted EUR 3 million for Euronews. As far as I am aware, that money has not yet been paid. We have proposed in our budget suggestion for next year that it should receive EUR 5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that we could enter the year of enlargement - the year of European elections - with no European Youth Orchestra and no European television. I hope the Commission will take these points seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, from a statistical point of view the budget for justice and internal affairs has increased by 252% this year. In reality, however, much of that increase is the result of the decision taken in Copenhagen to create the Schengen facility, at a cost of EUR 317 million, to help the seven future Member States to adopt and incorporate the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Another EUR 13 million are for transitional measures for Lithuania in connection with transit to and from Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as justice and internal affairs are concerned, the most important changes from the budgetary point of view are therefore the enlargement-related increase in appropriations for programmes (EUR 16 million) and the increase in appropriations for control of the external frontiers, which has been a major European Union priority since the Seville and Thessaloniki summits. I would like to stress the importance of the ARGO programme in support of frontier control operations carried out jointly by the Member States; this is given an extra EUR 15 million. I would also like to highlight the creation of a new budget line for development of the VIS project, a visa information system, to which EUR 10 million will be allocated initially.</p>
<p class="contents">This year 2004 will be marked by a number of important factors affecting budget management. It will be the last year of operation for the European Refugee Fund. We therefore need to learn from experience in making a new allocation after 2004. Then there is the doubling of the amount allocated to the Daphne programme, which will be 10 million for 2004. In this connection, I want to stress the importance of reaching a conclusion concerning the legal basis as quickly as possible in the codecision procedure between Parliament and Council. Finally, as rapporteur Ceyhun points out, the budgets for Eurojust and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon are increased in particular in order to enable those bodies to adapt to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposed amendments voted unanimously by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – for which I want to thank Mr Ceyhun – I am particularly pleased about the increase in the budget for the European Refugee Fund. However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that doing so today will allow voluntary return actions to be paid for and that there is absolutely no question of using this money for forced returns. There is therefore a contradiction between the fact that capacity is being increased and the comment. I would like to draw your attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased with the two amendments which the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed concerning the VIS system and the new generation Schengen information system, SIS II. Following the feasibility studies, it is in fact necessary to reprogramme expenditure for these two systems so as to spread the cost over the following three financial years 2004 to 2006, 2006 being the deadline for the SIS II system to become operational and therefore ready to fully integrate the countries that will join on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for its idea of creating an Erasmus programme for judges; the Commission will try to conduct a pilot project.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the field of information and communication. Following the adoption of the Bayona de Perogordo report, 2003 was the first year in which we developed a new information and communication strategy for the general public. You will remember that the cornerstone of this strategy is cooperation with the Member States, the establishment of partnerships with the Member States. I am pleased to say that the interinstitutional group on information and communication has managed to reach broad agreement on what should be the priority subjects for such public information and communication campaigns. I am speaking not only of the euro, but also of enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice and, for next year 2004, the role of Europe in the world, including a specific line to support information campaigns in the field of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, however, and in saying this I am trying to answer the comments made by Mr Ferber just now. This is in fact the second time I have tried to answer him today, but he is never there to hear me. I nevertheless hope that the message will get to him. When we are talking about partnership, we have to rely on the Member States being available to take part in such a partnership. For example, EUR 4 million were reserved for such partnerships with the Member States for the information campaign on the Future of Europe. Up until now, however, only three Member States have said they are willing to reach an agreement with us in order to develop the campaign on the future of Europe. Since partnership is built on a voluntary basis, what the Commission has done is to allocate those EUR 4 million that were not used by the partnership with the Member States to other funds. Until the end of this year, therefore, we are covering the expenditure for the entire budget for the Future of Europe programme, including an invitation to tender for an audiovisual campaign on the future of Europe, amounting to EUR 4 million, and the reallocation of EUR 3.7 million for the production of printed objective information material for distribution at the end of this year and early next year on the conclusions of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress, as Mr Perry has said, that we attach great importance to the use of audiovisual systems. For this year 2003 we therefore have EUR 4 million for an audiovisual information strategy on enlargement, EUR 4 million for the Future of Europe and EUR 8.5 million for audiovisuals providing general information about the European Union, including the <span class="italic">Euronews</span> channel. I agree with you entirely, Mr Perry, that we should meet <span class="italic">Euronews’</span> request as Parliament agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done? We have granted <span class="italic">Euronews</span> EUR 1.5 million in accordance with the framework agreement signed with <span class="italic">Euronews</span> in 2001 and we have taken into account the further sum of EUR 3 million voted by Parliament. Having said that, Parliament has clearly said that those three million euros were not to finance <span class="italic">Euronews’s </span>administrative costs but to pay for its activities. We have therefore suggested to <span class="italic">Euronews </span>that it submit to us programmes for information activities and we are perfectly willing to assess them and finance them by releasing the EUR 3 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the question of the legal bases. This aspect is not my direct responsibility but I do know that the Commission has already put forward proposals for the creation of legal bases for a number of entities, including <span class="italic">Euronews</span>. I think that will be the best way of proceeding and the best approach for giving stability to such funding. I will eagerly await Parliament’s position on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I very much support what my colleague Mr Hatzidakis has said, namely that we must keep the lines as they were in the preliminary draft budget because there are no savings to be made on these policies for the present.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity, Commissioner, to respond to the problem of the policy of providing information to European Union citizens. This subject will really be one of the most important in the years ahead. You may know that several of us have tabled amendments to restore the lines to what they were last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing, however, is that all institutional communication should get as close to ordinary citizens as possible. What worries me the most about the present communications policy is that we do not have the necessary tools to reach those who are going to vote. The citizen’s ignorance of the present machinery and the institutions as they will be is quite appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">You have the resources, Commissioner, but for goodness sake let us ensure that they go to the heart of our present-day society. That would be a great step forward for the democratic future of our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So firstly, I should like to address Mrs de Palacio and secondly, Commissioner Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The TENs programme is a wonderful one, which allows transport, energy and telematics projects throughout Europe to be decided upon by the nation states themselves in order to connect the 15 countries now in the Union with the 10 countries coming in, embracing the whole of the European Union and making sure that each nation can build its part within the trans-European network. I have nothing but full confidence in that programme. I would just point out that there is an item of some EUR 225 million for studies relating to it in the budget, whereas the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, of which I am a substitute Member, says that they do not want more studies but more action and implementation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Marco Polo programme on transfer to other modes of transport, away from road traffic and the congestion which it causes, I give that my full support. We need to have more telematics and computer information technology used to advance the efficient movement of goods and passengers throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Touching upon the Galileo project, we need to maximise the use of the private sector. I welcome this project. I hope that we will not use it for automatic levying of tolls on lorries, but rather allow individual drivers of private commercial vehicles to avoid congestion by knowing their best route from where they are to where they want to go: in other words, to help the motorists rather than tax and hinder them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other institutions, we have had useful discussions in the last day or two. I was delighted to attend the conciliation meeting in July and pay tribute to Mr Magri and his superb chairmanship of that committee. There was one matter that was left. That was where our rapporteur, Mrs Gill, thought that the Commission and the Council were being generous - I would say extremely generous - in their attitude to the budgets proposed by three of the other institutions: the Court of Justice, the Committee of the Regions, and the Economic and Social Committee. Whereas Parliament's budget is only going up by 13%, the Council's by 21% and the Commission's by 8% or 9%, the Court of Justice, for example, is asking for 57%. I am delighted the Council has knocked that figure down to 46%. But in an amendment that we tabled from the United Kingdom delegation, we are asking for a further, similar reduction. The same applies to the Economic and Social Committee. It asked for 33%, knocked down by the Council to 27%. We want it down by the same percentage again. The Committee of the Regions asked for 63% and was knocked down to 54%. We want a further reduction to 46%.</p>
<p class="contents">We can afford these increases, but that is not the point. We must get the best possible value for money from these other institutions and ask them to re-examine their budget spending. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is EUR 3 million less than in the budget for 2003. This, despite the fact that the objectives of the fund are rather bold: promoting the integration of newcomers and organising solidarity between the EU Member States when receiving refugees. In actual fact, a much larger fund is needed to share the responsibility effectively and put an end to the negative policy rivalry between the Member States to adopt the strictest asylum policy. As long as three years ago, I, backed by this House, asked the Commissioner to make an assessment of how much money he would actually need in order to realise the Fund’s objectives. As I have never seen this assessment, I should like to remind him of this request. It is particularly important to give this a lot of consideration, because the Commission will be presenting its plans for the financial perspectives in mid-November. Mr Vitorino, I therefore rely on your courage.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is there insufficient money in the Fund structurally speaking, the Fund’s objectives are also at risk of being contaminated. Less funds for the distribution of the cost of reception, but more emphasis on sharing the burden of repatriation policy. In fact, the Member States now want forced repatriation to be paid for from the Refugee Fund. However, the question as to who can stay and who has to go is still the subject of a debate between Member States, and is simply a national decision. It therefore seems very wrong to me to pay European tax money for national decisions. As long as we have not reached agreement on who can stay on European territory and who has to go, it seems wrong to cover the cost of forced repatriation from the European budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear to us that small and medium-sized businesses are of particular significance in terms of Europe’s economic development. Whilst we have heard that in many contributions to today’s debate, we know that we are directly affected by many developments on the international stage, one example being Basel II. That is why we have decided to seize the initiative and introduce a pilot scheme facilitating guarantees through the European banks for especially small businesses. I believe that such guarantees will play an essential part in the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises. Support of this kind is especially important when businesses are being set up.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we have just got through the failed assembly in Cancún, the failure of which is attributable to the presence in the ministerial conference of certain persons who make a very healthy profit from their own system and are therefore unwilling to do for their national economies something that we would see in a favourable light. This leads us to believe that there is an urgent need for a parliamentary assembly in this area. We want to lend our active support to this in future and to discuss the possibilities with parliamentarians from the countries in question, with the opposition in certain countries also being given the opportunity to state its position on international issues. With this in mind, we should concentrate on representing Europe on the international stage, taking a share in decisions rather than just sharing in paying the bills.

I think a successful information policy is a policy that gets as close as possible to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we developed this strategy of partnership with the Member States, including regional and local authorities. It is an approach which also enjoys the support of the Committee of the Regions. But if this approach is to succeed, there must be the political will for a partnership. There must be at least two partners. That is why I hope, so far as the campaign on the future of Europe is concerned, that the European elections, the national debate on ratification of the Constitution and the referendums that will be held in some Member States will next year all be further incentives, further reasons for the Member States to join in partnership with us to conduct information and communication campaigns on the future of Europe, on the content of the Constitution, and to conduct those campaigns as closely to the citizens as possible.

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the fund is managed in a very decentralised way.</p>
<p class="contents">The option on the priorities of the use of money from the fund is given to the Member States, providing they respect the general guidelines on the legal instruments. Therefore, I want to tell you very frankly that up to now, when it comes to return, only 28% of fund money of the has been used by Member States on return actions. I would emphasise once again that the fund can only be used for 'voluntary' returns. I underline that: 'voluntary' returns. There is no possibility at all to use fund money for 'forced' returns. This impossible; it is against the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are conducting a fully comprehensive evaluation of the fund this year so that we can have a better assessment on the way the Member States have used the fund. This will also enable us provide you with new guidelines and an amount of money for the fund for the new financial perspectives.</p>

The Union has set ambitious targets to promote renewable energy sources and combined heat and power production. With regard to reaching these targets it is unfortunate that cuts in the area of research into energy have been proposed in the budget. If we support the diverse use of local renewable energy resources we will improve security of energy supply and reduce dependence on imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis of transport policy must be the development of a versatile transport network, decongestion, improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport. The development of trans-European transport networks has not progressed in the way that was hoped for, owing to inadequate funding. Only three of the 14 Essen projects have been finalised, and in the summer Mr Van Miert’s group listed a number of new TEN-T projects. The Union, for its part, must set aside the necessary funds for both the old and the new projects and take account of the needs of an enlarging Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For the internal market to function there have to be flexible transport connections between the different regions of the Union. Transport connections in the peripheral regions are a vital necessity. In the summer the Commission issued a communication on the development of transport in the Mediterranean region. I think a similar communication should also be drafted with regard to transport in the north. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also call for more resources, of course, but we must be aware that we are dealing – my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has just discussed this – with specific financial perspectives and we have specific limits.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the support for renewable energy sources, as the honourable Member is well aware, we are dealing with this jointly with support for energy efficiency by means of the intelligent energy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member will think that this is not much money. The truth is that we have approved it on a multi-annual basis and, in the end, we reached agreement with the Council. Once we have agreements, I believe that we must conserve them and maintain them and I would therefore refer back to what we approved and adopted at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the trans-European networks, I have said very clearly, with a view to the next financial perspectives, that the amount dedicated to trans-European networks must not be increased by 5, 10 or even 15%, but, in my opinion, by 600 or 700%. In other words, it should be multiplied by 7. As simple as that. We need some EUR 4000 million if we are really going to be able to act as the driving force behind the construction of networks of a trans-European nature, and not of a solely national nature.</p>
<p class="contents">These trans-European networks of a trans-European nature are necessary in view of the reality of the internal market and for the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole, and I can therefore only agree with the honourable Member but, I would insist, this cannot be done by modifying budgets, but by reviewing the new financial perspectives, given the great importance of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the transport networks, in relation to the energy sector, I have already presented specific projects for Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, which must allow, firstly, for the rationalisation of investments made in a series of countries and greater coordination and efficiency in investments, thereby achieving not just purely national benefits from certain investments, but providing a broader continental-type perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about these Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, I am talking about Europe as a continent, not the European Union. These networks also take account of neighbouring countries such as Russia, Belarus or the Ukraine. In other words, the whole ring of friends included by President Prodi in his strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the transport sector we are working on it, and I hope that in the near future we will be able to make it a reality. Specifically, I was in St Petersburg a week ago discussing these very networks, and in this case they were even Euro-Asian, because we should be seeking systems to better integrate, in a continental sense, the European Union with our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament once again for supporting the proposals we have presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is clearly a constituent phase and, not least in the new Constitution, for instance, the European Parliament will be given wider, more extensive powers. This is a welcome, inevitable, historical fact, and we have, without a doubt, given fresh impetus to the process which will certainly give the European Parliament greater autonomy, more clout and greater representativeness in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we must focus for a moment on the points made during the debate. Without mentioning any one issue in particular, I would like to stress that the Council is quite prepared to look at all the recommendations made. Moreover, it must be said that, even in the introductory report and in the meetings which have taken place thus far on all the issues – including that of the availability of new posts for Commission staff and other matters such as the cut in preaccession funds and so forth – the Council has been completely open to reassessing the proposals on the basis of new approaches, new information and new decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say a word in defence of the Council – which has been somewhat ill-treated, so to speak, by some of the Members in their speeches – and explain that, in cases such as this, the Council has the task of seeking to realise and harmonise many different expectations. Since the European budget is, of necessity, the result of prioritising and compromise, it is not always possible to say ‘yes’ to everybody immediately. For precisely this reason, I would ask the Members not to make the mistake of attempting to criticise the intentions of others, for we all have the right to criticise our own intentions but, above all, we have a duty to display full confidence in others. I believe that this is one of the principles of democracy, of our political culture, and I believe it is a principle that we all share. It is precisely because we do have shared cultural models, because we believe in a united Europe, that we realise that there is a great difference between the management of power and politics. Politics is the management of power harmonised according to a cultural model. I believe that our shared cultural models will help us to achieve an excellent result at the next reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The importance of enlargement goes without saying, and it has also become clear how important the other priorities are for the 2004 Budget. The debate has also, I believe, made it clear that the Commission must have the necessary human resources at its disposal. This is an area in which I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being so frank in what he said.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite happy to provide any information required by the members of the Committee on Budgets, by the Council, or by Parliament, and the Budget Directorate-General is also at your service.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might take up again the issue of the quality of public service at the European level, the Budget Directorate-General has a department with seventy staff to handle everything to do with drawing up the Budget – the drafting, the hearings, all the information, the transfers, the supplementary budgets, the lot. When I compare that figure with the numbers required in the Member States and compare the quality involved, I can say loud and clear and with a clear conscience that the service is first-rate. Those who have any dealings with it will, I think, be able to back me up on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say how very grateful I am for this debate, and that I am confident that we will be able, once more, to produce a good European Budget for 2004, one that will do a good job of promoting enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank in particular Mr Magri and his officials for being here all this time. As I said at the beginning, it is rare to have ministers here. The Danes set this trend, and I congratulate Mr Magri for keeping it up. I also congratulate the Commissioners who have participated in this debate. On the whole, it has gone quite well. However, occasionally we have strayed from the subject. The idea of having the Commissioners here is to question them directly on specific issues, and not all Members have done that. Perhaps we need to refine our act for next time. All in all, although it has been long, it has been well worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
