It is right and proper that the European Parliament, and that the European Union should support those who have the difficult task of tracing and bringing to justice the guilty parties. I am talking about human rights activists, lawyers and judges. In the past, support for such people from the Guatemalan authorities has often been lacking. Consequently, I fervently hope that that support will increase after and because of this resolution. But – and here I am appealing to those fellow Members of the PPE-DE who are present – in that case we must be honest and not place people above the law. That is what is threatening to happen now. You probably know who I am talking about, Mr Rios Mont, at present speaker of the parliament. He too, he more than anyone, will have to account for his past as military dictator and accordingly, I hope that this Parliament will include that responsibility of his and others’ in the 1980s explicitly in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, we know today that three army officers and a priest – it is terrible that a priest should have been involved – have been sentenced for this crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe a series of proceedings should be started against all those involved in the murder of Bishop Gerardi, as suggested in the very well-balanced report on the case, entitled ‘Guatemala, never again’. Otherwise impunity would become a serious problem for the future of Guatemala. To this end we believe the European Union should help protect all the witnesses, judges and defenders of human rights in Guatemala who are working towards this. I am quite sure that we in the European Union can do this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demand that all those working against impunity should be protected and that the facts with which this report is concerned should be made known. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Punishment is not always the crucial factor. What is crucial is to bring out the truth. Prosecutions must be brought because the truth must come out if people are not to be deceived again. Guatemala has ratified the Geneva Convention and the convention aimed at preventing and punishing genocide. The Truth Commission has asked that the authorities now take legal proceedings against those who have practised or supported genocide. The President has supported this, but we see both judges and others associated with the legal authorities being persecuted and killed, and it is regarding these matters that we too in this Parliament must keep the closest possible eye on the situation and keep up a maximum of pressure so that these processes are carried through with transparency and so that the truth emerges and the skeletons come out of the cupboard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The joint resolution we have tabled, resulting from the unanimous agreement of all the political groups in this Parliament, underlines the homogeneous and consistent position of this House, which has for so long been committed to human rights in general and the Guatemalan people in their search for peace in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent court sentences, such as the one that has been mentioned regarding the murder of Bishop Gerardi, have revealed just how important it is that justice and the rule of law should take their usual course and function normally, as in any democratic system, but we must not forget or stand in the way of the changes and pressures that have arisen in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show our concern for the situation of violence, involving assaults on individuals and members of the judiciary, that has occurred and which has, of course, caused turmoil.</p>
<p class="contents">The rationale of wounds kept open for a long time is in any case unjustifiable, and the sooner a stop can be put to this the sooner Guatemala can move towards democracy, respect for the rule of law, development, peace and social improvement, leading to prosperity and the creation of the climate of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect that we so strongly desire for Central America and Guatemala.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not in favour of supporting Mrs Frassoni’s amendment to take concrete action against military commanders. In our opinion the indiscriminate nature of this amendment is not good. Moreover, we would be taking over the role that belongs to the courts, whom we want to support in their vital task of pacification and re-establishing the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The whole history of huge estates, owned by the <span class="italic">capituleros</span>, goes back much further. That also explains why a country with such an institutional background, finds it terribly difficult, despite the peace agreements, to resource the authorities, values, the standards and the democratic capacity really to put its past behind it and to regard the peace agreements as a new beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Rigoberta Menchu is someone who appealed strongly to the indigenous population. It is still that population that is afraid and feels how strong the opposition is, but I believe that President Portillo is sincere in this and is trying to take new steps.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the reason why I, contrary to what the honourable Member from the PPE-DE said, still believe that the amendment is meaningful. Because it makes it clear that even those circles which have long regarded and felt themselves to be beyond and above the law, must be subjected to the full force of the law and not exempted. Someone like Rios Mont with his coterie of relations and contacts definitely belongs to those circles. On that point I also hope that the Commission will draw strength from this. It will not do so without sufficient international support. In that sense what we do here in the European Parliament is also of great value and significance. In this resolution the new phase in which Guatemala finds itself is recognised, and the legitimacy of the government is fully recognised. I hope that the resolution will also be in honour of Rigoberta Menchu. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, there is a climate of persecution against all opponents, with union activists being arrested and then the ballot boxes are stuffed with an extra one million votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, however, to all those who still doubt whether a policy of neo-colonialism is at work, that it is the international community and above all, my country, France that bear responsibility for what has happened in Chad. France has maintained a military presence in that country since independence. The army printed the ballot papers and made the ballot boxes. It is the army that transported the material needed for voting to the most distant provinces of this vast desert country.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that France bears direct responsibility and that France has colluded in this electoral fraud, or, in any event, has directly or indirectly contributed to it. The silence of the international community is due to the fact that enormous oil deposits have just been discovered in Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the European Union, Commissioner, must immediately condemn the role of the international oil companies, which not only show no concern for the environment, but also care little for the interests of the communities they affect and even less for democracy. I therefore feel that this is a real textbook case, which we could still call, forgive me for saying so, a neo-colonialist policy in Africa.</p>

Is Deby aware that he is irrevocably bound to honour the agreements he has made? The World Bank did not put almost NLG 4 billion into the oil project lightly. Nor are the European Cotonou resources unconditional. The aid creates obligations but all the indications are that the president is trying to wriggle out of them. Deby used part of the oil consortium’s advance millions to acquire weapons. In so doing he broke his promise to the World Bank that he would use the money to fight poverty. The elections appear to have been heavily rigged. The restrictions on press freedom and the arbitrary arrests among the opposition once again underline the lack of democracy.

We were also looking at human rights in that country. Today we three have tabled this motion because our concern then for human rights has been compounded now by allegations following the presidential elections. It is right that we should not jump to conclusions. It is right that we should take note of the OAU monitors, who thought that the elections were broadly fair. It is equally right that we should take note of the views of those other observers and human rights groups who thought they were not.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Chad needs to reassure public opinion in Chad and throughout the world by holding an independent and a public inquiry into the allegations that have been made. The European Union should insist on this. We are major investors in Chad and we should certainly be thinking of sending monitors from this Parliament to Chad for next year's parliamentary elections. However, there are questions to which we demand answers.</p>
<p class="contents">First, if there are 4 million voters registered in Chad and another half million registered abroad, how can 5.6 million people have voted? Is it true that children were seen with ballot papers? Secondly, why were the OAU and other international observers not allowed into the north of the country? Thirdly, why were the officials of polling stations in the north replaced at midday by military and other civilian personnel? Fourthly, if the total votes recorded in the south were overwhelmingly for opposition candidates as alleged, how can the overall vote have been calculated as it was? Fifthly, is it true, and I believe it was, that a women's delegation seeking to present a petition to the French Ambassador was shot at and dispersed by military personnel? Sixthly, is it true that the six opposition candidates were arrested after the election and one of these, Mr Yorongar, was beaten and wounded? I met him in Chad and I met him again this afternoon when he showed me evidence of the treatment he has been receiving in a Paris hospital. All these questions must be answered and accounted for. That is our demand and it is the demand of the people of Chad.</p>

Accusations of electoral fraud, arrests and torture of members of the opposition, demonstrations broken up violently. We condemn these violations of fundamental rights in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a further question – in fact I agree with all the questions posed by the honourable Member from the PPE-DE. Is Idriss Deby in fact a new oil dictator ? It is of course not very friendly to put it in those terms, but it looks very much as if the money earned from oil extraction is being misused to keep him in power. Does this mean that Chad will follow in the footsteps of countries such as Nigeria, Angola and Sierra Leone? We know the impact of the extraction of raw materials such as oil and diamonds have had, and are still having, on the conflicts in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chad-Cameroon pipeline project is receiving help from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. Parliament expressed its concerns about the pipeline project as early as January 2000. Unfortunately, recent events in Chad seem to have proved us right. The special set-up of the project is intended to guarantee that the proceeds are used for the economic and social development programmes for the benefit of the poor, but the unstable situation in Chad is threatening these good intentions and that is unacceptable. Both the World Bank and we in Europe must increase pressure on Chad to ensure that the human rights situation there is improved. This may, as far as I am concerned, eventually lead to the cutting off of funding. At the same time the international companies involved must take their share of the responsibility. I would argue again – as I have previously done with other countries in Africa – for a code of practice between the international institutions and multinational oil companies, according to which the companies concerned commit themselves to the conditions of socially responsible business. Signature of this code of behaviour – which could be an initiative of the European Union or the Commission – should be a minimum precondition for multinationals to participate in projects in developing countries where public funding is used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again we see that democratic elections or elections intended to be democratic, are not conducted democratically. In Chad it turned into a real electoral hold-up. A coup in democratic guise, and foreign public opinion must not be fooled.</p>
<p class="contents">We have spoken to the representatives of Chad, as Mr Bowis has already mentioned. The people of Chad have no faith in their democratic institutions and they have been proved right. Attempts are being made to convince us by submitting pieces of legislation that supposedly guarantee that the oil revenues will be duly returned to the population and that the development of both north and south will hence be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, people warned us back then that President Idriss Deby, again undemocratically elected, would do nothing except use the oil money to strengthen his military power, and military power is replacing democratic power.</p>
<p class="contents">Reportedly no less than four and a half million out of six million inhabitants voted. Voting cards were distributed. They were sold. The population in the north was artificially increased and that in the south artificially reduced. To prevent the number of votes cast finally exceeding the number of inhabitants, votes from abroad by citizens of Chad were simply not counted. In short, we cannot accept such a travesty.</p>
<p class="contents">The complaints submitted up to now appear to have been all rejected by the highest authorities and reportedly the results of the election have been declared definitive. We simply cannot take this. In so doing we are depriving ourselves, our citizens and own democratic institutions of credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to urge the French government most strongly not to shirk its responsibility. Whenever we go to a West African country, we can see the extent to which French influence is still present there. It serves purely neocolonial ends and we cannot support it.</p>

Such a percentage should not leave any doubt as to the legitimacy of his election, were it not for the accusations of irregularities made by the other candidates and the independent national election monitoring body.</p>
<p class="contents">President Déby has himself declared to high profile media that irregularities are common in African elections and democracies, but one should not hide behind a general evil to justify internal outrages.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, we are not talking about technical problems, which may occur, even in the most stable democracies. We are talking about the use of coercion against opposition candidates, restrictions of the most basic freedoms that have to be set in motion during an electoral process, and finally we are talking yet again about the operation of the rule of law, which even at the most basic levels is open to question on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">As so often happens, it is up to the European Parliament to appeal to the European Union bodies responsible for foreign relations to assess whether, with the confirmation of the election result, democracy in Chad is making any progress. If we are to believe some of the complaints, the facts that emerge are so serious that they are absolutely unacceptable in the twenty-first century. Yet again we must reiterate the need to use all the means at our disposal, especially those provided for in the Cotonou Agreement, and our cooperation with the community of ACP countries, particularly the African ones, to prevent and to correct highly dubious acts such as those that have just occurred in Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all ensure the success of those who are working hard to achieve decent levels of democracy, freedom and progress in those countries, as a necessary precondition for stability and prosperity to become a reality in their societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists asks you to support their resolution and also asks the Commission to adopt their declaration so that the government of Chad can learn of our concern and the sections of Chadian society that have been edged out of the electoral process can realise that they can count on our solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be further opportunities, particularly the legislative elections announced for March 2002, which must not be thwarted, to create a real framework of democratic coexistence in Chad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Parliament chooses to some extent to forget this country and the others that belong to the Barcelona ‘mish mash’ of countries that are party to the Euro-mediterranean agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in Egypt, rather strange things are happening. The case of Mrs El Saadawi is typical. She is accused of apostasy and is threatened with compulsory divorce, a custom which, I hope, my fellow Members will want to take a closer look at. Mrs El Saadawi is in danger of being sent to prison. I wish to thank the one hundred fellow Members who agreed to sign an appeal on her behalf, together with many international celebrities. Mrs Bonino and other Members of the European Parliament will be in Cairo over the next few days in order to defend her and to be with her during her trial. I think that it is Parliament’s duty to react robustly.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure that has inspired this court case is called ‘Hisba’ and can only be initiated by men or women of the Muslim faith. The procedure runs completely counter to the Egyptian Constitution, especially to its Article 40. I therefore call on all honourable Members to support this fight, of which I do not think we have seen the last and I also call on the Commission to support Mr Ibrahim. Mr Ibrahim worked with Commission funds and has been accused of fraud, even though the Commission usually carries strict controls. It would, therefore, be only appropriate for the Commission to come to his defence as vigorously as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was thirty years ago, at a time when making such a condemnation was no easy matter, especially if you were from one of the countries in which this is practised.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, Mrs El Saadawi has ceaselessly pursued her feminist struggle, in newspapers, articles, books and by maintaining a considerable public presence. We are fully aware, then, of who this woman is. In treating her as she is being treated today, a lack of respect is being demonstrated to all her commitment. Perhaps we should focus on the fact that the prosecution is now recommending that the charges against her be dropped. As Mr Dupuis has just said, her trial will take place next week, but perhaps under international pressure – and I thank Mrs Bonino for having made this appeal, which I myself signed – Egypt will, as we hope, reconsider its decision. I would nevertheless remind you that divorce...</p>

The country maintains important relations with the United States and Europe. Unfortunately there is still no internal stability. As long ago as 1967 a state of emergency was declared and has never been revoked. Egypt is still far from being a democracy. It lacks essential political freedoms and human rights are violated. The government restricts the activities of political parties, human rights organisations, professional associations and the press. People are imprisoned without trial and tortured. Show trials are still held. The recent sentencing of the American sociologist Ibrahim fits very well into this poor picture. It proves that jurisprudence is controlled by political motives and is unjust. As an important partner of Egypt’s, we should protest emphatically against these abuses. The Barcelona process will never get off the ground if democratisation is bogged down in autocratic reluctance. Stability means something else besides stripping people of rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several other human rights defenders are also experiencing legislative and judicial harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of emergency, the law on association and the judicial system have been put in place to repress all freedom of expression, which reveals how far off course the government is with regard to respect for human rights, especially where torture and ill treatment are concerned.

<p class="contents">The government does not respect the obligations of international law or the international undertakings given over recent years, including Article 2 of the Association Agreement concluded with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital that the Egyptian authorities condemn all these expressions of violence and ensure the protection of its citizens. It must implement real measures, especially on behalf of women, minors and prisoners. It must guarantee an independent system of justice with investigations and inspections and renounce any legislation which restricts freedom of expression and association. It must not enforce a state of emergency whenever it wishes to restrain democratic freedoms and the activities of all these human rights campaigners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nobody would be mistaken for thinking that this is an agreement of the heart with this friendly country. Given that negotiations were concluded in June 1999, the Association Agreement is due to be signed very soon and we will be asked to take a stand on this text.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope it will mark the start of a new momentum in our relations with Egypt and the strengthening of our exchanges and our mutual understanding, as this is one of the crucial objectives of this Association Agreement. It seems to me that we must not impose our own models and concepts and condemn certain attitudes out of hand. We must instead analyse, understand and support without, for all that, tolerating the unacceptable. This, to my mind, is the justification for this compromise resolution and I would like to thank those of my colleagues who helped to draft and support it, especially Mr Purvis and Mr Dary.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this resolution is to demonstrate the unfailing vigilance of my group and of this Parliament regarding respect for human rights around the world and especially in relation to our Mediterranean partners. We owe it to ourselves to remain intransigent on these issues whilst at the same time encouraging those who take the correct path. Mutual understanding is crucial and that is one of the messages I would like to get across today. Urgent or topical resolutions must not make us forget this. On the contrary, they must become the instrument of choice in our mutual understanding. Having raised this issue on numerous occasions with the Egyptian authorities, I know that they understand this and are willing to comply. That is what is important.</p>

The Egyptian police can only get away with this loathsome practice with the tacit authorisation of the Egyptian government, or indeed on its orders. There is every reason to believe that the leaders of the regime know that the great powers will turn a blind eye to it.

The reason for this draconian measure? Selim is campaigning for normalisation of relations between his country and the neighbouring state of Israel. For that reason I should like to add his name to those in the resolution before us.</p>
<p class="contents">For that matter, Selim’s expulsion does not come completely out of the blue. For the last four years the actions of this brave, independent Egyptian author has been a thorn in the flesh of his colleagues. The reason is plain. The Egyptian writers’ union forbids its members to have direct contact with Israel. Nevertheless Selim has so far visited Israel seven times. True to his vocation, he published his Israeli travel experiences. They were not well received by the writers’ union: exaggeratedly positive about Israel, was the collective judgment. However, author Selim went further. He spoke out openly in favour of an end to the present Palestine Intifadah. This was the last straw for the writers, since it bases itself on the so-called ‘Aksa-Intifidah’. In short, Selim's exclusion was inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time eleven other authors received warnings because of the same attitude as that of Ali Selim. Meanwhile the renowned member of the Egyptian writers’ union, the Nobel Prize winner Nagid Mafouz, has protested vehemently against these censorship measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see the Commission also take action in this matter. After all, regimentation of thought combined with the propagation of purely anti-Semitic ideas is diametrically opposed to the values and norms that the Member States of the European Union claim to advocate. In addition, the EU would in this way be contributing to reviving the flagging peace process in the Middle East. In any case this peace process is incompatible with the general political tenor of the Egyptian state press. The latter in fact deals wholesale in the most fantastic anti-Israeli and anti-Western stories and/or accusations. In its pages you can read the following, for example, about the visit of Colin Powell to "his bosses in Tel Aviv": "The American foreign minister had no qualms about abasing himself when he was in Israel. There he stood, humbly, a Jewish yarmulke on his head, in front of the monument to the (fictitious!) holocaust of the Jews.” No wonder that this year’s guest of honour at the Cairo book fair, the Arab equivalent of the Frankfurt <span class="italic">Buchmesse</span>, was Roger Garaudy. A man characterised in the European press as "the internationally infamous and hounded holocaust denier". All in all, the Egyptian interpretation of freedom of expression is highly selective politically. The Commission should also take the authorities in Cairo to task about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one of the this case. If ‘yes’, I shall be pleased to support Paragraph 4.

This <span class="italic">Internal Security Act</span>, or ISA, is used and abused for the purpose of getting at the Prime Minister’s political and personal enemies, as in a dictatorship. The same applies to the paragraph in the Malaysian constitution, the intention of which was to secure peace in the country and between the ethnic groups and which is now being used for the government’s own purposes. The former Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, said as long as fourteen years ago that it looked as though Mr Mahatir was on the way towards authoritarian government. It can safely be said that he has since continued along the same path. That is deeply regrettable, and it is good that Parliament is today getting to debate the matter and that we are getting a strong statement from the government.

He reminds me of a figure in European history, Kaiser Karl IV, a Luxembourgois, like Astrid Lulling, who managed to integrate Germans and Czechs, French and Italians at the heart of Europe and whose Golden Bull gave the Holy Roman Empire the most up-to-date and most cleverly balanced constitution of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="contents">The role played in Europe by Karl IV was played in twentieth century Malaysia by Tungku Abdul Rahman, who managed to strike a balance between Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist, Malay, Tamil and Chinese interests within a federalist structure headed by nine different families of sultans which take it in turns in a clever revolving system to rule this multi-ethnic state.</p>
<p class="contents">This fragile structure is based on respect for other people's culture. It is based on respect for the law. It is, of course, based first and foremost on respect for the rule of law, which is why it is a serious problem that this sensitive balance in Malaysia has been increasingly disturbed over recent years by the centralist policies of Prime Minister Mahathir, who started by showing a lack of respect for the individual states, followed, in his abuse of the Islamic faith, by an increasing lack of respect for the other religions, and who is now upsetting the balance between the various nationalities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that the so-called Internal Security Act is now being used to silence political rivals from within their own camp and drive the rule of law in Malaysia further and further back. This is particularly worrying because Malaysia occupies an important geopolitical position. It is also an important country economically. Above all, it is an important member of ASEAN, our partner community in South-East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we must do whatever we can to help Malaysia resurrect the spirit of Abdul Rahman or the Luxembourg spirit, which does so much to foster integration in our European Union. I think that Mr Mahathir's time is up and that new democratic forces need to take the helm in this country and renew the rule of law there; otherwise this complicated, multi-ethnic, multi-religious structure will become immersed in a blood bath as a result of excessive centralism and authoritarianism.</p>

I think that his way of perceiving events that have taken place or which are still ongoing in Egypt is very selective and that is up to him. Unfortunately, the future, as indeed the past, is unlikely to prove him right. As far as Afghanistan is concerned, I still believe that we may frankly be disappointed by the policy pursued by the European Union and, in particular, by the Commission and the Council as regards Pakistan which, as we know, is crucial for the future of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we adopt a very firm policy towards Pakistan, the Taliban will continue to do what they have been doing for years. The news is still fresh: the Taliban recaptured a town in the centre of Afghanistan. The first thing they saw fit to do was to bomb and destroy the hospital and to bomb and destroy the centre for humanitarian aid. This is a daily occurrence in Afghanistan. This is the Afghanistan we will continue to support indirectly until we have a tough policy against all those states which continue to support it, starting of course with Pakistan, but not forgetting Saudi Arabia and some other States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the Commission if it could give us any clear, precise indications as to the policies it intends to implement with regard to states which help this renegade state to remain in place. We know about the disasters, we have spoken about them very often, starting with the situation of women, but unfortunately they go far beyond that. They include the exclusion of the whole of Afghan youth from any form of education worthy of the name. We are very well aware that the Afghan version of the Koranic schools has nothing to do with education. It is therefore high time we got some concrete answers from the Commission and the Council, which is once again absent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Sikh and Hindu minorities will be required to wear a yellow identification sign on their clothes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Watch today reports the very latest atrocity in this never-ending story: 60 citizens imprisoned and official, residential and commercial buildings destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">When the regime in Kabul took over power it was to be recognised on the basis of three criteria: stamping out the drug trade, fighting terrorism and respecting human rights. The Taliban have scored a notable success only in reducing opium production. Consequently they are convinced that they will never gain international recognition, and hence opt for massive suppression, in other words mass murder, of their people. The first result of the policy of isolation is that all negotiations have become impossible and hence the only consequences of the sanctions is that a sorely tried people is being punished, that can do nothing but flee to camps in the hope of reaching Europe. So that the question is no longer whether the Taliban are violating human rights, but what conclusions must be drawn. Accordingly our group is submitting two amendments. If the Taliban also conquer the Panchi they will see themselves as the great victors over the West and the Russians, as a result of which they will completely abandon the attempt to achieve compromises with the international community. That might result in the NGOs being thrown out, which are the sole remaining source of information. Europe could suggest lifting sanctions and at the same time increasing the diplomatic pressure on Pakistan. This would slow down the advance of the Taliban and especially bring them back to the negotiating table. However, this will only be possible if at the same time there is investment in the NGOs operating there that are trying to improve the situation of men, women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I ask myself how we can receive representatives of the Afghan resistance, how we can support Afghan women – which I feel is a very positive thing – without going further and without having the means to express our indignation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that that is the purpose of this resolution, which is much better than the one we drafted two months ago, which I found rather weak, especially with regard to discrimination against women. Now, we seem able to talk about crime, about rape, about apartheid, about everything which reflects the situation of women nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is difficult. It has perhaps been made worse by our support for Commander Massud, Afghan women and many others, as well as the entire Afghan population, which is dying of hunger. If, in future, however, the effect of our support were to worsen sanctions, to prohibit women from driving for the NGOs working on behalf of women and to close bread shops which enable women to work, to feed themselves and to feed others, we must do more. And to do more, as has already been said, is to call the countries supporting the Taliban to account.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Community, the European Union, must not only give more money, it must know how to politically call to account those who support this regime and who allow this regime to survive. This is the logical outcome of our indignation and our support and it is also our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope that we stop confining ourselves to drafting resolutions which, even though each one is better than the last, are still too timid in relation to what we have to do for this suffering population.</p>

What are we to do, however, when the situation gets worse for women and for the Hazars, as mentioned today? We have a situation in which 170 civilians were executed in January and, as mentioned by Mr Dupuis and the others, there have been attacks in Yakaolang. What are we to do?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we know that, after the Tampere Summit in 1999, the EU approved a recommendation from a high-level working party concerning how we should deal with the Afghan situation. I believe that this strategy needs to be soberly appraised. We need to review it again. How should our embassies in Pakistan receive people who apply to be allowed to come to our countries? I have heard it said that they are sometimes treated like criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that we are seeking an Echo office in Afghanistan, something which should be reiterated. We must also give our support to the Christian organisations that are working in Afghanistan. There are Christian organisations that are doing an incredible amount for the Afghan population while maintaining a low profile. They, too, need our support. As has also been said by other speakers, we must also devote ourselves to getting the arms embargo into force and to ensuring that the UN gains access to the country in order, for example, to investigate the atrocities committed against the Hazars.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the measures that are needed. We cannot get any further by condemning matters time after time. One feels really powerless. We need a more intelligent policy in this sphere. I think that our experience in areas close to home has shown that a presence in the country can also yield good results and, above all, has a humanitarian basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few weeks ago, as previous speakers have mentioned, the statues of Buddha at Bamiyan were destroyed and radicalism continues to gain ground. Religious minorities – first the Hindus and now all non-Afghans <span class="bold">–</span> are forced to wear a yellow patch to identify themselves, resurrecting fatal memories of the totalitarian Nazi regime in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Taliban took over, the situation of the civilian population has deteriorated dramatically: women and girls are systematically oppressed, forced to wear the veil, denied an education and face the death penalty for adultery. Women are not even allowed to take part in the distribution of bread under the UN world food programme. They are no longer allowed to play leading roles, and the work of international organisations is being hugely obstructed. Men must wear a fez and grow a beard, thieves are maltreated and their hands are chopped off in public as a deterrent. The high Islamic priest of Egypt and numerous Muslims, Farid Wasil, is refusing the Taliban knowledge of the true values and ideas of the Koran and has declared their religious values and fatwas to be null and void.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we call on the government of Pakistan to refuse this regime any form of support, be it financial or moral.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost nothing has come of earlier promises to destroy poppy fields and opiates. Last Wednesday, German customs seized six kilos of heroin and 64 kilos of hashish worth EUR two million in a container from Afghanistan. Drug dealing is used to fund campaigns by religious fanatics and international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Bid Laden is still in Afghanistan, feted instead of extradited. The UN sanctions must stay in place, Commissioner, until Afghanistan makes the transition from the mediaeval world imposed by Mullah Omar to the modern world and hence to democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently – this also affects me as an Italian – an Italian hospital in Kabul, one of the few that was working in a decent, modern way, had to be closed because the staff were threatened with reprisals, since the regime would not accept that women could work there in close contact with male doctors and nurses. It has already been said that the regime has also recently ordered minorities to wear specially marked clothes in the street, which sadly recalls a Nazi practice that we hoped had disappeared for ever. All this has left us unable to believe any more in mere verbal condemnations and wondering what effective means there might be for the European Union to put pressure on Afghanistan. As has been said and as the joint resolution has emphasised, it is a question now of putting pressure on the countries that recognise Afghanistan diplomatically and also sustain it economically – Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc. – and effectively organising independent forms of assistance both inside the country, with the European Union supplying and distributing humanitarian aid, and outside on its borders where there are refugee and displaced persons’ camps, as in India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is extremely urgent, not just to help uphold human rights in that country but also to prevent the Taliban from helping to spread a fanatical, blood-shedding image of Islam in the West, which would add to the image cultivated by our own fundamentalists and racists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This country is now so extreme and medieval that paper bags are banned in case they contain pulped versions of the Koran and women are veiled, segregated from men and unable to work at all. Even chess and the flying of kites have been banned as un-Islamic, though there are many Islamic scholars who would contest such interpretations of the Koran. Indeed the rules imposed by the Taliban would appear to derive less from the Koran than from the tribal customs dependent on a view that sees women's value as essentially procreative and economic alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently the focus has been on ensuring that Muslims behave in accordance with Islam. However, in March, following a takeover of the Taliban by a hard-line faction linked to bin Laden, the extraordinarily beautiful 5th-century Buddhist statues in Bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite. Now echoes of Nazi Germany are heard as Hindus, many tens of thousands of whom I represent as a community in London, are required to identify themselves visibly in public with a yellow cloth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not suggesting that direct intervention in the country which defied the Red Army is either appropriate or feasible. Moreover, intervention in the internal affairs of other states by outsiders can often exacerbate and prolong a conflict, as may have happened in the Balkans. It may be that we simply have to wait for things to burn themselves out. Nor should it be forgotten that there is peace of a kind in most of Afghanistan now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Taliban should be left in no doubt that, should they want our help, they will have to listen to the widespread concerns of people around the world, who are shocked and horrified at the brutal character of their medieval regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is closely monitoring the situation there. There are increasing concerns within the EU and the international community about the considerable deterioration in that country in the situation in key areas such as human rights protection, justice and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's main priorities for relations with Guatemala are to support the implementation of the 1996 peace accords, which should lead to better respect for human rights; to promote the modernisation of the state; and to bolster good governance. The EU has been very supportive of the peace process in Guatemala, both politically and financially. The cooperation programme with Guatemala is aimed at giving adequate support to the peace process. The Commission has assisted civil society and state organisations, with the aim of contributing to the reconciliation process in the country. At the same time the Commission is preparing a programme to improve the justice system. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding, signed jointly by the European Commission and the Guatemalan government on the 26 March 2001, confirms our commitment to the peace process, with EUR 93 million of additional funds for the period 2001 to 2006. The Commission and Member States have also used the regular political dialogue with Guatemala to reiterate the importance of respecting human rights. The most recent EU actions raising concern about Guatemala have been the Joint Declaration of San José 17 meeting last March and the recent Declaration by the Swedish Presidency on the third anniversary of the assassination of Bishop Gerardi. In this respect the Commission welcomes the recent sentence in the Bishop Gerardi murder trial as encouraging proof of the commitment of the Guatemalan judiciary to improving the human rights situation. In addition, during a visit to Central America at the end of March 2001, my colleague, Commissioner Patten, called on President Portillo's government to take urgent action to avoid a negative spiral of events in Guatemala and reinvigorate the stalled implementation of the peace accords.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also closely monitoring the situation in Chad, after the announcement by the National Independent Electoral Commission of the result of the presidential election of 20 May. The calmness of the population on polling day and the high turnout demonstrated a civic commitment which should be praised. According to international observers the voting procedures conformed to legal regulations, but there were organisational deficiencies. A statement from the observation mission reported that opposition candidates listed certain instances of irregularities and fraud which they said had marred the vote. On 12 June the Constitutional Council announced the official election result confirming that Idriss Déby had won a second term in office with 63% of the votes. The Council reportedly rejected the vote in some polling stations. The situation is being closely monitored by the EU heads of mission on the ground. In the spirit of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission will continue its ongoing political dialogue with Chad. Chad has been engaged in a democratic process for the last ten years. This effort is leading to greater human and civil rights protection. However, it is recognised that these rights and liberties are not sufficiently respected by all actors. It will be essential to address these issues in order to ensure sustainable peace in the country. The ninth EDF country support strategy, which is at the final preparation stage, contains an important programme of support for civil society, including human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent sentencing of the well-known human rights and pro-democracy campaigner, Professor Saad Ibrahim, and his colleagues has aroused widespread interest in the international community. The case against Professor Ibrahim and his 28 co-accused at the Ibn Khaldun and HODA centres has been closely followed by the European Commission and Member States. When they were initially held without charge last year, the EU made its concern clear at the highest levels, with respect not only to the imprisonment without charge, but also to the intensive and prejudicial press campaign against the accused. When charges were eventually pressed against the accused, and when it was made clear that these included a charge of accepting foreign (that is, EU) funds without authorisation, the European Commission delegation in Cairo reminded the appropriate authorities that grants to civil society organisations were perfectly proper and covered by the EU-Egypt framework convention on financial and technical cooperation. Support for civil society is also an integral component of the Barcelona Process and is an explicit objective of the Barcelona Agreement of 1995, to which Egypt is a signatory.</p>
<p class="contents">The charges also claimed the misuse of EU funds allocated to the Ibn Khaldun and HODA pro-democracy programmes. The statement issued by the European Commission in Brussels on 13 December last made it clear that the projects concerned were subject to normal monitoring procedures, including an external mid-term audit. In answer to Mr Purvis's question in particular, I should stress that in 1999 the Commission received satisfactory progress reports from both projects regarding a satisfactory and independent financial audit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Egyptian authorities have so far provided no evidence or information to support their charges related to the projects financed by the EU. There have been EU observers present throughout the trial and the EU has always made clear its expectation that due legal process and justice would prevail. It has scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation. However, the timing of the sentencing a month earlier than expected and without apparent regard for the defence case presented in the closing day of the trial, and the severity of the sentences <span class="bold">–</span> 7 years for Ibrahim and lesser but nonetheless heavy sentences for all the accused – were entirely unexpected and quite disturbing.</p>
<p class="contents">The sentencing gave rise to an oral statement by the Commission on 23 May and a Presidency declaration on 25 May expressing deep concern. The EU used the opportunity to stress the importance it attaches to the development of civil society and reiterated that programmes to this end were an integral part of the EU's bilateral programming with Egypt. The European Commission is continuing to monitor the case closely. The court is obliged to give its reasons within one month of sentencing, and these will be read with interest. There are also limited possibilities for an appeal. The legal process is not finished, and it is to be hoped that the final outcome will reflect the best traditions of the Egyptian legal system. The Egyptian authorities are well aware of international interest in the case and of the implications of a final conclusion that is perceived as being unjust.</p>
<p class="contents">Nawal el Saadawi, the well-known feminist writer, was charged with apostasy, but the Prosecutor-General threw out the charges on 23 May. However, this does not appear to be an end to the matter, and charges may yet be pressed in another court. The situation is being carefully monitored by the Commission. The Ibrahim and Saadawi cases have both raised issues of real concern, although further legal steps and the possibility of a sensible outcome remain open. The overall situation is complex and not entirely clear. There are also some signs of optimism in some areas, for instance women's rights, elections controlled by the judiciary, social legislation and so on. There is an increasing section of Egyptian society which fully subscribes to the view that Egypt must adopt the highest standards and is working to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Malaysia, the Commission has followed closely the events relating to the detention by the Malaysian police of ten pro-reform activists under the Internal Security Act just days ahead of the second anniversary, on 14 April, of the conviction of the former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. It strongly regrets that on 2 June the Minister for Home Affairs signed two-year detention orders for four of the ten opposition activists and that three of the other six ISA detainees remain in police custody. The Commission is deeply concerned at these events, which it considers contrary to established democratic practice. They reinforce concerns already expressed in the past regarding the general human rights situation in Malaysia. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Malaysian National Human Rights Commission has questioned the basis of the arrests and that government representatives have stated that the ISA needs to be abolished or at least radically revised.</p>
<p class="contents">It also welcomes the fact that the High Court of Malaya, in setting free two of the ISA detainees under writs of <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> on 30 May, called on the Malaysian Parliament to review the ISA thoroughly. The Commission is ready to support EU action to press the issue of the human rights situation in general, and of the ISA in particular, with the government of Malaysia on all appropriate occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, like Parliament, is deeply disturbed by the ever-worsening humanitarian and political situation in Afghanistan. On the humanitarian front, the Commission continues, together with other partners, to provide assistance to vulnerable groups and populations inside Afghanistan and to refugees in neighbouring countries. This assistance is given throughout the country to areas of greatest need, where access and security permit. This is in line with the EU common position on Afghanistan, which sets the objective of providing effective humanitarian aid on the basis of an impartial needs assessment. Commission representatives regularly take part in field visits and assessment missions inside Afghanistan in order to see conditions at first hand and to ensure that aid can be directed towards the areas of greatest need.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political front, Commission representatives, acting as part of the EU troika, have sought to persuade the two factions in the current conflict to promote a peaceful solution. The EU troika, consisting of its ambassadorial representatives based in Islamabad, recently visited Kandahar and Faizabad to explain the EU's common position on the Taleban side. They noted a reluctance to consider new peace initiatives. The EU, with other partners, is currently looking at how best to promote a process of engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things are clear concerning the future of Afghanistan. First, outside involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan can only prolong the fighting. This applies to the support given to either side by third countries, which are pursuing their own agendas and their own national interests. Secondly, a military solution to the Afghan imbroglio is not possible. The history of the country shows clearly that no one faction can ever impose itself and its political and cultural philosophy on the whole country. I might reinforce that, particularly in response to what Mr Dupuis said, by drawing attention to the fact that the Commission does not provide aid to factions. It is delivered to vulnerable groups and populations according to need and where access and security conditions permit. Given that the Taleban control 90% of the territory of Afghanistan, it is obvious that much of the EC's aid will be delivered in Taleban-controlled areas.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons the EU maintains an arms embargo covering the whole of Afghanistan and continues to call for a halt to third country interference. The EU, at the same time, supports the peace efforts of the UN and stresses the need for a broad-based government in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in answer to the contribution from Mrs Fraisse, fighting between the Taliban and the forces of the Northern Alliance has reintensified after the winter lull and the Taliban can be expected to try to expel the Northern Alliance forces from the approximately 10% of Afghan territory which they currently occupy, while Northern Alliance commander Massud and his allies try to spread the conflict to areas already under Taliban control.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime the effects of the worst drought to affect the country for 30 years continue to afflict Afghans in the south, central and western regions of the country in particular. Large numbers of Afghans have been forced by fear of famine and the conflict to leave their homes and are now living in IDP camps inside Afghanistan or have crossed the borders into either Iran or Pakistan. In 2000 or 2001, an additional 500 000 internally displaced persons or refugees fled the fighting or the drought and the country is heavily dependent on food aid, much of which is supplied by the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
