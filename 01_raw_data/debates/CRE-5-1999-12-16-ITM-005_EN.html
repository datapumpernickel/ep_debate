<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE)</span></span>  . – I would like to begin on a positive note. I think we should recognise that there is now a new democratically-elected government in Indonesia and that, for the first time in 40 years, there is now a civilian defence minister. Therefore, we should, as the international community, be seeking to support that democratic government in Indonesia. However, in the same week as we gave Mr Gusmão the Sakharov Prize, we must be careful not to drop our guard too far. We must consider that although there is a civilian defence minister in Indonesia, the defence ministry is still heavily militarised. Clearly we would want to see greater democratisation of the defence ministry in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also recognise that there is still considerable abuse by the armed forces against those who wish to express a desire for autonomy in parts of Indonesia. Clearly while that persecution is going on by the Indonesian military we would not also be wanting to support that or give any message of support.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that in West Timor, the Indonesian military have not disarmed or disbanded the militias yet. They are still terrorising something like 200 000 East Timorese refugees who are trapped in West Timor. They are obstructing UN efforts in order to repatriate these people to East Timor. We want to see those militias disarmed and disbanded as soon as possible. We also know that the Indonesian military are opposed to cooperating with the UN International Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate crimes against humanity in East Timor. We want to see the Indonesian military cooperate fully with UN investigations. For that reason the EU should be extending its four-month old arms embargo on arms sales to Indonesia because if we were to lift that arms embargo the signal we would give to the military is very clearly that they are acceptable and have been rehabilitated, whereas, as I have just outlined, that is far from being the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise there is a strong argument for saying that if we do not provide arms to Indonesia they will go elsewhere to buy them, to China or to Russia, for example. Nonetheless, it is important for us to make a clear statement that we want to see reform of the Indonesia military. We want to see greater civilian and democratic control and we want to see greater respect for human rights in Indonesia. That has not yet happened and now is not the time to lift the arms embargo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we should have instead is an extension of that arms embargo. It would be definitely unacceptable to lift it. The army have failed miserably to disarm and disband the militia. They have been terrorising between a hundred and two hundred thousand refugees in West Timor. They are not allowing aid workers into the camps. In one camp 160 have died. 90% of those were children under five. As has already been said, they are not cooperating with the UN International Commission for Crimes Against Humanity and they are also committing crimes and atrocities in Aceh and West Papua. One case I heard of recently was that the police and the army together beat up a young man. He was going to look for his mother. They beat him up and interrogated him and kicked him to the ground. After that they poured gasoline over him and burnt him alive. That was in North Aceh. It is still happening. The Indonesian Army and the militia and the police are still committing these atrocities. To raise the embargo would give totally wrong signals.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard also recently about a secret defence intelligence report from Australia. Some of the EU countries did not want to agree to the ban in the first place. Some EU Member States put financial gain above human rights and I do not believe that that is acceptable. While the Indonesian army is still engaged in acts of repression, the embargo must stay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, having weighed up the pros and cons, that the right decision is to maintain the embargo. This allows us to send out two different signals. First, we want to bolster the development of democracy in Indonesia. It has, without doubt, maintained momentum with the democratic change of power in Indonesia and we want to and we must encourage the democratic forces in Indonesia. We must also recognise that the role of the army continues to be highly problematic, to put it mildly. There have been atrocities not only in East Timor, which is now to gain independence, but also in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do is make it clear to the army that it is now being closely watched by the public worldwide, especially in the EU, and that we take the liberty of drawing our conclusions from the behaviour of the military. At the moment, these conclusions must be that we are not prepared to supply this military with any more weapons, irrespective of whether or not the fear that they will now obtain these weapons from China is justified. We, in all events, should not render ourselves guilty of this arms supply. I therefore advocate, after careful consideration, that we vote to maintain this embargo, because it is a signal to the army in Indonesia and we hope that it is also a signal to the democratic forces in Indonesia which, we may assume, will be encouraged by our stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been said already, it would be completely unacceptable that the arms embargo be lifted, especially in the light of the fact that the Indonesian military have failed to disarm.</p>
<p class="contents">We should send out a signal that what they are doing is unacceptable. The only justification for lifting the arms embargo would be in the interests of profit. Many Member States of the European Union have a lot to answer for as regards their own support in the past for the Indonesian authority while it was oppressing the people of East Timor, and also for the fact that these countries and their arms manufacturing firms have made huge profits at the expense of innocent lives and the wellbeing of people and the right of people to live freely without oppression and human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in East Timor as regards the aid workers is unacceptable. What the Indonesian authorities are doing there has to be challenged. As Mrs Lynne has already said, it is not acceptable that the aid workers do not have access to the camps where people are dying. We stood idly by for too long after the referendum. We should have done something long before. The signal was already there. Despite our past failure to ensure that people were not killed, the onus is now on us to ensure that in future no message of support goes out to the Indonesian authorities as it stands. They are showing contempt for the wish and will of the international community as regards the right of people to live in peace, the right of people not to be oppressed, the right of people not to be killed with weapons made by western countries. If China is going to supply weapons to Indonesia that does not justify the European Union lifting its arms embargo. Two wrongs do not make a right.</p>
<p class="contents">What we should also be doing is challenging the fact that China may in fact provide arms. This is also unacceptable. China gets away with a huge amount of wrong-doing and it is about time we stood up to them as well. A clear signal has to go out to the Indonesian authorities that we are no longer going to accept their contempt for the wish of the international community for human rights and peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The search for new paths, marked out by the universal values that characterise constitutional States, that is being led by Mr Wahid’s government deserves the appreciation of the international community. </p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless too early to assess how well their intentions will succeed. There are fundamental questions that still need to be answered. How is Indonesia going to address the problems of Aceh, the Moluccas and West Papua? How will it resolve the problem of the Timorese refugees who are now just currency in the hands of pro-Indonesian militias? What will be their attitude towards the crimes committed by Indonesian soldiers in East Timor, where they were the occupying force, as well as in some Indonesian provinces? What role will the Indonesian armed forces play? Will they be able to adapt to a constitutional state or will they continue to be a force within a force? </p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the relationship between the European Union and its Member States with the Republic of Indonesia at the moment, the only sensible course of action is to uphold the decisions of the Council of 16 and 17 October, when restrictions were established that included a ban on the sale of weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, since his official appointment over one and a half months ago, President Wahid has already made fifteen foreign visits. However, the Indonesian Head of State did not visit a single one of the many acute hotspots at home until earlier this week. Moreover, the national political elite had to make a detour in Ambon in order to reach the civil governor’s residence by warship. It seems that President Wahid travels more safely abroad than in his own archipelago – a fateful sign!</p>
<p class="contents">Such an impossible situation requires political decisiveness. After all, we know what the consequences were: an estimated seven hundred casualties on the Moluccas this year alone. Add to this more than one thousand victims on East Timor, and this is not taking into account the massive unrest and bloodshed in Aceh, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya.</p>
<p class="contents">We could reasonably expect the new Indonesian government to take action in three fundamental areas: restoring public order, prosecuting and punishing those who have blood on their hands and entering into a political dialogue with the opposition. After all, blunt military repression of opposition forces only leads to a nigh hopeless spiral of violence. </p>
<p class="contents">The present resolution thus makes an emphatic appeal to the Indonesian authorities. This is why we gladly subscribe to the resolution. </p>
<p class="contents"> We have since received reports that one of the key culprits of the East Timorese tragedy, the militia leader Tavares, has suddenly decided to disband the murderous gangs and wishes to walk the path of reconciliation. The timing of this ‘U-turn’ seems highly suspect. Indeed, today sees the start of the International Donor Conference for East Timor in Japan. Surely the looters of yesterday could not be the subsidisers of tomorrow! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes this debate with open arms, as it does the contributions made to this debate so far, for they demonstrate that the European Union is conscious of the responsibility it has for developments in Indonesia and that it wants to continue in its endeavours to bring about a stable and democratic order there. This is the principle on which our policy is based and nothing will change in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I quite agree with those who have pointed out that, all problems aside, there have also been some extremely positive developments in Indonesia, which are deserving of support. The new government has been democratically elected. It appears to be committed to tackling the urgent problems. It is endeavouring to resolve the aforementioned regional unrest in Aceh and Irian Jaya and the ethnic tensions in the Moluccas, by means of peaceful dialogue and constitutional reform, and I believe it is crucially important that there is a national commission on human rights that is dealing with human rights issues. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, it will only be possible to tackle regional tensions and demands for more autonomy or for independence if a regime, a system, is introduced in Indonesia, that truly guarantees unambiguous political accountability and transparency of statecraft, and lives up to the expectations of the large, democratically-minded majority of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that there are still huge challenges to be met in Indonesia. Firstly, I might mention the fact that the army needs to be reformed, secondly that a stable system of law and order needs to be introduced. Continuing in that vein, there is a need to put a stop to corruption, to resolve the social problems arising from the economic crisis in Asia and to give renewed impetus to the badly affected Indonesian economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to make a few further remarks on East Timor in this connection, and then I also want to say something about the arms embargo. I believe that reconstruction in East Timor presents the international community with a very special challenge. Timor stands out on account of the scale of damage and violence and the singular political situation there. That is why we want to, and must, help achieve a comprehensive solution to the problems there, under the auspices of the United Nations. Then there is also the question as to how this state is to be constructed and how human rights are to be secured there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already involved itself here and will continue to involve itself. Supporting East Timor is a high-priority task as far as we are concerned. This was illustrated by Mr Nielson’s visit to East and West Timor a few weeks ago. So far, the Commission has made a total of EUR 33.5 million available for humanitarian aid and reconstruction measures. The Commission is also to participate in the Donor Conference due to take place in Tokyo tomorrow and which has already been mentioned here. A concrete programme is to be decided on there. The Commission intends to see to it that technical assistance is provided in Dili, with a view to ensuring effective implementation of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we need to do in the very near future in East Timor is to implement the necessary humanitarian measures efficiently. The repatriation of refugees has begun. The Indonesian government has assured us that the voluntary repatriation process will soon be concluded. We intend to keep a very watchful eye on this and, if we detect any hold-ups, then we will bring pressure to bear on the Indonesian government.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, it is up to the United Nations to take the leading role in coordinating all the donors’ endeavours. That is why the Commission believes that all donors should work closely with UNTAET. The East Timorese should play a part in all aspects of the reconstruction and development process. The Commission believes that the advisory council, which also contains representatives of various political groupings, has an important role to play. And so, all in all, although there are positive signs in Indonesia and East Timor, still there is cause for concern and unease. It is for this very reason that the European Parliament considers this debate to be a necessary one and this is completely in line with the Commission’s intentions and deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that the Council has sole responsibility for the arms embargo issue, which has been discussed on a number of occasions here. Consequently, I only have a certain amount of room for manoeuvre where this is concerned, but I believe that I can say this much: the Commission hopes that the Members of the Council will not only be notified of the arguments that have been presented here but also act on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
