Ten years ago, the European Commission estimated that the lives of a quarter of our citizens were disrupted by it. These days, the European Environmental Agency notes that thirty percent of Europeans suffer from noise pollution. That is an increase of twenty percent over a ten-year period. In my own country, the Netherlands, the number of people burdened by noise is as high as forty-three percent. More than ten million citizens in Europe have sleeping disorders. All citizens in Europe are entitled to the same protection against unhealthy noise levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, our Environment Ministers do not share our opinion. Unfortunately, the Council has not backed the proposal of the huge majority of the European Parliament at first reading to establish four daughter directives. These daughter directives pertain to motorways, air traffic, railways and factories.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes four daughter directives yet again. What the European Parliament wants is an all-round approach. The intention is to reduce aircraft noise at European level and to prescribe the same noise standards around busy airports in order to protect our citizens. To bring down the noise of lorries and cars at European level and prescribe the same noise standards along busy roads. To curb the noise of trains at European level and prescribe the same noise standard along busy railway lines. To decrease noise in factories and ensure that only a small proportion of this noise penetrates into the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has adopted the same opinion as the Dutch Environment Minister, Mr Jan Pronk, namely that noise is only a localised problem. Our Environment Ministers expose our citizens to increasing levels of noise. With regard to noise generated by road traffic, aircraft and trains, the Environment Ministers propose only a weak declaration but no binding legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now only a few European noise standards in place which relate to, for example, household appliances, lawnmowers and high-speed links. We desperately need European noise standards pertaining to aircraft. Far greater steps are possible technically speaking, and Europe must render these compulsory. European standards for lorries and cars are either non-existent or far too weak. The tyre directive is a case in point. Low-noise tyres may be available on the European market, but they are not yet a compulsory requirement. By means of low-noise asphalt, an enormous noise reduction of ten to thirteen decibels can be achieved. These technical advances must be incorporated in European policy. In addition to European standards for high-speed trains, we also need standards for ordinary passenger trains and for goods trains.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council did agree to harmonising the measurement and calculation of noise. There are currently fifty-one different methods used in Europe. These are reduced to two by means of the same directive: Lden and Lnight. Unfortunately, the Council dropped a few stitches in the process. The Environmental Committee has offered to pick those up. Similarly, most members of the Environment Committee have dropped a few minor stitches.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Group of the Greens, in tandem with the Socialist Group, is tabling four extra amendments. Somewhat less high noise levels should also be measured. The European Commission shares that opinion, and I invite the Commissioner to confirm this in public. The common position states that the goal of the action campaigns is to mitigate noise. In plain English, this means noise screens and double-glazing. But that is not enough. The action campaigns must also aim to reduce noise.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the Environmental Committee have adopted the Council’s position that a Member State must be able to establish its own noise indicator Lden. That means that measurements no longer need to be harmonised but that the extra protection of the night can be reduced by a factor of ten, namely from eight to six hours. That is pandering to the lobby and has nothing to do with the cultural discrepancies that exist between our peoples. Precisely that eight-hour period of sleep is essential to everyone. That is why we have tabled another common amendment in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on all my fellow MEPs to give this matter some more thought, and not to allow themselves to be used by the lobbies on Wednesday but to give priority to the health protection of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, environmental noise is a very old problem that for a long time, has not in fact been taken seriously. But it is a problem which is affecting many European citizens on a daily basis. Furthermore, the economic damage it incurs is enormous, running into the tens of billions of euros annually. I therefore welcome the proposed directive with open arms and certainly also embrace the rapporteur’s suggestions to turn it into a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much debate about the directive in this House, and unfortunately I have recently doubted on occasion whether all those taking part in the debate had actually read the proposal properly. Indeed, and I will repeat it once again, this is not about laying down the same noise standards in Europe. It is true that Europe boasts great cultural diversity, which means that what is experienced as disturbing in one country is not necessarily considered to be troublesome in another Member State. I do not want to go into that diversity, for that is not what today’s debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is it about? It is about measuring noise. That should be done in a uniform way across the European Union. For that purpose, a formula will need to be established on the basis of which maps can then be drafted. The population will subsequently need to be informed of what would come under noise pollution. On the basis of that information, which is measured everywhere in Europe in the same way on the basis of the same formulas, action campaigns can then be developed at local level. I therefore repeat once again, and I would like to cite the European Commission in its explanatory statement, it is not the intention to establish limiting values which apply to the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What we will need to do, however, is to avoid situations we have at the moment, for example, in my own living environment. For surely it is unacceptable that in one part of Europe, my region of Maastricht, an airport is not allowed to expand, while less than thirty kilometres down the road, in Belgium, based on more flexible requirements, a new airport is being opened without the slightest problem. The population has everything to do with this. In my opinion, ‘shopping’ distorts the market and should be prevented by the European airline companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Measuring methods are harmonised on the basis of a formula which takes into account – and that is something that needs to be explained to my fellow MEPs once again – the differences between ‘day’ and ‘night’, the population density, but also the cultural diversity, which means that in Portugal or Spain, different ‘day’ and ‘night’ hours can be established. The people in the south worry about the disturbance of the pace of life, but that is not a constant.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express a personal opinion on one other point. All the other opinions I have expressed were on behalf of the group. A great deal has been said about whether military airbases should or should not fall within the scope of the directive. Although that aspect has meanwhile been removed from the directive, it has been revived by the rapporteur. What I need to get off my chest – and I cannot explain it in any other way – is that I believe that military airbases should also be measured. Especially in this day and age, everyone is of the opinion that military aviation should be given free rein. I, too, am in favour of this, but that does not mean that they should not be subject to measurement. That has nothing to do with offering slots.</p>
<p class="contents">Most proposals have been re-instated from the original Commission proposal. That should in itself not be problematic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most contentious points, namely environmental noise around airports and also military airbases, are no longer on the table at this reading. The Joint Statement lags behind the precise formulations of the Commission's proposal, but a long way behind Parliament's requirements for the European noise abatement policy. For example, the Joint Statement has deleted all the fixed dates indicating the deadlines from which the noise maps have to be worked out and approved. The same applies to the action plans. My group therefore considers that all amendments which reintroduce these precise dates should be agreed and accepted as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Information is another point. Amendment No 22 says that the Member States must ensure that the noise maps and action plans are posted on the Internet two months at the latest after being approved. We think this is very important. I believe that we can have general debates about how we bring Europe and its citizens closer together if we do not then shy away from very definite political proposals for putting information policy into action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view – one shared with both the speakers who preceded me – that the key question is whether any request by us for subsidiary directives will be successful. I consider it to be progress in itself that there are harmonised methods of noise measurement and common noise indicators. Such things can, though, be only the beginning. What are we to say to people if we point out the problem but take no definite steps to solve it? I believe that a time limit is needed here. We cannot wait indefinitely for the next steps in this field to be taken. It is for this reason that my group has joined with the Greens in signing the request for such subsidiary directives to be presented within three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I suspect that made a hell of a din. Nonetheless the impression is that our society has become noisier with more machinery, hi-fis and stereos, planes, trains and, above all, motorways. I am all in favour of cutting noise and making life more pleasant, peaceful and calm.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission's proposals for common measurements so that we all know what we are looking at and what we are hearing across the European Union. I support the idea of noise mapping and I support legislation under single market rules to introduce limits on noise from new equipment being introduced and sold throughout the European Union. But I am opposed to the Union seeking noise limits on installations in any individual Member State. I do so, as I have argued strongly in committee, on the grounds of subsidiarity, in the belief that decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level.</p>
<p class="contents">In almost every case in the Committee on the Environment, we deal with issues which should rightly be dealt with at European Union level, because they concern matters which affect more than one Member State – transboundary issues. But today I arrived in Parliament, I opened my window in the office in the Tower and I could not hear Strasbourg airport, I could not even hear the railway. All I could hear was someone shouting down in the courtyard. I do not regard noise from airports as a transboundary issue and I am pleased that the committee rejected a number of the amendments which were tabled. I will be urging my group to reject Amendment No 34 here because it still implies that noise limits should be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Roo commented on Amendment No 36 that the eight-hour sleep limit is essential for everyone. That may be the case. It may also be the case that a cup of cocoa and a bedtime story are essential for everyone but this is not something which should be done at EU level. We should not be setting standards for these things. What is fascinating about this debate, as it was in committee and here now, is that for the best possible reasons – the improvement of health and enhancing the environment – measures have been suggested to us which represent a sort of creeping centralisation which, at the end of the day, makes the European Union seem bossy and interfering to far too many of our constituents. We should take this opportunity, and indeed every opportunity, to put into practice our belief that wherever possible we should be applying strictly the principles of subsidiarity and making sure that when we take measures on behalf of the environment at European Union level it is because they will genuinely make a difference to individuals and cannot be done by individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, that is quite a different story for noise pollution. I am pleased that I, in the Netherlands, am not affected by the noise produced in Milan or Athens. In other words, noise pollution is a local, or regional, problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market justifies environmental policy at European level, in order to promote fair competition. This means, therefore, that European requirements can be prescribed for the safety and environmental friendliness of products and processes. Clear examples of products are emission requirements for cars, lorries and machinery, while waste incineration and energy generation typify processes.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to fair competition, European noise standards can also be prescribed for products, such as cars, motorcycles, lorries, machinery, trains and aircraft. This is not appropriate for processes since the effects do not transcend borders. In other words, I am in favour of European standards for low-noise tyres but am opposed to the requirement that the cobblestones be removed from the streets in Brussels on account of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has already taken things very far in the environmental noise directive. Parliament’s amendments, however, go even further, and I cannot back most of these as a result. In addition, I cannot see the additional benefit a European noise pollution map would afford. The Member States can map out noise pollution themselves if they so wish. Moreover, if such a map were to exist already, I would still be opposed to a European policy on environmental noise.</p>
<p class="contents">A separate problem is aircraft noise. Last week, I attended the ICAO Conference in Montreal on behalf of the European Parliament. Unfortunately, it appeared that outside European, there is little support for stricter noise standards for aircraft. Stricter noise standards for airfields are also a moot point. Nevertheless, I remain of the opinion that airfield authorities must be able to pursue a powerful policy of their own by refusing large noise-makers. Noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem for people who live near the airports. In principle, this problem should therefore be solved locally, that is to say by the competent airport authority. In various airports, this is already the case in that flight bans are issued for the noisiest aircraft or for certain night flights. The disadvantage in this respect is that the problem could be transferred elsewhere. In addition, airports in border regions can cause extra problems. The latter must be solved mutually by the relevant Member States. In this matter, I should also add that we must not inflate the issue. If I want to fly to Strasbourg, I do not drive to Rome first because, due to competitive advantages, the flights there are cheaper than from Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the aircraft themselves, the problem is not that major technically speaking. Thanks to modern technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which produce six times less noise than aircraft built thirty years ago. Since the life of aircraft is about thirty years, the effects of these technical improvements, however, are taking a long time to kick in. The question is whether this long wait is desirable. I do not think so. If we really want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements must be carried out more quickly. The extra cost this entails obviously falls to the traveller who must be fully aware of the actual cost of flying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Davies and Mr Blokland, if I were from your countries of origin, I too would adduce the argument from subsidiarity, but, my dear Mr Blokland, I know only two airports in the Netherlands whose flight paths, however, are located above my constituency. All this is relative, and so I believe that we here must talk about whether we can find an air corridor to serve as a model for the compilation of fundamental criteria, and I believe that our views on noise maps are by no means so divergent. I advocate comparable rules of measurement within the European Union as a matter of principle, and I also believe it to be self-evident that the action plans we arrive at on the basis of these measurements must be drawn up by the member countries, which must also implement and supervise them.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a great interest in the question, at what actual point such a regulatory mechanism takes effect, and here the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has without any doubt gone too far. One could get the idea from reading the Committee on the Environment's text that, in future, every country lane will have to have its own noise map. The wording is doubtless much too vague, and what the Council proposes is quite simply boring. If you are only to draw up such a noise map when the figure of six million cars per annum is reached, then I suggest you abandon the whole operation. So, in my view, a good mean value would be a good solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the measurement of noise from railway lines is concerned, it would have been good if we could have had another parameter for this, as noise from railways is perceived differently to that from motorways or airports. Unfortunately, that idea foundered at the committee stage, something which I particularly regret.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to contradict Mrs Ria Oomen, whom I otherwise greatly respect, by saying that I think it almost courageous to state the belief that politicians like us, who concern ourselves with the environment, can decide in an environmental directive whether military pilots fly or not. Quite apart from the present situation, this Parliament does not have the right to regulate the times of practice flights by the French or the British. I believe that military aviation should have no place in this directive and nor will it find its way into it. In other respects, I believe this debate to have been basically necessary. I wish we could take this document to the Conciliation Committee; then, Mr de Roo, we would get away from your rather exaggerated demands and arrive at realistic ones that would get us somewhere in the overall scheme of things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not, then, about ruling on what measures in terms of military tactics should be under discussion, but only about arranging flights in the context of a noise indicator and an action plan in such a way that overall noise does not exceed the level tolerable by individuals. I believe that we should steer our joint efforts towards finding out what people find acceptable or intolerable and decide on that basis what steps to take. There is a need for more research on this. It has, for example, not yet been ascertained whether an average noise level is dangerous, or individual very high levels. We therefore need even more understanding of causes, effects and connections. Hence, too, our demand that we should not immediately announce a framework directive to which we attach specified noise indicators and limit values. Rather, we should say that we want to obtain the land registers first and then, in three years' time, to adopt appropriate subsidiary directives with quality standards for noise policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and in my view this is at least as important – we should also be carefully re-examining individual noise emission sources in order to find out how, at European level – and perhaps more quickly and more effectively than by means of local action plans – we might achieve a reduction in the noise from aircraft and motor vehicles caused, for example, by their tyres. So we also need noise reduction at the emission sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore it is increasing in most countries of the European Union. It is aggressive not only to the hearing but also to the whole nervous system of citizens and in many cases it alters not only the personality, through reactions such as irritability and insomnia, but it also produces pain in the auditory system.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a southern country and to tell you the truth I have very often thought: ‘Who could silence that lawnmower next door! Who could make the traffic on this street quieter! Who could stop the music coming from that discotheque on the other side of the block from reaching my windows!’ And on all those occasions when a citizen such as me has said, ‘Why is there nothing or nobody that can stop this noise?’, it should be possible for most cases to be regulated, either by the local council, the residents association or the regional authorities. In other words, at a local level rather than a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">As numerous speakers have said, realistically speaking, it seems to me that there are practically no cases in which noise, at the level most citizens suffer it, should be dealt with in a cross-border fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Airport noise has been mentioned, but it apparently affects 1.7% of the population of a country, while road traffic noise affects far more. It seems to me that to concentrate on airport noise and not deal on a local level with road traffic, in particular, is a rather absurd form of discrimination against airports.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to go into that, however. Above all, I wanted to make it clear once again that there is a difference between the various countries of the European Union in terms of noise and perceptions of it. In this respect, Mediterranean countries are more noisy, we have a climate which allows us to be outdoors and, in this sense, eight o’clock in the evening is for us a time for socialising, to be out and to be professionally active.</p>

Noise pollution is very disturbing and can form a threat to health. Health is tied in with the environment and with the way in which we pollute the environment. The Sixth Environmental Action Programme is right to devote much attention to this aspect. This attention must lead to specific measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principle is to reduce noise to a level at which it does not threaten public health. In this connection, the guidelines and opinions of the World Health Organisation should be taken into consideration. Noise pollution is local and certainly does not transcend borders. Solutions must be found by local, regional and national administrators. We should be careful not to regulate too much at EU level. Excessive ruling from Brussels is in most countries not appreciated – with good reason – but in few cases, European attention is certainly justified.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Europe must step in when the noise source exceeds limits, for example in the form of products. There are already European rules in place for noise pollution, for example pertaining to the noise standards for lawnmowers. Noise emission standards for certain products, such as cars, pleasure boats, lorries, trains, aircraft and industrial equipment are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason for European intervention is the making available of reliable and verifiable data. The European Parliament pointed at the lack of data on various sources of noise a long time ago, and a common method must be found for measuring and assessing noise. And this forms the very essence of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, general principles must be formulated, such as: the polluter, or noise-maker, pays. This kind of principle must be transposed in our legislation. Citizens must – and that is, in fact, the most important point, in my opinion – have clear rights. In the case of serious complaints about noise pollution, the right to investigation should exist and, if necessary, action should be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am however, rather surprised. We are simply asking Europe to compensate for errors in land use planning that have been made in all of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, should we appeal to Europe, since each Member State can decide for itself what it should do on its own territory?</p>
<p class="contents">We have already adopted measures on tyres and aircraft engines and we can do the same for road surfaces. This is indeed a huge task, but why should we lay down regulations which, in reality, concern not only Member States but must also take account of differences between these countries and, above all, encourage local authorities to adopt the necessary measures in line with their local situation rather than us deciding for them? This is the principle of subsidiarity and I am particularly keen to see it implemented in this area. Locally elected representatives are responsible for deciding on what needs to be done in each town, county or region. These are decisions for locally elected representatives. I am one of them and I know very well what is involved in drawing up a strategic noise map.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told about airports, for example. There are international airports, and there are national airports and there are considerable differences between airports. The impact of noise is, therefore, different. Why, then, should we impose standards that will not apply to all of them? It should not be forgotten that airports are crucial to the areas in which they are located. Infrastructures for air transport are a crucial factor for industries, which often choose where to base themselves on the basis of communications links and airports. Is it worth emphasising that an exception absolutely must be made for military airports? I agree with Mr Florenz. The current situation clearly shows the importance of this provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by reminding you that the title of this directive is ‘Assessment and Management of Noise’. Management is, therefore, preceded by an assessment. How can we attempt to set limits without a detailed and wide-ranging study, based on commonly established assessment criteria? We would need to have precise maps on noise and then ask every Member State to implement effective action plans. It is also crucial that we involve the public in these exercises, although this can only be done with the agreement of each country and each local authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are currently at second reading and we need to focus on the main issues, as set out by the rapporteur.

I therefore agree with the ambitious options proposed by the rapporteur, Alexander de Roo, and I congratulate him on his work. I supported his report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I support it again now.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight a few aspects in particular. Firstly, I agree with the idea of transforming this directive into a binding framework directive to be followed by specific directives on noise caused by cars, motorcycles, trains and aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also agree with setting common noise limits in the areas surrounding all of the European Union’s civilian airports. Not only because the noise caused by night-time air traffic is more responsible than any other for depriving the general public of sleep, but also because, as a result of the lack of common regulations in the European Union, we have seen terrible distortions of competition between airports and a lack of fairness towards the citizens of the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome the amendments proposed for the joint position on noise indicators. With these amendments, the Member States can move up to two hours of the evening schedule to the daytime or night-time period, which will enable legislation on noise to be implemented without this affecting the habits and traditions of each country, especially, those of southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This new legislation must be implemented as rapidly as possible, but in order to ensure that it is complied with, Member States need to invest very quickly in the technical and human resources that are essential to monitoring and supervising its implementation.

Health problems and unpleasant experiences of noise are, however, both very individual matters, which makes the issue of noise a difficult one. For example, living next to a shooting range, with the type of noise produced there, may be a very unpleasant experience even if the range is rarely in use. Some people find low-frequency noise and its vibrations very unpleasant. I am convinced that we need more research into the problem of noise, and more knowledge about it.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main reasons why the Europe we share is so fascinating is the many differences there are in our part of the world. Variations in the European landscape and countryside are examples of this. The level of settlement varies according to whether we are talking about heavily populated areas in Central Europe, such as in the Netherlands, or sparsely populated areas in northern Europe such as are to be found in Sweden and Finland. That is something we must consider when we take measures to combat the problems caused by noise. Aircraft, cars and trains move between different countries and environments. It is therefore only right that they should comply with common provisions concerning noise. However, industrial areas and airports are fixed installations, and their environments vary considerably. That is why it is important that we should not become bogged down in future legislation on noise consisting of measures standardised from the perspective of Central European population centres. Noise regulations must allow flexibility. Local and national authorities are better placed to take account of environmental factors in the case of permanent sources of noise.</p>
<p class="contents">We must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and draw up anti-noise regulations that it is possible to apply throughout the EU without there being unreasonable local consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is happening in the case of noise. In truth, noise and the activities which create noise – there is nothing more horrendous than a machine digging a hole in the street, and not allowing us to live – are mostly subsidiary. They come within the competence of local authorities, and it is therefore very difficult to get different towns to agree, for example, on closing times for bars, because they all want to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite this, I believe that this directive is guilty of wanting to homogenise all of us and I believe that is contrary to the idea of cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I often say that, in Mediterranean time, the day has 30 hours, while in the Northern countries it has 24. But in our time the day has 30 hours because time is elastic: the grandmother goes to bed at 10 and the grandchild, on the same day, goes to bed at 5 in the morning and the following day everything works fine because time is miraculous, it is flexible, as flexible as society wants it to be. It is therefore practically impossible to reduce all of this to mathematics. I would even go as far as to say that it would reduce the European Union’s authority if the people thought that their own world was going to be subject to these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would remind you again that we are facing the serious problem of town and country planning. There is no point in trying to pacify wild animals by playing music. We must deal directly with the problem and that is town and country planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I do not agree with some amendments, such as the one which deals with competition. What does competition have to do with noise at airports? Do we compete in terms of geography? Do we compete if we are great distances apart, if we have different climates, if we have different conditions? We could also say that we should all have the same number of hours of sun, but we do not.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we must be prudent and culturally-aware, we must understand diversity and understand that people visit the South, amongst other things, because they have more fun and they can stay out very late at night on a terrace listening to music. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed it is to be welcomed. I also welcome the recent decision of the Committee on the Environment to restate that this draft directive should be strengthened into a framework directive out of which further, more detailed and specific legislation can follow, in other words, daughter directives. A one-size-fits-all policy in relation to environmental noise and the different transport sectors, not to mention differing circumstances in Member States, is not satisfactory legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention another point. I do not agree with the views of my colleague, Mr de Roo, in the specific amendments he has introduced on noise at airports and in the environs of airports in this piece of legislation. That will be for another day as far as I am concerned. I would like a response from the Commission in view of the opinion of the Advocate-General, delivered on 20 September last, on the preliminary ruling on the invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on restricting the use of aircraft at European airports in the interests of protection against noise. This regulation was based, curiously and questionably, on design criteria rather than performance criteria. I am referring to the controversial hushkits legislation, an example of how not to do something. I would appreciate a Commission response.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission indicate whether it will be proposing the repealing or amending of this regulation, because this is a most important issue. We cannot pursue design criteria, as distinct from performance criteria, which favour one jet engine manufacturer over another. That has got us into difficulties on this issue. I would appreciate persistence in pursuing the issue of Mr de Roo's amendments. In the light of what has happened with the hushkits legislation I would like a response from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, generally, I support the common position – it is a useful compromise – but I would not support going any further than that. This is useful as a framework directive but I would not like to see lots of further directives springing from it. We need to be very careful in applying the principles of subsidiarity, a view which is being widely expressed across the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure that we would have any credibility whatsoever as a Parliament or as a European Union if we started to dictate to our citizens what hours they can or cannot sleep. This is a matter that should be determined for them at a local level. If an airport, for instance, is located in the centre of a city, then the limit values that should be acceptable there are completely different to those at an airport located out on a peninsula in a quiet rural area. Why should not a particular community seek to set up an airport, for instance as a cargo hub, that can experience noise pollution in excess of what a large city should produce? This is a matter for local authorities and for national governments and should not be a matter for this Parliament and for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask those people who wanted to include military aircraft and military airfields within the scope of this directive, whether they are really saying, as Europe is, at the moment, in a state of war, that our airforces cannot operate at night or with planes that are too noisy, that they cannot defend our freedoms against terrorist attacks if their aircraft are too noisy. I suggest that if that proposal is being made seriously, it would be laughed out of court across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of legislation laying down noise limits for specific projects, but we really are going far too far in many aspects of the amendments proposed in this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all I should say that we are not trying by any means to suggest that people across Europe should go to bed at a certain time or laugh in certain places only, or to harmonise any of the different customs and cultural traditions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive on the table today, following on from our 1996 Green Paper, aims to develop a new noise policy to tackle noise which affects people, and not only noise from individual sources. This will be done by drawing up harmonised noise maps to assess the noise exposure situation across the Community; informing the public about noise exposure and its effects; requiring authorities in Member States to develop action plans to achieve the required noise levels; and providing the European institutions with information on environmental noise, in order to assess the situation and develop further action. There are 51 different ways to measure noise, but could we not agree on the means of measuring it within the Community? That is the first step – actually drawing up these noise maps.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this last topic, I understand the concerns expressed by some Members who have tabled amendments making the case for proposals for daughter directives as of now to set new limit values for sources and environmental noise. However, the success of the innovative noise policy we wish to develop relies notably on the quality of the data we will be able to gather.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the lack of such information is obvious, notably due to the lack of harmonisation of the assessment of noise exposure within Europe. The Commission believes that it would be premature at this stage to come up with proposals setting new limit values for noise.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have a raft of market access legislation which sets limit values for different kinds of road vehicles, for example. It will be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives. We will consider what these standards need to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps and will, of course, report back to the Council and Parliament. For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendments introducing daughter directives and limit values, but we are willing to propose further actions as soon as possible, which is why we wholeheartedly accept amendments strengthening the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not concern specific sources such as aircraft engines and hushkits. The Commission has not yet had time to reflect on the ICAO decision last week, but we will of course come back as soon as we have had a chance to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the detail of the 36 amendments adopted by Parliament's Environment Committee, we are able to accept 28 of them, in full, in principle and/or in part. We can accept Amendment No 1, which alters the title, to make the proposal a Community framework for the assessment and management of environmental noise. However, as I said earlier, we believe that it would be premature to set new limit values, and thus we cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6 and 33. As for the timetable for implementation of the proposed directive, we welcome Amendments Nos 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 25, which propose restoring the dates of the original Commission proposal, and in line with these amendments we can also accept in principle Amendments Nos 15 and 16, which seek to reinstate tighter deadlines, although we would have more reservations on the deletion of the two-phase approach for roads and railways. In this respect, we cannot accept Amendment No 20.</p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments also help clarify the text, and, furthermore, we accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8, 14, 27, 28 and 29. We can accept in principle Amendment No 5, which introduces four important principles, though we would not wish other principles to be excluded. With regard to Amendment No 9, which seeks to reinstate the definition of human health, we support the first part of this amendment, while the reference to the World Health Organisation seems superfluous at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On the harmonisation of the common noise indicators, Lden and Lnight, Amendment No 11 makes the case for the compulsory use of these indicators for acoustical planning and noise zoning, while Amendment No 34 reintroduces the definition of an action plan being 'designed to reduce noise where a limit value in Lden or Lnight is exceeded'.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Council an agreement was reached to use common indicators only for the purpose of strategic noise mapping, while the need for further harmonisation of indicators was postponed for consideration in the review proposed in Article 11. Therefore, I am afraid we cannot support Amendments Nos 11 and 34. However, since the directive now limits itself to strategic noise mapping, it is logical to support the principle of Amendment No 12. Besides this, we also welcome Amendment No 36, which seeks to reduce the flexibility and the definition of the Lden noise indicator, thus making for more comparable results.</p>
<p class="contents">On public information, Amendment No 22 requires that the information to the public be published on the Internet within two months. We welcome the principle of this amendment, but the dissemination of information to the public should not be limited to the Internet. As for the review clause under Article 11 of the proposal, Amendment No 24 seeks to delete the reference to 'different climates and cultures'. Owing to strong concerns expressed in the Council by Member States, we cannot support Amendment No 24.</p>
<p class="contents">In the annexes, we can support in part Amendment No 26, which seeks to make compulsory the provision of financial information on action plans. Of the three types of financial information concerned, we would support the provision of budget information being made compulsory, while the others are more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we support Amendments Nos 30, 31, 32 and 35 to Annex VI, which partly restore the original provisions proposed by the Commission on the technical specification of strategic noise maps.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for the detailed consideration given to this proposal and the helpful amendments which have been contributed. They have undoubtedly strengthened the proposal and also improved its quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
