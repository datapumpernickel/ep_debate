<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamandouros,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Ombudsman</span>. – Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this House for the first time as European Ombudsman and to present the Ombudsman's Annual Report for 2002. The report covers the last full year in office of the first European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, who is present today and who retired in March 2003. I would like to pay tribute to his many achievements on behalf of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Foremost among Mr Söderman's achievements is the establishment of the European Ombudsman as an effective and well-known institution, promoting openness, accountability and good administration. Other important achievements include the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour approved by a resolution of this House in 2001, a procedural code for complainants under the Article 226 infringement procedure adopted by the Commission last year, and the abolition of age limits in recruitment to the institutions and bodies. As an observer at the convention that drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr Söderman successfully proposed that the Charter should include the right to good administration. As an observer at the European Convention, he succeeded in ensuring that the draft Constitution properly mentions the Ombudsman, provides a legal basis for a law on good administration and informs citizens of their right to a remedy in national courts. He also gave me vital advice and support in the establishment of the Ombudsman institution in Greece. I will try to live up to the expectations generated by his achievements and to carry on his work by maintaining and further developing the capacity of the institution to serve all Union citizens as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Report for 2002 records the progress that has been made in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making the institution better known to citizens. In 2002, the total number of complaints rose to 2211, making it the first year in the history of the European Ombudsman that the total rose above 2000. The proportion of complaints sent through the website and e-mail continued to rise. About half of the complaints received in 2002 were sent this way. In addition, over 3700 electronic requests for information were received and answered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman opened more inquiries in 2002 than ever before – 8% more than in 2001, including two own-initiative inquiries – and dealt with them more effectively. At the end of the year, I am happy to report, all but four inquiries had been closed within the one-year target. I am committed to maintaining and enhancing our service to citizens by using the resources as effectively as possible and, when needed, seeking a realistic additional level of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman also needs the cooperation of other institutions to answer complaints rapidly, fully and correctly. The 2002 Report contains many examples of cases in which institutions and bodies took prompt action to settle the matter once a complaint was made, or responded positively to the Ombudsman's proposals and recommendations. The Ombudsman also worked hard in 2002 to increase public awareness of citizens' rights to complain – to complain in ways that made a difference. We produced a 'Guide for Citizens', published in 11 languages. We issued a press release every 10 days on average and there were numerous presentations of the Ombudsman's work at seminars and meetings in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former national ombudsman I can testify that the European Ombudsman is certainly amongst the best-known ombudsman institutions in the world, and is probably <span class="italic">the</span> best known. For example, over 3000 websites now contain an active link to the European Ombudsman's site.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2002, the European Ombudsman also made essential preparations for the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and became one of the first EU institutions to reach out to citizens in the languages of the candidate countries, both on paper and electronically.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now intensifying preparations to manage the transition to handling complaints from 25 Member States as smoothly as possible. The preparations include recruitment of legal staff from the new Member States, as well as introduction of an improved computer database to assist in the management of complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Ombudsman institutions exist in all ten of the states that will join the Union next year. They are now fully integrated into the network of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the ombudsmen and similar bodies in the Member States. Cooperation through the network has been enhanced for all members, old and new. The online resources of the network now include, for example, a regular 'Ombudsman Daily News' service to members, and a lively internet forum for the exchange of information and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The main purpose of the European Ombudsman institution as I see it is to help strengthen the democratic life of the Union by promoting the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights in the existing and future Members States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as reacting to the complaints that are received, the Ombudsman should also have a proactive role in promoting democratic values, empowering citizens and widening the choices available to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Building on what has already been achieved and making full use of the possibilities offered by new technologies, I intend to work closely with the network of national and regional ombudsmen to enhance the role of non-judicial remedies, to increase the institutional presence of the Ombudsman and to reach out to all European Union citizens, old and new, to inform them of their rights under Union law and how to exercise and defend those rights. The resolution adopted by this House yesterday in the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report will greatly assist these efforts and I am very appreciative of that.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Constitution also to include a reference to the system of non-judicial remedies would be a real and visible achievement for citizens, who too often seem to be left on the sidelines of European integration. I commit myself to pursuing this goal vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Lord Stockton for his excellent report and the constructive proposals which it contains. I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, for the encouragement and support which the committee has shown and continues to show for the work of the European Ombudsman. Since taking office, I have experienced the willingness of many Union institutions and bodies to cooperate with the Ombudsman. I would especially like to mention the positive approach shown by the President of this House, Mr Cox, and by the Commissioner responsible, Mrs de Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to continuing close cooperation with all the institutions and bodies in order both to enhance the quality of the European Union's administration and to reach out to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all the Members of this august House for their confidence and offer them my full cooperation in the often unrecognised work that they perform in helping citizens who have problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stockton (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, 'top that!' is a saying in England. The Ombudsman has covered my report in as much detail as I could cover it. However, I have one or two points. It is a great pleasure to see the previous Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, in the official gallery. He was enormously helpful in the preparation of my report, as was his successor. Some of the recommendations that I make at the end under the subheading 'Where to from here?' were produced as a distillation of their wisdom, and perhaps my nerve.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a remarkable achievement by the previous Ombudsman to have placed the role so firmly in the consciousness and on the map of administration. I am very pleased to learn that after repeated requests, both by the Committee on Petitions and others, that the Commission is now considering very seriously that it will sign up to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. Mr Diamandouros has already reported to me that speed seems to be gathering and that something might be achieved by 2005. He has no doubt been cracking the whip behind the Commission very hard indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, one or two other points I would like to endorse. The investigative role of the Ombudsman in conjunction with Parliament is very important. There are frequently issues which emerge not only from a complaint or, in some cases, from a petition to the Petitions Committee, but there are more general points which need to be looked at. I would welcome an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman and an extension of cooperation, not just with the Petitions Committee, but with other areas of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also encouraging that the Ombudsman has initiated the establishment of, and continues to work with, national and regional ombudsmen. If I remember rightly, he will be holding a conference in the next couple of years in which he will be bringing the threads together so that European citizens have some commonality of approach to ombudsmen, whether at regional, national or European level. I would urge him, if possible, to have at least one member of the Petitions Committee attend that conference, so that there is continuity – a seamless approach. We all know how easy it is for matters of importance to individual citizens to fall into the gap between one department, commission or directorate and another. One of the jobs that this Parliament must do in conjunction with the Ombudsman is to ensure that those gaps are as small as possible and as few issues fall into them as we can manage.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been important in developing the relationship with the citizens of the new Member States. We forget, perhaps, how familiar we have become as citizens with many of the institutions and how familiar we are with some of the mechanisms. The figures that the Ombudsman quoted show that the European citizen has become very aware of the institutions. However, this is not necessarily the case in the new Member States. Therefore, perhaps we should concentrate our resources and our efforts into bringing their level of awareness and understanding up to that of the rest of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to thank Mr Söderman. He was unfailingly courteous to me and, on more than one occasion, showed he had not only a great grasp of his subjects but also perhaps a slightly atypical sense of humour when dealing with the results. I would like to commend this report to the House, and thank the present Ombudsman for his kind words.</p>

<p class="contents">At the beginning of April, the Commission had the opportunity to meet with the new Ombudsman and congratulate him on his election. We also wished him all possible cooperation and collaboration, and every success in his work, not least because his predecessor was a very hard act to follow. When the previous act is that hard to follow, one has to pull out all the stops; I am sure, though, that Mr Diamandouros’s performance will be a triumph.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last debate of this kind, on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2001, the Commission also had reason to congratulate Mr Söderman. On that occasion, it was for his pioneering role in setting up the European mediation system. Furthermore, I have no doubt that we will forge ahead alongside Mr Diamandouros with the same skill, initiative and impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">Like your rapporteur, the Commission can only welcome the Ombudsman’s establishment of the network of national and regional Ombudsmen, the notable improvements he has made to the speed at which complaints are processed, his contribution to the Convention and his active preparations for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the management of complaints procedures, the Commission applauds Parliament’s decision which led to European authorities adopting appropriate measures for finding a solution as soon as the problem in question had come to light, in many cases, while a mutually acceptable solution was found in many others.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here to serve the interests of citizens. For that reason, the Commission has always made every effort to cooperate with the Ombudsman on the day-to-day handling of individual complaints. It is true, however, that there are differences of opinion at times. That is understandable, though, and there is always frank and constructive discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, the Earl of Stockton, whom I would like to thank for his very positive work, referred explicitly to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. The Commission is working on this area, but we must time things carefully. The Commission’s code came into force in November 2001. Essentially, it corresponds overall to what we discussed and talked about at the time with Mr Söderman, and to what Parliament adopted. The first follow-through dossier has been produced, but not enough time has yet passed to give us a full and complete picture of how the current regulation is working, or, therefore, of how it might be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second question, moreover. The second follow-through dossier is being prepared. Although this report will cover all the institutions and should allow us to determine a common direction for all of them, we must remember that we do not yet know the results of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). If the IGC adopts the Convention’s text on this issue, we might then have a legal basis for launching an initiative promoting a common code for all the institutions, involving a codecision procedure with Parliament’s full participation. I would remind you, however, that matters as they stand are governed by Article 308 of the Treaty. Nothing more than a simple opinion – and a unanimous one at that – would thus be required of the European Parliament at the moment. With this in mind, it is important to await the final results of the IGC before taking definitive steps in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of access to documents relating to the infringement procedure, we should not lose sight of the fact that the infringement procedure is an essential part of the Commission’s toolkit for ensuring that Community law is respected. The Commission must certainly be able to carry out its investigations and communicate with the Member States with complete autonomy. If it is to exert that power, it must be allowed all the room for manœuvre it needs. The issue is thus one of balancing the need for transparency with the confidentiality required in dialogues between the Commission and the Member States. Furthermore, the case-law of the Court of Justice has established a legal framework for this issue. That framework cannot be ignored. For closed infringement procedures, however, the Commission has revised its practice. The documents may thus be accessed, in principle, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, and give him every encouragement. I can also guarantee that we in the Commission will support the new Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, as we supported his predecessor. I cannot, however, conclude my speech without giving credit where credit is due. Mr Diamandouros said a moment ago that the main purpose of the institution of European Ombudsman is to help strengthen the democratic life of the Union by promoting the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we should all thank Mr Söderman for his actions and work over all these years, because, at the head of the institution of Ombudsman, he has worked to achieve that improvement, that strengthening of the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights throughout the European Union and also in the new candidate countries, which will also be Members of our Union before long.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to welcome the new Ombudsman, who is taking on this valuable heritage. As Mrs de Palacio quite rightly said, the previous act is hard to follow, and so we now need to continue to raise the legal and cultural status and, above all, raise public awareness of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that we received proof of how wide this awareness is when, at the time of the election of a new Ombudsman, a large number of candidates were put forward to the European Parliament. Parliament then chose Mr Diamandouros, who will have our full support in the process of developing and consolidating the role of the Ombudsman. We certainly need to promote this role in the Member States – my country and many other Member States have no national ombudsman, unlike many other countries – and in the accession countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also considering giving our support to the forum initiative, proposed by the European Ombudsman and mentioned by the rapporteur, the Earl of Stockton. The forum should be open at all levels – local, regional and national – and should provide a great opportunity for communicating and exchanging opinions on the running of the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely pleased that the European Ombudsman has made another proposal too – to include among his responsibilities the enhancement of the system of non-judicial means of redress, not least in order to give substance to relations between the institutions and the citizens. What we need to do now, as I will mention again, given that I am speaking three times today, is to strengthen the bodies which defend and protect citizens’ rights. I believe that Mr Diamandouros will be able to accomplish this task. He has shown very willing and his previous experience as a national ombudsman will stand him in good stead. I would therefore like to express our thanks and our support for his future work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that the Earl of Stockton also mentioned this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been able to study the annual report for 2002. It is a fine annual report based on genuine, solid work. The tone is light, reflecting the way we are looking forward. Allow me, however, to say, with Scandinavian directness, that there are no doubt also certain problems in relations between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Ombudsman. One problem is that the Commission has not responded to some of the reports we have written in response to the Ombudsman’s special reports. That is a lacuna we ought to do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem we must get to grips with once the Intergovernmental Conference is over is the fact that the proposal for modifying the Ombudsman’s Charter has got somewhat bogged down. The proposal has not moved forward, and we have not obtained the necessary guarantees of the Ombudsman’s access to all documents. We must get our second wind once the Intergovernmental Conference has been concluded. Certainly, the Ombudsman is mentioned in the draft Constitution, but I believe there are many of us who had envisaged a still stronger position for the Ombudsman as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is something of an irony of fate that we are today discussing the report of the Ombudsman, whose job it is to combat bad administration, when the rest of the House is full of rumours about maladministration and Eurostat. These are not of course reasons for adopting a legal position on Eurostat and on what has happened, but one wonders whether the administrative relations between the various European supervisory bodies are as they should be. How was it possible for the Court of Auditors not to have found errors at Eurostat? How was it possible for OLAF’s communication to the Commission’s Secretary-General to have been so secret that the Commissioners did not receive these communications? Many issues surrounding the flow of information are raised by the Eurostat affair. I believe it would be quite excellent if the new Ombudsman could investigate the relations between the auditing and supervisory bodies and see whether they fulfil the requirements of good administration and adequate transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully respect the Ombudsman’s independence, but I nonetheless believe this could be an idea that the Ombudsman’s Office might bear in mind in its forthcoming work. I wish to congratulate our newly elected Ombudsman on his work. We know that he has already had a good effect upon our administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The comparison with a pair of scales is sometimes made when talking about the future of Europe and the future Constitution. On the one hand, the Union has to be democratic and open, and on the other hand, it has to be efficient and functional. We in Parliament have to watch over those scales and ensure that they do not tip at the expense of openness. I extend my greetings to the first European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, whose last report we are discussing today, and thank him once more, on behalf of my group, for his work over many years. He has never ceased to emphasise that transparency and openness are the cheapest means of ensuring good administration and combating fraud. I shall not embark on a discussion of the Eurostat question here: that would lead us off on too much of a tangent.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the annual reports by the Ombudsman have shown us how complaints by citizens regarding maladministration can lead to tangible improvements in the way in which the institutions work. In most cases, the institutions have reacted positively to the Ombudsman’s comments and solutions have been found to the complaints. Sometimes, however, there is reluctance on the part of the institution concerned to change bad rules and practices. In that case, the Ombudsman can go to Parliament with a special report.</p>
<p class="contents">Two matters of this kind are currently at issue. There is need of a common Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for all the institutions. Parliament decided on this on the basis of the Perry report. I still do not see why it should be so problematic, especially for the Commission, the very ones that should be setting a good example in this. Why are we waiting for the IGC when we could be taking the lead ourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">The other report, for which my colleague, Mrs Lambert, was rapporteur, concerns data protection and its use for the purposes of requiring confidentiality in matters that should actually be of a public nature. Two fundamental rights are at odds here: the right to information on the one hand, and the right to the protection of personal data on the other. I should like to ask the Commission, in this connection, how it intends to resolve this matter and the problems between our institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamandouros,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Ombudsman</span>. – Mr President, I would like to respond very briefly. Let me begin by thanking the Commissioner, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions and the Members of this House for their remarks, and particularly for their very warm words for Jacob Söderman and for the office that he built up and left behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me very quickly say, in reply to Lord Stockton, that the Ombudsman has always extended invitations to Members, and has always had series of meetings with national ombudsmen. We had a meeting in Athens in April 2003, and we will be having another meeting of national ombudsmen in The Hague in 2005. So there are regular meetings being held on a biennial basis.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Athens meeting the Chairman of the Petitions Committee, Mr Gemelli, was invited and attended and made a very valuable contribution. We intend to continue this pattern in the future as well. I also agree that it is vital that individuals feel there is someone going in to bat for them and we intend to do so and will continue to do so, as we have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the Commissioner's remarks, I would like to thank her for her kind words. In my position as Ombudsman I am very eager to work closely with the Commission in trying to promote the eventual adoption of what I would call 'a European administrative law'. I appreciate the fact that this has to be done in time so that what will come out will be applicable and will be best practice. I would urge the Commission to do this as quickly as possible. Certainly the IGC is important; we can start doing a number of things in preparation for that, so we can complete this task which would be a very welcome one. It would also complete the whole process of creating uniform administrative law as early as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Gemelli again for his remarks from which I retain the need for cooperation at all levels. It is very much my intention to work with people at the regional and local level. I have already been to Mr Gemelli's home country, I have also met with the original ombudsman and petitions committee of the Federal Republic of Germany. I have also been in Spain during the past week. Therefore, I have already visited three of the six countries in which there are a large number of regional and local ombudsmen, and I intend to continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much welcome Mr Gemelli's strong endorsement of the idea that the IGC might deem it advisable to include in Part III of the draft Constitution an explicit recognition of non-judicial means of redress to complement the judicial means which, of course, are already explicitly recognised in that particular document.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say with respect to the very important point that Mrs Thors made – and I would like to thank her again for her remarks – that I agree there is a legal vacuum and it needs to be examined. I would very much hope to be able to work with the Petitions Committee to improve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Statute also needs to be looked at again after the IGC and I will ensure that this is done. I am always on the lookout for areas where the Ombudsman may take initiatives to defend the rights of citizens. I also wish to take a judicious approach in this kind of matter; I particularly do not wish to compete with Parliament when it comes to issues which pertain to its own political competence which ought to be left to the House itself to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving that aside, I am very eager to work with Parliament in taking initiatives designed to strengthen the rights of citizens throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for these suggestions.</p>
