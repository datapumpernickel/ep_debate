<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the verge of giving our approval to the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste. On 4 December, Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee approved the agreement reached with the Council by a large majority. As the rapporteur, I am very pleased with this, and I shall explain briefly why.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two major points at issue and five minor ones. I shall begin with the minor points: firstly, the definition of packaging. I am sure you remember vividly the lobby and the debate on flower pots, CD cases, mascara containers and make-up pots. Parliament wanted to avoid a continuation of the debate on flower pots. The solution found is pragmatic: new products are not entered in the annexes, but the Commission is asked to give priority to examining, where necessary, those products that are the subject of legal controversy: CD cases, flower pots, toilet rolls and suchlike. The Council has accepted the substance of Parliament’s amendment of the basic definition of packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerned prevention, which this House saw as important. The environmental impact of packaging must be minimised. The introduction of a packaging environment indicator was the main feature of this. Parliament wants to encourage pilot projects, and its second reading amendment has been accepted almost in its entirety. This will undoubtedly be elaborated on in the debate on the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling that is already under way.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point relates to the report. The Council has accepted Parliament’s amendment concerning the scope of the Commission’s report on the implementation of the Directive almost in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns voluntary agreements. The possibility of reducing the transposition of certain provisions by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned has been fully accepted by the Council. This point is very important as far as the Netherlands, among others, is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The last of the minor points concerns the deadlines. The existing Directive on packaging and packaging waste provides for a limited postponement for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Parliament was prepared to grant a postponement from 2008 to 2010, the Council preferred 2012, and we agreed on 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">The two more difficult points concerned the amendment regarding the new Member States, and the recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Firstly, regarding the new Member States, the issue was who should establish the deadlines for these countries. Parliament wanted the Commission to present a proposal on which Parliament and the Council would then take a decision. The Council preferred to deal with this issue by means of a declaration on bilateral agreements with each acceding country on the basis of Article 57 of the Accession Treaty. Parliament strongly defended its second reading position. The result was the inclusion of a clearly worded recital in the Directive: this contains the derogation requests by the countries in question, and the final decision will be made in accordance with the appropriate legal procedures. From the point of view of Parliament, this signifies a considerable improvement on the original position of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly difficult problem concerned the implications of recent judgments of the Court of Justice for the Directive’s recovery targets. The Court’s interpretation of the concept of ‘recovery’ in recent judgments had been the subject of considerable debate. In these judgments, the Court of Justice concluded that waste incineration with energy recovery does not constitute recovery if that is not the main purpose of the operation, with the result that some Member States could unexpectedly find themselves in contravention of the Directive, either now or in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Views differed as to how to deal with the matter from a procedural point of view. Indeed, the implications of the judgments had not been addressed in either the common position or in second reading amendments by Parliament. The compromise solution finally found was to modify the relevant parts of the text of the original Directive. This made it clear that waste incinerated at incineration plants with energy recovery can count towards the targets of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, it is my opinion that our Parliament can be very pleased with this result, and, indeed, I recommend that everyone vote in favour of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow’s vote brings the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste to an end, but not the debate on the wider context of recycling, waste prevention and the use of natural resources. The debate has already begun in this House, with the discussion on the thematic strategies presented by the Commission. This agreement on the Directive on packaging and packaging waste points the way towards a new scheme in legislation. Parliament wanted to see greater emphasis on the environmental impact of the legislation and a flexible way of working. In an enlarged, more diverse Union, it will no longer be possible for all 25 Member States to set the same targets for recycling and recovery. Our debates on eco-efficiency at first reading and on the economic cost at second reading lead us almost inescapably to the conclusion that countries’ optimum recycling percentages can differ substantially, and ultimately we must go down that path, too. To do so, however, we do have to set clear recycling aims first of all; indeed, that is ultimately the objective of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aim of this legislation is sustainable development, a concept to which we need to give flesh and blood. Today, with the revised Directive, we are taking a step towards the modernisation of packaging policy. A packaging environment indicator has the potential to stimulate the use of more sustainable packaging. In the longer term, packaging does not need to be an environmental problem, but could contribute to sustainable development. Constant innovation is the best guarantee of maintaining employment in the packaging sector, and I hope that the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste makes a small contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to express my warm thanks to all the groups for their cooperation, and to say a word of thanks to the excellent conciliation team under the extremely capable leadership of Vice-President Imbeni. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would therefore like warmly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, and thank her for her work and the flexibility she has shown in order to reach this agreement. This agreement has not been at all easy because, as well as the long and controversial debates we have held in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we have been faced with additional legal problems, resulting from the judgment of the Court of Justice in relation to what is understood by ‘recovery’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank all the Members who have made valuable contributions to improving this Directive and, in particular, the chairperson of the committee, Mrs Jackson.</p>
<p class="contents">The work has truly been worth the effort, because the packaging Directive will have enormous consequences for the various economic actors involved: local councils, collection systems, companies producing packaging materials, the industry, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a particular appeal to consumers, who make up a sector which is essential to the system, to cooperate by taking all packaging to green points.</p>
<p class="contents">Re-use, recycling and recovery are three options for managing waste. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but I believe we must support all three because of what they have in common: any of them is always going to be better than depositing waste in dumps.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the concept of prevention, I believe that, without leaving it aside, we must be flexible, particularly in the case of the agri-foodstuffs industry which – let us not forget – is the biggest user of packaging, since in this field we must balance environmental objectives with the strictest possible food safety criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the packaging-producing industry is already making huge efforts to improve the design of their products for the simple reason that it means a reduction in costs and, at the end of the day, that is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Commission has acknowledged, certain Member States will have more difficulty complying with the Directive for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructures, low population density or, simply, consumer habits.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I am delighted to have participated in the search for a solution accessible to all. Portugal, Greece, Ireland and the new Member States are going to have longer time limits for complying with this directive. I am aware that some of these countries are already making huge efforts and I am sure that they will achieve the objectives set.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I trust that the problems stemming from the imprecise definition, following the judgment, of what is considered recovery will be urgently resolved for the good of everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work, we have to congratulate the Parliament for the way in which we took this all the way to conciliation and got a good result, and we now have a very ambitious package in front of us, a packaging package, which, I am afraid, is going to take some Member States a lot of time to digest.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set some very tough targets. We have recognised that this directive will enter into force in a period when we are enlarging the Union and a whole series of standards and objectives that we previously had in the group of 15 will now have to be extended to 25 Member States. Recognising that we even have weak Member States amongst the current 15, we have sensibly given derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot stand here tonight and say my own country is a shining example of progress as regards the recycling of packaging. I am afraid we have always been slow, we have always been behind the average and we are going to have to do an awful lot of very hard work in terms of building infrastructure and putting a whole range of measures in place to ensure that we achieve the objectives that we have set down in this legislation. Along with everyone else, we must do it: if we have signed up to legislation, we must accept the responsibilities of fulfilling the obligations it gives us, and that is something which I think the UK will do and all the Member States must do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise that high environmental standards must be paid for, but high environmental standards will also give us benefits. We will also, in the longer term, create a cleaner and greener environment for ourselves and for our children. I commend this package to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that targets are being set for waste recycling, but I should like to have seen some more demanding targets. In Denmark, we are already close to achieving the proposed recycling target.</p>
<p class="contents">Not even more demanding targets for the recycling of environmentally hazardous packaging are sufficient, however. All materials that are damaging to the environment and people’s health must be removed from the waste cycle and replaced by ecologically sound alternatives. Such alternatives do exist now. The waste problem does not need to become any greater than it is.</p>
<p class="contents">What I miss in the directive is reference to the rapid phasing-out of PVCs and phthalates. As long as PVCs and phthalates are used, a duty must be imposed upon them and used to pay both for the damage that has arisen through the use of PVCs and for the changeover to ecologically sound alternatives.

I welcome the outcome of the conciliation talks and I should particularly like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for her excellent work and understanding of the issues. As an Irish Member, I believe we have benefited from what has been known as ‘the Irish amendment’. It seems a long time since I tabled an amendment for a derogation – not from the targets, but from the timetable – for Ireland, Greece and Portugal and I thank colleagues for their understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us. I cannot speak for Greece or Portugal – their own Members will do that – but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries, although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough. This is a balance which I really welcome. There is nothing to stop others being more ambitious in achieving delivery. I thank you sincerely for your understanding of the Irish position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As an island nation, Ireland imports 80% of its packaging material and has a very small indigenous recycling possibility; we have a scattered population. Demographics, infrastructure, size and isolation make it very difficult for Ireland to meet the same targets and deadlines as other countries. We were way behind when this started and over the last five years have almost caught up. The extra time we have now been given will hopefully allow us not to look for special treatment after 2011, and that has to be our ambition as a country. We in Ireland must achieve these targets in terms of managing our packaging waste and waste in general. At the moment we depend too heavily on exporting our waste, because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so locally, despite a great catch-up over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The recovery issue and the judgment of the European Court of Justice really do not impact on Ireland as we have no recovery or incineration facilities at the moment and will not have for some time to come. No doubt there will be an appeal, but I support that for those countries for which it is relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Again my thanks go to the rapporteur and to all colleagues for their particular understanding. I welcome what is before us here this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like my colleague Mrs Doyle, I am glad to see the derogations agreed for Ireland and indeed also for Portugal and Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is right and just that the accession countries should have a decisive say in when they feel they can reasonably implement this directive, remembering that they have to face the implementation of so many directives and regulations in the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland we have quite recently introduced recycling and there has been a very positive response from the general public. I feel we need a well-established recycling mentality before moving on in any direction. Ireland is a net importer and 75% to 80% of our packaging is imported. We also have a limited capacity to use recycled packaging. We are not able to access the recycling markets easily and the expense involved is considerable for us.</p>
<p class="contents">We need realistic targets as regards the new directives, but the government feels that it can fully implement this directive by 2011. The European Court of Justice ruling classing incineration as disposal means that we need to find other means of meeting recovery targets, and I would like to say at this point that there is very deep concern generally among Irish citizens regarding the use of incineration. As other countries are moving away from incineration, I believe that we in the European Union need to look very carefully at the way we are moving in this particular area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission also welcomes the fact that solutions could be found for two important and difficult issues. The first is the procedure for adopting a deadline for accession states, and the second is the question of the consequences of the recent court judgment on energy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the deadline for the accession countries, a Commission proposal is under preparation. The Commission thinks that the Parliament needs to be fully involved in this important matter, therefore this proposal will be based on codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">On the consequences of the Court judgment the Commission realises that not everybody is happy with the solution of transforming the recovery target into a target for recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery. However, it would have been difficult to take Member States to court for having interpreted ‘recovery’ in the same way as most Member States and the Commission would have done until the judgment. The view taken by the co-legislators may indeed avoid a period of legal uncertainty from which no one would have benefited. However, this should not hide the fact that we need to solve the recovery issue. This must be done, not only for packaging, but also for all waste. Therefore the Commission thinks that we need to review the status of recovery in the waste framework directive. The ongoing debate on the thematic strategy on waste prevention and recycling will be an important input to such a view.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, as well as all the Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this important legislative process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
