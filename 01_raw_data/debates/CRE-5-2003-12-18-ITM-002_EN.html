The Summit was attended by around 11 000 participants and can be regarded as a multilateral success to which the European Union contributed substantially. On 12 December, the delegates adopted a Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action.</p>
<p class="contents">These documents now form the basis for a common concept of the information society in all United Nations member states, largely inspired by the European policy of an Information Society for All. The contributions made by the European Union to the various phases of the Summit preparatory process were, in every case, coordinated European positions which were developed by the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and the presidency, and were always presented in the negotiations by the Chairperson of the relevant Council on behalf of the EU-15 plus 10.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit has enabled major progress to be achieved in several areas. For the first time, the importance of the information society as a driving force for social and economic development was recognised at a World Summit. The key role played by legal and regulatory frameworks that promote competition and enable a better range of services to be provided to all citizens was recognised. The importance of solidarity in the context of combating the digital divide was recognised, along with the role of information and communications technologies (ICT) for advancing the internationally agreed development goals defined in the United Nations’ Millennium Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of Internet Government, that is, the future administrative and regulatory structures governing the Internet, a working group was set up under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General. It is open to all participants and its remit is to discuss various options which will then be presented at the second phase of the Summit in Tunis.</p>
<p class="contents">On all other points which were still open at the start of the most recent negotiations at the beginning of December, satisfactory results were achieved as well. This applies especially to the paragraphs on human rights, free access to information and the media. It also applies to the points on intellectual property, Open Source Software and the security of networks and information.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to funding, the text accepted by all participants recognises the desire of some countries to establish a voluntary Digital Solidarity Fund and the desire of others to undertake an evaluation of existing funding mechanisms and carry out a study on the efficiency and feasibility of such a fund. This work will be undertaken over the course of next year by a Task Force under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will follow up the outcomes of this World Summit and incorporate them into its own policies, especially in the development policy field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mrs Schreyer, speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen, and thank her very much for taking the opportunity to report back to us so soon on the Geneva Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I was privileged to be there as part of a small group of colleagues from Parliament. I want to congratulate both the Commission and the Italian presidency for the very active role they took. I am sorry the Italian presidency is not here today, but I had a chance to meet the Italian minister and his team, who played a crucial role in negotiating what was a very well-balanced declaration and action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on some of the lessons that I learned. As far as the European Parliament was concerned, the STOA unit, Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment group – which had led the initiative to be represented there – had its own stand, in conjunction with the Commission. We were also represented at a very important earlier conference about the role of science in the information society, so there was no doubt at all about our engagement with the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing we must reflect on is that we do not just have a political declaration, we also have an action plan and we have two years in which to make some real demonstrable progress before this summit reconvenes in Tunis. In the context of these complex multilateral discussions, that is not a very long time. We have a big challenge to show that we in the European Union and the Member States are taking seriously the need to apply and extend the benefits of information and communications technology to the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Schreyer said in the statement, the application of those tools to economic, social, health, educational and a whole range of other developments is extremely important. For me, one of the crucial lessons from Geneva – where so many developing countries showed us how they were applying information technology – is that we must develop expertise in those countries to enable them to develop projects on the ground that respond to their own particular needs, because every country starts from a different position in terms of infrastructure, economic development, learning capacity, etc. We are not looking for a one-size-fits-all solution, we are looking to disseminate our expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my particular pleas is that we focus our attention where we really can help, which is on extending and encouraging research and development capability in the developing world. We want a stronger network of computer scientists and specialists working in universities and technology institutes who are linked together by a global research network. In that way they can develop their own solutions, and also draw on a much wider learning-community to help them develop the tools that they want – the standard applications, the other ideas – and they can exchange their work with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has invested in the world's largest research network and we are already seeing it spread worldwide. We had the welcome news in Geneva that South Africa, for example, wants to join that network. So we can set an example.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns our engagement as parliamentarians. It was disappointing that the summit declaration did not make any reference to parliamentary engagement at all. I spoke at a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with parliamentarians from many countries all over the world. There was disappointment that we are not more fully engaged but a determination that we should be better engaged in the next stage of the process. I would like to see us – perhaps with assistance from Member States and the Commission – develop a proper electronic parliament focusing on these issues, so that when we go to Tunis – and I hope that more colleagues will join us for that – we will be able to engage in the political debate. This is an area where Europe has so much to offer, but the whole engagement needs to be stepped up and integrated with an overall development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Besides, this is our basic role as Members of the European Parliament: to identify the political components, the clashes, and to make provision for solutions to the economic and social problems which are caused.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens are waiting for answers for the dynamic procedures which have a dramatic influence on their life in the twenty-first century. The International Telecommunications Union took the initiative for this first world summit on the information society held in Geneva, but the UN put its stamp on it, giving mainly developing countries the chance to claim equal opportunities for their citizens and to demand a fairer information society. Creating a solidarity fund is, in my opinion, the basic demand. Internet access and mobile telephone communication requirements need to be met by 2010, so that the most remote communities in developing world villages can have real access. The action plan is very important for this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, alongside everything discussed in Geneva, we expect other important initiatives to continue, such as the World Mass Media Observatory being promoted and the new European Security Agency due to start up at the beginning of 2004. These are necessary tools in dealing with the new conditions. However, there is also a whole series of issues which need to be answered. Electronic democracy is perhaps the core issue. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we are also interested in the issues of education, health, intellectual property, security, human rights and economic and social practices. All these require their own operating framework within the digital environment. And the answers are not always easy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union needs to monitor closely and be able to be present with its opinions. I am sorry the debate is being held so long after the summit, but we must act efficiently in the future if we are to be able to express our opinion at it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, slightly ironical that the best information about what happened at the summit has appeared on the radical party’s web sites. The EU’s own web sites have contained extremely little information about this summit. What kind of information society do we live in? It is good that a summit should have been held because international cooperation is required where Internet security is concerned. We believe we achieved something to combat spam when we adopted the directive on privacy protection in electronic communications, but we have got nowhere. As I say, international cooperation is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It was good that the final document contained regulations on free competition, values, methods and the neutrality of technology, which showed that success is being achieved in Europe in creating an information society. As is usual in the case of international conferences, the action plan and the final document contain many sound pledges concerning how this is to be developed and how we can help the developing countries. An interminable number of international summits have now taken place at which we have given pledges concerning, for example, education for all and the fast track initiative within the World Bank to help children and, above all, girls to benefit from an education. In spite of this, nothing is happening. Regarding the fast track initiative within the World Bank, the developed countries have not even been able to comply with their modest pledge of slightly more than USD 300 million. After no more than a year and a half, we are over USD 100 million in arrears. When will the developing countries stop believing in what is said in these international forums?</p>
<p class="contents">Before this summit, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party stated that we cannot see Tunisia being a host country for the follow-up conference as long as it violates freedom of expression. In that respect, we are disappointed in the outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One wonders if perhaps the ultimate objective of the debate was none other than to increase the sales and profits of the information technology monopolies, in other words IBM for computers, Microsoft for software and the telecommunications companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the weight of these contradictions, it is not at all strange that the summit did not result in anything specific. Not only the proclamation of principles but also the action plan which were adopted are simple wish lists. The objective of the possibility of Internet access for half the world's population by 2015 and the objective of their all having access to radio and television by then are not supported by any measures. Similarly, the questions of economic aid or regulatory issues for the Internet were not addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem which we have to solve is not how some people, at a time when they have nothing to eat, will plant themselves down in front of a screen and stab away furiously at a keyboard. The problem is the prosperity of mankind and the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to that is peace. However, this problem will not be solved as long as the monopolies exploit the wealth of our planet for their own benefit, as long as they control information technology, as long as the imperialists massacre our fellow human beings. It will be solved through the fight of the peoples for radical, revolutionary social change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, an initiative for a World Summit on the Information Society is a good initiative. Information society means freedom, freedom of information, freedom of circulation of information, and it is there that we have a problem: a free information society that meets in Tunis to discuss the freedom of the information society is like sending a small child into a cage of lions to learn how to eat. We really must, indeed, be aware that Internet surfers are arrested in Tunisia, that people who use the Internet and who use the information society for the freedom that it offers are imprisoned in Tunisia. We are, therefore, going to be involved in a second world summit in Tunisia, but it is likely that by the time we arrive, the President, Mr Ben Ali, will have imprisoned a further two or three hundred Internet surfers to protect the information society from those making use of the freedom that it offers.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that if we do not protest – and by ‘we’ I mean the UN in this case, and the European Union – then that will be the sign that we are making a wrong move. In that case, why should we not go to China? All Internet surfers are imprisoned there too. We sell arms to the Chinese and, while we are at it, we organise a major international conference on freedom of information in China. Why not? Let us be logical. We will make the journey directly from Tunisia to China where we will shout to the people: ‘eat and be quiet, but above all do not make use of freedom of information; furthermore, this is why we want to have a major meeting in China.<span class="bold">’</span></p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this event, organised at the initiative of the UN, is partly distinguished by some Member States’ repression of NGOs. This is the case, for example, where Reporters without Borders is concerned, an organisation fighting for freedom of information. Following a request from Iran, signed by a large number of countries, Reporters without Borders was excluded from the NGOs recognised by the UN. You will see, therefore, that a commendable initiative for freedom and the information society is not enough; there also needs to be consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the European Parliament has fought to obtain a directive on the patentability of software that is radically different from the directive proposed by the Commission. We know what it means to fight to defend intellectual property and, if we want to be consistent in the process of setting up the information society, then we must fight for freedom and the protection of intellectual property. That means that when we organise something such as the Geneva Summit, it has to be more than just a<span class="bold"> </span>large<span class="bold"> </span>market enabling Microsoft or others to take over new markets throughout the world. The freedom of the information society does not mean <span class="italic">Microsoft über alles</span>. That cannot work. In this respect too, we must, clearly, take advantage of the framework offered by a multilateral organisation to develop regulations that, rightly, ensure equality for those entering, and those already within, the market.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, the European Union cannot simply attend this type of event: it should also intervene. So, when we are keeping quiet, when we cannot find the words, is when it is an issue of protecting the freedom of the information society. The information society is not simply a market. The information society also means setting up democracy and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I would like to point out that the political statement on the Summit, after months of negotiations, fortunately includes a reference to freedom of expression. Countries such as China, Cuba and other communist regimes – and I would like to apologise here to Mr Alyssandrakis, who believes that poverty is the root of all evil, but perhaps the lack of freedom also plays a role – tried, unsuccessfully, to delete this reference from the UN texts.</p>
<p class="contents">The current problem is that we have an action plan for the next two years on the basis of which tens of billions will be channelled to developing countries in order to develop the information society. Commissioner Schreyer, I believe that the European Commission should keep a watchful eye on the way these funds are used, by making their use dependent on their opening up and taking specific steps regarding the free market, democracy and fundamental rights. Otherwise, we risk continuing doing what we are currently doing: with our money, with public and private money, we are creating and financing software systems that allow dictatorial regimes and, increasingly, our countries too to censure, filter and prevent access to the information society. That is not the only thing: there is also a problem of the free market. In developing countries, the companies that run the Internet and telecommunications are generally corrupt monopolies or oligopolies that use corruption to restrict individuals’ opportunities to access the Internet and the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as we are doing, we are preparing to spend huge sums on these countries, let us make sure that these sums also go towards developing democracy and human rights. Let us make sure we raise the issue of Tunisia where a summit will take place which will be chaired, as the World Organisation Against Torture reminded us, by General Ammar, that is to say, the person formerly in charge of torture in the Tunisian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to advise Members against picking and choosing, which would leave some having to deal with awkward issues whilst others allow themselves the luxury of only speaking about plans, cooperation and the market, which we also favour and we want to promote, but not to the detriment of freedom and law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we have promoted the Internet and the liberalisation of telecommunications in Europe very intensively. Europe has taken on a leading role in the world here. I think that we must also make our contribution to the globalised process, and this contribution naturally means promoting free competition first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is the Internet, above all, that will finally enable family companies and small and medium enterprises to participate in world trade as well. We have learned that in ‘customer to customer’ services in particular – that is, business to consumer and business to business – the Internet opens up totally new opportunities. Through <span class="italic">e</span>-bay and other systems, there are now platforms where even micro-enterprises can market their products using services on the world market. We have international payment systems such as credit cards, and firms that handle financial transfers. We have international logistics companies that transport goods around the world. Due to the pressure from imports from many countries of the world – I am thinking, for example, of China, which is currently showing an 8% growth rate, compared with just 1% growth in Europe – Europe has a massive demand here. We must therefore do all we can to ensure that our companies establish a higher international export profile. It is here that a conference like this can offer opportunities to boost our involvement. It also demonstrates yet again that there is an urgent need for a WTO Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that the UN and civil society are now participating on these issues as well. Yet we – the legislative – are not involved to an adequate extent in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that for the future, it will be essential for us to participate in these international frameworks and ensure that the infrastructure we need for our small and medium enterprises in Europe is established. I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament will have a stronger Committee on External Trade in its next parliamentary term. Ultimately, we also need many more small and medium enterprises and family enterprises around the globe. We must therefore form partnerships between small enterprises around the world, offer them platforms and provide support to our 18 million – soon to be 22 million – SMEs, which employ two-thirds of Europe’s workers, so they can become global players and through them, we become successful in the global market.</p>

The World Summit on the Information Society demonstrated yet again that international negotiations, regardless of the framework in which they take place – whether it be the WTO or the UN – have become extremely complex. Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Rübig’s appeal is quite right: we need more parliamentary involvement. That will not necessarily simplify the process, but it will at least demonstrate more clearly and tangibly the desire of citizens to be represented properly through a legitimate voice.</p>
<p class="contents">In Geneva, it became apparent how such complex negotiations – in this instance, on the issue of how a global information society should be developed – can be shaped by the various actors. As a rule, these continue to be the governments, of course, and it is governments which draft the laws and have to negotiate at international level. In this instance, however, a great many companies and what has come to be known as ‘civil society’ were also involved. We must not forget that the Summit in Geneva nearly collapsed. It was extremely difficult to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at all. Anyone who reads the text and the compromise – and I would recommend it to everyone – can see how difficult it was to produce this compromise. I suspect that it will only be in Tunis that we recognise that we have a document before us that we can take back home and defend with some measure of credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention the most important issues that are at stake. Firstly, there is the issue of financing. Mr Cappato has mentioned that in the EU, we must proceed very cautiously when it comes to participating financially. We must consider which governments we are indirectly supporting, as they will have their own ideas on what constitutes an information society. Secondly, there is the issue of human rights. Here, the key issue is again freedom of information or constraints on access to the Internet. Naturally, there are many other issues as well. Cyber-security is one aspect that the European Union in particular has put on the agenda, and one where I hope we will be able to make a contribution through our own agency which we are currently setting up. Then there is the issue of Internet Governance, which is still unresolved. That is a sorry story even here in Europe. We have not even managed to launch our EU top level domain name successfully in the European arena. Finally, there are the issues of intellectual property rights and how open source can be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I felt it was important simply to mention these points. I hope that next year, we can address this topic again, and that this House will adopt a resolution on the matter before Tunis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clearly good to analyse at world level what is perhaps the best expression of globalisation, that is, a society which, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, is most characterised by our treatment and dissemination of information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has given us an excessively brief description of the results of the World Summit and we must therefore consider the issue on two levels. Firstly, within the European Union itself, given that making progress on and the use of the technologies on which the information society is based are absolutely essential to achieving the Lisbon objectives and turning the European Union into the most economically and socially advanced society by 2010. And secondly, at external level, where there are a series of elements which have been mentioned, such as intellectual property, free access to communications, security of information, digital solidarity, the use of the information society to rebalance the differing levels in the least-favoured societies, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say simply, in summary, that this World Summit has served to promote much more intensive action within the European institutions and also, obviously, to stimulate debate before the next World Summit takes place and to assess the issues raised here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is especially gratifying given that in other areas – let me cite some examples from my sphere of interest: the Alpine Convention – has mystifyingly absolved itself of much of its responsibility and has thus contributed to the stasis and paralysis of this initiative. Hopefully, the Commission will reconsider its position here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the information society, I believe that the right to network access should not only be understood as facilitating access. It should also mean promoting access, especially in outlying regions, in regions with a geographical disadvantage, that is, also in mountainous regions. The population here, which is at a disadvantage from the outset – in terms of the type of settlement, the distribution of settlements, and their remote location – should also have the opportunity to gain network access under preferential conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that a differentiated approach must be taken to the conurbations, on the one hand, and the sparsely populated regions, on the other. I would like to draw your attention to an initiative adopted by the Free State of Bavaria some years ago. This was a very interesting campaign and initiative which aimed to open up opportunities across the board. Unfortunately, these opportunities were considered to violate competition rules. However, I think that a rather more lenient approach should be adopted to the issue of competition if there are objective criteria necessitating other solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the information society must undoubtedly take greater account of various other issues, such as data protection, privacy and certainly the protection of intellectual property as well. These are aspects that have not been considered to an adequate extent in the past due to the novel character of the medium. I hope that this ground can be made up in practice as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an extremely important initiative that goes right to the very heart of the societal change that is engulfing our world at the moment. This is because technological change comes with something else: it comes with a huge transformation in the values and norms of our society and a huge transformation of our global economy. Therefore the way in which we deal with this issue politically is of vital importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The vast array of opportunities and threats raised by the information age are too various to mention in my three minutes so I shall draw some examples from my own constituency in the north-east of England. My own region has turned itself around in the last 30 years. It was once on the scrap heap of the Industrial Revolution and it is now poised to take advantage of the information age we are so speedily, but ambiguously, chasing. This age requires sound infrastructure, sound technical capacity, knowledge and content. Yet regions in our Union such as my own, let alone regions of developing countries, could be adversely affected or simply miss out on the benefits of the information age because these benefits are so unevenly distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">Because my region is seriously disadvantaged in educational terms and because our infrastructure is not yet up to the task, there is a huge way to go for us in order to be able to benefit from it enormously. I welcome both the summit and the action plan as a wake-up call to our governments. Universal access, widespread development of broadband and skilled development are fundamental to successful transition. But we must be aware that, while it is correct to have global aspirations, we have serious work to do in our own back yard. If we are all to participate in this particular game, we must create an even playing field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has completely revolutionised the management, transfer and use of information. While thousands of pages of printed paper and huge libraries and archives used to be needed for the storage of information, now the same quantity of information is stored on Internet websites and computer discs. Transfer of information used to mean a journey to the archives, copying documents and posting them off. Now the same data can be browsed on a computer from your own office or study. Sending information used to mean putting it in the post and waiting around for it to arrive; now email gets to where it is going in different parts of the world in seconds.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no limits to knowledge-based development. The EU has taken this into account in many different ways, including the Information Society for All Programme. That is why the EU’s development strategy to make our continent the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy is absolutely the right one. There are nevertheless a few conditions attached to this development.</p>
<p class="contents">A properly balanced information society cannot develop if it is merely market-driven. Society has to be involved in developing and building the infrastructure. We have to ensure that the less well-off, the young and those at risk of exclusion are able to use these services. Regionally we have to make sure that the networks also extend to the sparsely populated and peripheral regions. Proper use must be made of the EU’s Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the monopolies have to be broken. Internet connections must be made reasonably priced by also opening up the last kilometre of connectivity to real competition. We should also be able to prevent the cartelisation and monopolisation of software and applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Abuse is a separate problem. Sending spam and deliberately creating disorder and malfunctions must be made punishable.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the information society provides great opportunities to enhance spiritual, intellectual and material well-being. Accordingly, greater attention must be paid to this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome the fact that the proclamation made at the Geneva summit included the need to promote the incorporation of the gender equality dimension, in other words gender mainstreaming, in the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the proper development of new technologies is not safeguarded by the introduction of legislative and regulatory measures alone because, as we know, the financial resources available are very limited. What needed to be pointed out with greater emphasis in Geneva was the need to renew the codes of conduct governing the use and development of the information society. In other words, we are talking about digital democracy. The participation of women in it may be very important, because women are in a position to promote a different ethical dimension based on the different system of values which characterises them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, so far, in the public debate on the development and consequences of new technologies, interest has focussed mainly on the economic repercussions, ignoring the analysis which examines the issues of democracy and the gender dimension, with the result that questions of technology are erroneously interpreted as ‘neuter’ <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> democracy and <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> gender. The lack of access to new technologies and digital illiteracy are increasingly developing into new forms of social exclusion from which women are directly at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities lists the reasons which perpetuate this situation, such as social stereotypes and cultural prejudices, which limit women's options and raise barriers to their careers, resulting in more general adverse consequences on the economy from the non-rational use of human resources. Unfortunately, the summit avoided analysing in depth the social reasons which lead to the perpetuation of this phenomenon. I hope that the United Nations world summit on the information society will contribute to the public debate on the sort of information society we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, as a result, Parliament and, indeed, the other institutions were hardly represented – beyond the official statements by the Member States and the Commission – as active participants. The evaluation of the Geneva Summit and the ensuing implementation measures must now be geared towards the second phase of the Summit in Tunis in November 2005. For the first time at one of the major UN conferences, civil society groups were included as partners, and this proved very beneficial. The presentation by the developing countries, with multifaceted initiatives to overcome the digital divide, was impressive. Surprisingly, the ACP Council of Ministers produced an ACP/EU common position for signature. The basis for an implementation strategy, which I called for in my 2001 general report and which is long overdue, and which must focus on the social benefits for all sections of the population, has therefore finally been established. This must include the right to freedom of opinion. The Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action must be evaluated by the Commission and Parliament in terms of their implementability. At the same time, the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before Tunis, including how the Digital Solidarity Fund demanded by Senegal can developed in a sensible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
