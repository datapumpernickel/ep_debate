<p>The global crisis has created new needs and new priorities, both in budgetary policy and in planning the growth policies of Member States.</p>
<p>A fair number of Member States therefore need to replan programmes and actions and also the system for funding their National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSFRs).</p>
<p>Will the Commission say:</p>
<p>What proposals is it considering in order to make it easier for Member States that wish to update programmes cofunded by the European Union? Is it contemplating changes in the financial framework of NSRFs in order to ease the burden on Member States, most of which are facing huge budgetary problems owing to the crisis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>To respond to the economic crisis, the Commission adopted in November 2008 a global strategy<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which reiterates the importance of focusing recovery actions on certain pre-defined priorities stimulating growth and job-related objectives. These objectives to invest in people, business, research and infrastructure are largely common to the priorities of cohesion policy and the resulting development programmes of individual Member States.</p>
<p>Therefore with the overriding aim to speed up implementation of these programmes, accelerate financing to beneficiaries and simplify the application of the rules, cohesion policy's response to the new needs and priorities of the crisis has been based on two pillars.</p>
<p>Firstly, changes were introduced to the legislative framework on Structural Funds to accelerate investments and simplify implementation. These changes enabled over €6 billion of additional advances to Member States in 2009 and thus significantly addressed their budgetary constraints caused by the crisis. They also largely simplified the applicable rules, facilitated access to Structural Funds and enabled newly targeted investments. Additional Commission proposals to further adapt the rules to the impact of the crisis and Member States' financial needs are currently in the legislative process with a view of adoption in early 2010.</p>
<p>Secondly, non-legislative proposals and recommendations to Member States to accelerate implementation were undertaken by the Commission. The in-built features of the legislative framework applicable to Structural Funds allow for the adaptations of the development (operational) programmes or formal modifications thereof to reflect and react to the changed circumstances.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission invited Member States to explore possible changes in priorities and objectives in order to focus spending on growth areas as indentified by the European recovery strategy. The strategic approach and broad scope of existing programmes already provide for much flexibility to adapt existing Operational Programmes (OP) to address specific needs. The Member States' Operational Programmes under Structural Funds already focus to a large extent on the priority areas of the Union’s renewed Lisbon growth and jobs strategy: people; business; research and innovation; greener economy. Far from disappearing during the financial crisis, the objectives that these priorities are designed to address have now become even more pressing. By maintaining a strategic focus on agreed priorities, Member States will be better positioned to emerge from the current crisis even stronger.</p>
<p>Cohesion policy can provide vital support and stable funding to public institutions and local and regional recovery strategies. In principle, programme managers can adjust the relative pace of spending and implementation across the different priorities and categories of beneficiaries or replace schemes with complementary measures, tailored to meet the immediate needs. Full use should be made of the scope for flexibility in the legal framework to ensure that all cohesion policy resources are fully mobilised to support Member State and regional recovery efforts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current economic context could be used as an argument to modify Operational Programmes. The Commission works with Member States to examine any early changes to the Operational Programmes needed to meet new needs, simplify delivery and speed up implementation of established priorities. In such a case, the existing legislation requires a formal programme revision under Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Therefore, in accordance with that provision, any change in the text of the Operational Programme or in the Commission decision on the OP requires a formal modifying decision which comes into force upon its adoption. However, when the modification concerns new expenditure, it applies with retroactive effect from the date of the submission to the Commission of the request for revision of the Operational Programme.</p>
<p>In addition, in line with the current Article 48 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, a modification of an OP must be preceded by an evaluation which will provide evidence on the need to revise the OP. However, this element is subject to the Commission proposal for the amendment to the Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. The proposed modification of Article 48 clarifies that instead of an evaluation other sources of information would be sufficient to justify a revision of an OP. For the revision, the Regulation establishes a three month deadline for the Commission to decide.</p>
<p>Finally, as the revision of operational programmes shall not require revision of the decision of the Commission on national strategic reference frameworks (NSRF) under provisions of Article 33 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, there is no need to modify these strategies. .</p>
<p>However any major changes in the strategy followed by Member States shall be included in their strategic reporting following provisions of Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Lisbon Treaty will radically change not only the structure of the EU and the way in which it operates, but also the lives of its citizens. It is undoubtedly a difficult matter to ensure that citizens are properly informed. It is easy to understand the value of so doing, given that concern is frequently expressed that citizens are insufficiently informed about European affairs. Thus, in the absence of adequate information, EU citizens appear to be ignorant of the provisions of the new Treaty and not to fully grasp the consequences it will have for their daily lives.</p>
<p>Will the Commission say whether, as far as communication is concerned, we have succeeded to a satisfactory extent in involving EU citizens in the change which will take place in the structure of the EU? Finally, does it believe that EU citizens are sufficiently informed about this issue and what quantitative data bear this out?

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the wide impact of the Lisbon Treaty. In order to provide factual and clear information about the new Treaty, the Commission made available on the Europa web-site<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> questions and answers as well as the consolidated text of the new Treaty. In addition, the Commission produced a Citizens' summary of the new Treaty entitled "Your Guide to the Lisbon Treaty", which sets out in simple, factual terms what changes under the new Treaty. The Guide is available in all 23 official languages of the European Union and it has been distributed in all Member States. Moreover, EUROPE DIRECT Contact Centre answers daily to citizens' questions about the implications of the Lisbon Treaty and the ways citizens can get involved in the process. For example, 2814 citizens questions related to the Lisbon Treaty were answered since its signature in December 2007.</p>
<p>With the Lisbon Treaty into force, our focus now is to make the Lisbon Treaty work for citizens. And this is exactly one of the inter-institutional communication priorities for 2010, discussed and broadly agreed by the Inter-institutional group on Information (on 24 November 2009). Apart from the above mentioned communication material, the Commission is preparing a new package of multimedia products including a modular audiovisual documentary, didactic materials for teachers and students, as well as a toolkit for communicators, and an accompanying new media campaign. The EU basic communication products on the working of the EU and its policies will also be updated to reflect the changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission continues its efforts to effectively involve citizens in the Treaty implementation. One of concrete opportunities is the public consultation on the Citizens' Initiative, which will enable one million citizens to request the Commission to bring forward a particular policy proposal. Currently, citizens have the opportunity to give their views on how the Citizens' Initiative should work in practice. The Commission will take into account these suggestions when proposing a Regulation on the Citizens' Initiative to be adopted by the European Parliament and Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The gas crisis caused by the interruption of flows from Russia via Ukraine in January 2009 showed the extent of the vulnerability of the European Union in general, and some Member States in particular, with regard to energy security and external energy dependence. Since then, progress has been made with regard to the development of energy infrastructures and interconnections as well as crisis mechanisms. The Commission has called on the actors concerned to implement the necessary next steps as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>On 16 November 2009, the European Union and Russia signed a memorandum on an early warning mechanism in the energy sector, which foresees an early evaluation of potential risks and problems related to the supply and demand of natural gas, oil and electricity, and the prevention and rapid reaction in case of an emergency situation or a threat of an emergency situation. In this respect, the early warning mechanism should seek to avoid a repetition of the gas crisis that occurred in January 2009 by working on prevention and on solving emergency situations, together with possible participation of third parties. Furthermore, the Commission considers it very important to have a transparent and predictable legal bilateral framework for EU – Russian relations in the field of energy, and therefore aims at including solid provisions in this regard in the new agreement that is under negotiation.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to monitor the development of relations between Russia and Ukraine on gas payments very closely. Concerning infrastructure, the Commission notes some progress on the implementation of the joint declaration that was adopted at the international investment conference on the modernisation of Ukraine’s gas transit system in March 2009. The Commission has had a series of meetings with the Ukrainian authorities and the international financial institutions are currently considering the details of the priority projects identified in Ukraine's gas transit system master plan. At the same time, the Commission is working closely with the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that the necessary reforms highlighted in the joint declaration from the conference are undertaken to enable the international financial institutions to provide the required financial support.</p>
<p>Regarding infrastructure, important developments in recent months include:</p>
<p>The signature of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) in June 2009 by the Commission and 8 Baltic Member States, which is a major step to improve connections between the Baltic area and the rest of the EU.</p>
<p>The signature of the Nabucco Intergovernmental Agreement in July 2009, which is an important step towards more diverse gas supplies from the Caspian region via the Southern Corridor</p>
<p>The ongoing implementation of the Regulation establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy, which allocates almost € 4 billion to specific projects in the sectors of gas and electricity interconnections, offshore wind energy and carbon capture and storage. The Commission hopes to be able to sign the first grant agreements by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>Work on the Mediterranean gas and electricity interconnections has advanced, with a view to taking concrete initiatives in 2010.</p>
<p>In July 2009, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Regulation on Security of Gas Supply, which seeks to provide an effective legislative framework for crisis situations. This proposal was discussed at the recent meeting of the energy Council and the Commission hopes to reach a political agreement on the proposal under the forthcoming Spanish EU Presidency.</p>
<p>The European Union is intensifying relations with key energy partners. For instance, an EU-US Energy Council was recently established at ministerial level. and the Commission hopes to sign the Memorandum of Understanding on energy with Iraq before the end of this year, which should include important infrastructure elements.</p>
<p>Clearly, energy security will remain high on the agenda and remain a key challenge for the next Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0428"></a>

<p>European legislation on the use of energy from renewable sources is an important measure introduced by the EU to ensure that Member States take action to provide a stable policy framework for the use of renewable energy. However, recent progress reports by the Commission indicate that some Member States are struggling to meet the target of a 5.75% share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2010. Can the Commission comment on the measures it has taken to increase the production of sustainable biofuels within the EU? In particular, what steps will the Commission take to ensure that countries like Ireland, which are currently lagging behind in meeting the target of 5.75%, introduce new incentives to encourage the production of biofuels, which would make it economically attractive for small businesses and the agricultural sector to get involved?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission can confirm that the 5.75% indicative target for the share of renewable energy in the transport sector set up by Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport is not likely to be reached at EU level. This in spite of the fact that biofuel consumption in the EU is growing rapidly and reached about 3.3% in 2008 compared to 0.5% in 2003. However the current legal framework does not give the European Commission strong tools to ensure that Member States reach their target. The Commission has launched 62 infringement procedures since 2005, against Member States for non-compliance with the Directive, but the majority of these were for failure to comply with reporting obligations or failure to set national objectives in compliance with the reference values of the Directive.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons why the Commission proposed to the Council and the Parliament to adopt a new Directive on the promotion of renewable energy sources, setting legally binding target for renewable energy and for renewable energy in the transport sector. This new Directive 2009/28/EC is thus providing a stronger legal framework for promoting the use of renewable sources in transport by changing the character of the target from an indicative to a binding target, by expanding its scope from biofuels to all renewable energy, including electricity, and by increasing the level of the target to 10% by 2020.</p>
<p>Also, the Directive establishes sustainability criteria for the biofuels. These must be fulfilled in order for biofuels to be counted towards the mandatory target and to qualify for support schemes. The sustainability criteria are referring to: a minimum mandatory level of greenhouse gas emissions savings to be attained by biofuels; protecting land with high biodiversity value; preventing deforestation, etc.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that many Member States are lagging behind in meeting the 5.75% target. However it remains the Member States' responsibility to put in place the necessary incentives to encourage the production or use of renewable energy. It is in Member States' interest to put in place the appropriate support measures at national level in order to pave the way towards reaching the 10% target for renewable energy in transport by 2020.</p>
<p>The new Directive for renewable energy will have to be transposed by Member States by December 2010. But already by 30 June next year, Member States will have to submit to the Commission their National Renewable Energy Action Plans, which will explain in detail how Member States intend to meet their target, including the 10% target for renewable energy in transport. The Commission will evaluate these plans and take appropriate action, including the launching of infringement procedures against Member States which fail to submit plans in accordance with the requirements of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0441"></a>

<p>The Renewable Energy Directive<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that is part of the energy-climate package has to be transposed by 5 December 2010. Article 4 requires each Member State to adopt a national renewable energy action plan and to notify it to the Commission by 30 June 2010. These National Renewable Energy Action Plans must be prepared using the template adopted by the Commission on 30 June 2009 as foreseen by Article 4(1) and Annex VI of the Directive. In order to help Member States to prepare their National Renewable Energy Action Plans, the Directive also requires each Member State to publish and notify to the Commission a document on the intended use of the Directive's cooperation mechanisms by 31 December 2009. No deviation from this calendar is foreseen by the Commission. In addition, a number of implementing measures on the biofuels sustainability scheme are under preparation.</p>
<p>The revised Emissions Trading Directive<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> foresees the adoption of a large number of implementing measures, many of which are subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The Commission started working on the implementation immediately after the adoption of the climate and energy package in December 2008. The first measure, namely the decision on the list of sectors and sub-sectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage will be adopted on schedule by the end of December 2009. The preparatory work for other Commission delegated decisions is on track.</p>
<p>The Effort Sharing Decision<a href="#defann_7_3" name="refann_7_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> foresees the adoption of four implementing measures, all of which are subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The Commission started working on the implementation immediately after the adoption of the climate and energy package in December 2008 and the preparatory work is on track.</p>
<p>The CCS Directive<a href="#defann_7_4" name="refann_7_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> does not contain any implementing measures, but invites the Commission to produce guidance on three issues. Work on the guidance is on track.</p>

One of the main accomplishments of this action has been the preparation together with industry and Member states of European Industrial Initiatives for low-carbon technologies (including wind, solar, bio-energy and smart grid) with identified objectives, actions, necessary resources, precise time frame, until the year 2020 in the form of technology roadmaps. During 2010 this initiatives will be launched and start its practical implementation. In its proposal on "Investing in the development of low-carbon energy technologies"<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission estimates that an additional investment of €50 billion in energy technology research will be needed over the next ten years. This means almost tripling the annual investment in the European Union, from €3 to €8 billion.</p>
<p>The priorities of the Research Theme funded under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Program (2007-2013), with a total budget of €2.350 million, are being aligned to the objectives and roadmaps of the SET Plan Industrial Initiatives.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Energy Europe programme<a href="#defann_8_5" name="refann_8_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> supports deployment of sustainable energy and focuses on the removal of market barriers and creating a more favourable business environment for renewable energy markets.

Such so called locational charges are specifically allowed in the Electricity Regulation. The United Kingdom (UK) applies such a scheme. The Commission does not have reason to believe that the resulting charges are not cost-reflective.</p>
<p>Regulation 1228/2003 (and 714/2009) also provide for the establishment of an inter TSO compensation (ITC) mechanism for costs incurred as a result of hosting cross border flows of electricity. All ITC payments are to and from TSOs, and are then included in transmission tariffs for system users in Member States.</p>
<p>Until now, the ITC mechanism has been operated on a voluntary basis. The Commission intends to make proposals for binding guidelines on ITC to be adopted under the Comitology procedure. The proposals will also include guidelines to harmonise transmission charges for producers of electricity. This will be based on the draft guidelines developed by the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The complaint concerned the basic plan for a system to supply the Canales del Taibilla water management body with water from the Cenajo reservoir and was supported by the town councils of Cieza, Blanca and Abarán, as well as by the irrigation cooperatives and a petition signed by 11 000 citizens.</p>

<p>The objective of this project is to ensure water supply to a population of over 700 000 inhabitants (that can increase to over one million in the summer season) in the Murcia region of Spain. Current supply does not meet some of the requirements in the Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> due to high levels of sulphates and magnesium. The project, co-financed by the EU via the Cohesion Funds, replaces a previous one ("Conexión Embalse de la Fuensanta-río Taibilla") that was discarded due to its high environmental impact.</p>
<p>The Commission received in 2005 a complaint on this project, raising several issues concerning likely breaches of EC environmental Law, in particular of Directives on environmental impact assessment<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and nature protection<a href="#defann_10_3" name="refann_10_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><a href="#defann_10_4" name="refann_10_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This complaint was closed in October 2005 since a thorough examination of the case did not reveal any infringement of EU environmental Law.</p>
<p>On 8 January 2008, a new complaint – from a different complainant - was submitted to the Commission and registered in EU PILOT .The case was subject to a full assessment and an exchange of information on the project between the Spanish authorities and the services of the Commission took place.</p>
<p>The Commission services informed the complainant of their conclusions, excluding an infringement, by letter of 29 June 2009 (and a further confirmatory letter of 13 October 2009).</p>
<p>In summary, the closure of the file was based on the following reasons:</p>
<p>Many of the issues raised concerned potential breaches of national procedures where the Commission has no powers to intervene.</p>
<p>The project was at the time undergoing an environmental impact assessment, conducted by the competent Environmental authority. Reference inter alia to alternatives considered and nature and water protection issues is made in the body of the assessment.</p>
<p>Since the above procedure is the most appropriate instrument to identify likely effects on the environment, and the project had not been approved, no infringement of EU environmental Law could be identified.</p>
<p>While launching the tendering procedure before the environmental impact assessment procedure was completed is not an example of best practice, the EIA directive does not include specific requirements on this issue. The only obligation imposed by the Directive is that the authorisation of the project cannot be granted before the assessment procedure is finished.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not have information which would confirm or refute the views expressed by top managers of Austrian companies in the survey mentioned by the Honourable Member. The Commission is also not aware of the methodology used to measure perception in this survey.</p>
<p>Europol's Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA) Report and other law enforcement sources highlight the increasing activities of organised criminal groups in Eastern Europe, including on economic crime. However, the little statistical data available are insufficient to establish any link between the enlargement of the Union and the increase of economic crime activities. The very same survey quoted by the Honourable Member indicates that the Austrian managers' perception has remained stable since 2003 (i.e. before countries from Eastern Europe joined the Union).</p>
<p>The Commission is already very active in preventing and fighting economic and financial crimes in the Union and proposed to further strengthen the existing actions in the Stockholm Programme, which will set the Union's priorities for the next five years. The most relevant actions envisaged aim at proposing criminal measures on counterfeiting on intellectual property rights, expanding the possibilities to confiscate the proceeds of organised crime by amending the existing legal framework and enhancing the tools to trace criminal assets, better preventing and fighting corruption and strengthening the Member States' capacity to conduct financial investigations.</p>
<p>With respect to non-EU countries, strengthening the capacities of law enforcement authorities is an important part of the pre-accession preparations of the enlargement countries. Organised crime groups have taken advantage of insufficient capacities of the state institutions in these countries to counter criminal activities, to control their borders and to cooperate with their counterparts in other countries in the region and in the EU. An Organised Crime Threat Assessment has been carried out for the Southeast European region by the South-East European Cooperative Initiative (S.E.C.I.) Regional Centre for Combating Trans-border Crime in collaboration with Europol. Some of the countries have concluded cooperation agreements with Europol and such agreements are under preparation for other countries. The Commission supports with its financial assistance both at regional and national levels the improvement of the capacities of the law enforcement authorities in the enlargement countries to fight organised crime more efficiently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0442"></a>

<p>The Commission has been actively engaged in Nicaragua for many years. There are no strings attached to the EC’s development cooperation. However, respect for democracy, the rule of law and good governance are basic conditions, which are included in all financing conventions signed with the authorities of this country.</p>
<p>Following the fraudulent municipal elections of November 2008, the Commission decided, having consulted the Council, that budgetary support was not an appropriate modality for development cooperation with Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Since then, the Commission has been engaged in a dialogue with Nicaragua on electoral and governance issues, which has lead to a partial resumption of budget support in favour of education.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue this critical dialogue and hopes to be able to make further disbursements once the necessary conditions are met.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely coordinating its engagement with the EU Member States as well as other donors and has taken due note of the resolutions passed by the European Parliament on 18 December 2008 and most recently on 26 November 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to maintaining in overall terms the level of aid to Nicaragua, if need be through the reorientation of cooperation programmes.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that all other aid delivery modalities, except for budget support, have been maintained, and cooperation, including the approval of new projects and the mid term review of assistance to the country, has progressed normally in the course of 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0443"></a>

<p>Last spring, a report was presented by the Science Group at the request of the Alcohol and Health Forum entitled 'The impact of marketing communication on the volume and patterns of consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially by young people'.</p>
<p>The report reveals that twelve of thirteen studies examined show that alcohol advertising affects the point at which young people start drinking alcohol and persuades those who already drink to increase their consumption. The studies also show that there is a direct link between how much advertising young people are exposed to and how much they increase their consumption. Moreover, a report produced by the Commission shows that self-regulation on alcohol advertising, as advocated by the alcohol industry, does not produce particularly good results. Strict regulations are more effective.</p>
<p>The rules already in existence stipulating that alcohol advertising must not be aimed directly at young people are, in practice, ineffective. A total ban on alcohol advertising is the best way of reducing drinking among young people, as also shown by a study published in the scientific journal 'The Lancet'.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, would the Commission consider banning alcohol advertising, in the same way as tobacco advertising, on health grounds?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member raises an important and relevant issue.</p>
<p>The current Swedish Presidency has done a great deal to keep alcohol related issues high on the European agenda. The Council Conclusions, adopted earlier this month, called on both the Member States and the Commission to do more to protect children against advertising and marketing influences.</p>
<p>As the first EU Alcohol Strategy sets out, the Commission supports the better regulation of alcoholic beverages in two key ways. Firstly, through the Audiovisual Media Services Directive<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provides a framework for minimum standards for audiovisual commercial communications for alcoholic beverages present in television broadcasts and on-demand audiovisual media services. It states that audiovisual commercial communications for alcoholic beverages shall not be aimed specifically at minors and television advertising shall not depict minors consuming these beverages.</p>
<p>Secondly through two new structures set up to support the implementation of the EU Alcohol Strategy. The first of these is the Committee for National Alcohol Policy and Action, where Member States can share and compare approaches at national level.</p>
<p>The second is the European Alcohol and Health Forum which brings together diverse stakeholders from across society who commit to developing voluntary approaches to reduce alcohol related harm. All parts of the alcohol value chain are represented in this Forum (from the producers, but also to the retailers and the hospitality sector.)</p>
<p>The topic of alcohol advertising is an important one for the Forum, and a specific Taskforce on Marketing Communication was set up to explore the various issues and to support the development of a common understanding.</p>
<p>It will be important, in the coming years, to take stock of these actions and assess whether, taken together, they are enough to protect children and young people. In particular whether the existing statutory frameworks at EU and national level, combined with the voluntary actions of stakeholders, are working or whether this "mix" needs to be rebalanced. Only at that point will it be possible to consider whether stronger action at EU level on alcohol advertising is necessary.</p>
<p>However, the Commission's view is that for now, it is important to continue with the course that was set with the adoption of the EU Alcohol Strategy, and for which a wide consensus exists.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>By way of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Member States are legally committed to protecting habitat types of Community interest, including raised and blanket bogs for which the active forms are of priority interest under the Directive. This is principally to be achieved by the establishment, protection and management of Special Areas of Conservation. Ireland has particular responsibility within the EU for the protection of these habitat types.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the relevant authorities in Ireland to put in place the necessary protection measures. Any plan or project that may negatively affect a Natura 2000 site may only proceed if it is fully in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 6(3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive. This requires an appropriate assessment of the activity to be authorized in light of the site's conservation objectives. If it is concluded that this will adversely affect the integrity of the site, then the plan or project may only proceed in the absence of alternative solutions if it is of overriding public interest and where the damage to the site is fully offset by compensatory measures. As active raised and blanket bogs are priority habitats types, this would also require a formal opinion of the Commission in relation to the imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</p>
<p>Natura 2000 covers only a proportion of Ireland's peatlands. Ireland also protects some peatlands as Natural Heritage Areas under national legislation. There are still large areas of peatland outside of these areas where peat extraction is unaffected by the protection safeguards applying to these sites. As far as the Commission is aware, Bord na Mona does not extract or source peat from Natura 2000 or other protected sites and, therefore, their continued operation of peat powered stations cannot be a pretext for the failure to take action to protect the designated peatlands.</p>
<p>The latest conservation status assessment published by the Irish authorities is particularly alarming, especially for active raised bogs. Intact raised bog in Ireland is now extremely rare and has decreased in area by over 35% in the last ten years<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Ongoing deterioration of the hydrological conditions of the habitat at current rates caused by peat cutting, forestry and burning are deemed to severely threaten the viability of the habitat at most locations.</p>
<p>The Commission has already made clear its view to the Honourable Member in its response to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-3449_EN.html">E-3449/08</a><a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> that there is an urgent need to put in place effective management and protection measures for Ireland's Natura 2000 peatlands, including the prohibition of turf cutting where this is not compatible with the conservation of the sites.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to clarify to the Honourable Member that no "permission" for continued damaging peat extraction within Natura 2000 sites was approved by the Commission for the period mentioned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Bonifacio Strait which separates Corsica from Sardinia is hazardous to shipping.</p>
<p>France and Italy have prohibited vessels sailing under their flag and transporting hazardous or noxious products from passing through these straits since 1993. Nowadays, therefore, there is very little traffic in the Strait, and its economic importance is negligible. But an accident involving a vessel which was neither French nor Italian, but was sailing under another country's flag and transporting hazardous goods, could cause a disaster on the scale of the sinking of the Erika (flying the Maltese flag) or the Prestige (sailing under the flag of the Bahamas).</p>
<p>The Bonifacio Strait is classified as a strait 'used for international shipping' and, as such, is subject to the right of free 'transit passage' by merchant vessels. This means that a potentially dangerous situation continues to exist, despite the absence of any compelling economic arguments for maintaining it. The inappropriate classification of the Strait undermines the objectives of the International Corsican and Sardinian Marine Reserve, a major marine conservation project.</p>

<p>However, the Commission wishes to underline that the characterisation of straits used for international navigation and the regime applicable in these areas derives from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>
<p>Given the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member regarding the prevention of maritime accidents and of pollution caused by ships, the Commission wishes to stress the important effort undertaken by the European Union in matters of maritime safety in the last ten years, including the adoption of three maritime packages the latest of which, agreed by the Parliament and the Council in April 2009, contained eight legislative measures.

<p>I would like the Commission to look into the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report. The IMF diplomatically points out, without naming names, that some Italian banks fail to consolidate completely the losses incurred in their foreign branches and subsidiaries. The IMF bases its reservations on the fact that the losses incurred by financial institutions outside the EU are higher than the financial losses of banks operating in the eurozone. The IMF points out that the lower the level of consolidation of accounts, the lower will be the loss rates reported.</p>
<p>Only one Italian bank has expanded abroad, and the IMF’s reservations can apply only to this bank. Does this reporting method not pose a threat to the stability of the financial system, given that it makes the President of the IMF uneasy? Unicredit’s subsidiaries in Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and former Soviet countries need support to maintain liquidity. For example, the Polish bank Pekao S.A. is supporting Unicredit Ukraine by providing cash injections amounting to tens of millions of euros in successive accounting quarters; however, unlike other banks in the region, Pekao is not drawing on any reserves for its Ukrainian investment. Would the Commission state if these kinds of accounting procedures and ‘creative accounting’ are admissible? Do they ensure the liquidity of the banking system in the medium and long term? What financial consequences might they have for the financial systems of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the countries of the former USSR?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the concerns related to the application of inappropriate accounting procedure by some Italian Banks, it has to be pointed out that Italian banks, like all the other European listed banks, prepare since 2005 their consolidated financial reports according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union, under Regulation No. 1606/2002.</p>
<p>Under IFRS, banks are required to consolidate all their subsidiaries, independently of where they are located and the intra-group transactions have to be eliminated. Furthermore, according to Directive n. 2006/43/EC financial reports have to be audited by an authorised external auditor.</p>
<p>According to its 2008 Audited Consolidated Financial Statement, Unicredit has applied IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and therefore it has consolidated all its subsidiaries, including those in Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria. This means that credit losses reported in the financial statements of the Ukrainian, Romanian and Bulgarian subsidiaries of Unicredit are also reported in the consolidated financial statements of Unicredit Group.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission has no particular remarks on the accounting rules/procedures applied by Uncredit Group.</p>
<p>With specific regards to the concerns raised, it is worth noting that IMF Report when it states that "Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain do not report losses on either foreign branches or foreign subsidiaries" seems to describe the data coverage of statistics used by the IMF for the purposes of its report.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0457"></a>

<p>Recent research by the product quality certification body TÜV indicates that two thirds of all cheap toys which it has examined do not comply with current quality requirements. One third even contain prohibited softeners (phthalates). As the test was specifically concerned with cheap toys, there is also an important social dimension to this problem.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of these problems? How will the Commission enforce the stricter requirements in the new Toys Directive, bearing in mind that even efforts to enforce the previous Directive are evidently not succeeding? And what action will the Commission take to ensure that all children can grow up with safe toys?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has knowledge of the press release mentioned by the Honourable Member and is aware of the non compliant toys referred to, in particular non compliances caused by excessive amounts of phthalates, presence of chemical substances or small parts, however has not yet been officially informed by the German Government.</p>
<p>When toys placed on the market can jeopardize the safety of children under the current or new Toy Safety Directive, Member States are obliged to take all appropriate measures to withdraw, prohibit or restrict the placing on the market. The Member States shall inform the Commission immediately of this measure, first of all under the rapid alert system RAPEX and in some instances also in conformity with the so-called safeguard clause procedures. All the Member States are informed and have the obligation to adopt appropriate follow-up measures against the same toy.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that the safety of children is already at the heart of the current Toy Safety Directive 88/378/EEC which contains mandatory safety requirements for toys to be placed on the market. These requirements have been enhanced by the new Toys Safety Directive (TSD) which will enter into force from January 2011 on. These new rules are among the most stringent in the world. They are the result of several studies, an extensive impact assessment and a widespread public consultation as well as an intensive discussion during the legislative process in the European Parliament and in the Council. The new Toy Safety Directive also states that other acts of Community legislation such as, for example, the rules on general product safety and on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations, substances and mixtures, have to be respected. Therefore toys have to comply also with REACH regulation 1907/2006 and, in particular, with its Annex XVII restricting the use of phthalates in toys and childcare articles. By mid January 2010 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) will deliver a report on the review of the existing restrictions of phthalates.</p>
<p>Toys are already in the focus of market surveillance by the Member States and the Commission co-finances such activities when they are coordinated among several countries. The Commission is pleased to inform the Honourable Member that for example in 2009, market surveillance authorities have performed a joint action aimed at testing toys placed on the EU market with a focus on small parts, magnets and heavy metals. This joint action, co-financed through the Commission's consumer policy actions, is foreseen to end in mid 2010.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new Directive will also enhance market surveillance. It is the first sectoral Directive to incorporate and be aligned to the general framework for the marketing of products in the EU, the so called "goods package" (Regulation No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products, and repealing Regulation (EEC) no 339/93 and Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products and repealing decision 93/465/EEC). The strengthened rules on the market surveillance and control at external borders contained in the new horizontal Regulation No 765/2008 shall be applicable to the market surveillance of toys.</p>
<p>The Commission also encourages improved checks at the production line, and work is also underway with the toy sector to develop guidance to parents and others buying toys for children.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0459"></a>

<p>So far, 9 EU Member States have recognised sign language by law or in their constitutions, including very recently - on 9 November 2009 - Hungary. The European Parliament has twice considered the subject of sign language in its resolutions, which it did in 1988 and 1998, but so far to little practical effect.</p>
<p>In 2007 the High Level Group on Multilingualism made numerous recommendations on multilingualism. It stressed that multilingualism also extended to sign languages.</p>
<p>On 26 November 2009, the General (Foreign) Affairs Council reached agreement on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 30 of which includes the following provision: 'Persons with disabilities shall be entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including sign languages and deaf culture.'</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the Flensburg Recommendations on the Implementation of Policy Measures for Regional or Minority Languages adopted on 22-25 June 2000 at the International Conference organised by the European Center for Minority Issues (ECMI) requesting due recognition to sign languages. According to Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union it is the responsibility of the Member States to put into practice at national and regional level concrete measures to promote language policy, and this applies likewise to the recognition of sign languages.</p>
<p>However, if the use of sign language becomes necessary to enable deaf people to access employment, career advancement or training, the issue could possibly fall under the scope of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission had presented on 2 July 2008 a proposal for a Directive (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2008&amp;nu_doc=0426">COM(2008) 426</a> final) which, in a broad perspective, aims at implementing the principle of equal treatment beyond the confines of employment. The discrimination grounds envisaged are religion and belief, disability, age and sexual orientation, i.e. those (together with gender and race, already addressed in previous EU Directives) which Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enumerates.</p>
<p>The Commission also develops a policy to promote language learning and linguistic diversity fully inclusive of all languages present in the EU, thus including sign languages. Through its funding programmes the Commission co-funds projects and networks to promote language learning and linguistic diversity. In 2008, the call for proposals under the Lifelong Programme 2007- 2013 gave priority to projects and networks aiming to promote languages of people with special needs. Under the call for proposals 2009, one of the priorities was again "identifying, exchanging and building on good practices in teaching languages to people with special needs"<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In 2008 three projects addressing sign languages were selected and are ongoing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission draws attention to the fact that all Member States and the European Community signed the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 30 March 2007 to the extent of their competences. Various Articles (9, 21, 24 and 30) state obligations for the State Parties to take appropriate measures in relation to sign languages, to provide assistance, to accept and facilitate its use and its learning. In particular Article 21 refers to the recognition and promotion of the use of sign languages as one of such measures.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission recalls that the linguistic regime of the European institutions is governed by Council Regulation n° 1/1958<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This Regulation lists in its first Article the languages that are the official and working languages of the institutions. It needs unanimity for adoption or modification by the Council and it requires no proposal from the Commission for its amendment. Any inclusion of specific provisions regarding sign languages would be subject of the forgoing procedure. As regards its own practice, the Commission provides interpretation in several sign languages and also funded a project training interpreters in sign languages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

A characteristic example is Greece where, with the collusion of the Commission and PASOK and ND governments and the Court of Justice of the European Communities (ECJ), the retirement age for women working in the public sector is being postponed by between 5 and 17 years, and the public and social character of the social security system is being called into question.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the need to ensure adequate social protection. It points out that, under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, social protection falls within the competence of the Member States. This being so, the Commission works with the Member States within the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion. The common OMC objectives agreed by the Member States in the pension area focus on three main points: first, retirement pensions should be adequate. Second, retirement schemes should be financially sustainable. Third, pension systems should be adapted to the requirements of modern society. A key feature of the work within the Social OMC is a joint Commission and Council analysis and assessment of national strategies for social protection and social inclusion in the form of joint reports.</p>
<p>The 2009 Joint Report focused on promoting working life as an important factor in ensuring that retirement systems remain sustainable and that the financial challenge does not turn into a social challenge, given the ageing of our societies. It underlined the fact that long-term adequacy of pensions depends on continuing efforts to meet the Lisbon target of a 50% employment rate for older workers, notwithstanding the downturn. It also emphasised the importance of monitoring the coverage of vulnerable workers by pension systems<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission and the Member States jointly assess the long-term economic and budgetary challenge posed by pension systems, given the ageing of the population. Updates of that assessment under the Ageing Report and the Sustainability Report were released in 2009<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The Ageing Report found that, as a result of demographic change, public pension expenditure in the Member States would increase from 10.1% of GDP in 2007 to 18.8% in 2060. However, the Report found that public expenditure would amount to only 12.5% of GDP in 2060 thanks to reforms implemented in the Member States and a projected increase in employment rates. Increasing the length of working life can thus ensure that pension systems are adequate and sustainable.</p>
<p>As regards the situation referred to by the Honourable Member in the Court’s judgment of 26 March 2009 in the Commission versus Greece case, the Commission points out that the Court ruled against Greece for failing to fulfil its obligations under Article 141 TEC (Article 157 TFEU), which lays down the principle of equal pay for male and female workers. In the case in question, the Court noted that the pension, paid in accordance with the Greek Code, met the criteria laid down in the case-law of the Court and thus enabled it to be regarded as pay within the meaning of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Court’s judgment relates only to the issue of differences in retirement age for men and women.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The digitisation of agricultural plot limits in Greece, which was scheduled for completion in 2008, is still under way and is, for technical reasons, unlikely to be achieved by the end of the year, with the result that farmers are in danger of not receiving the subsidies to which they are entitled. Given the continued slump in prices for almost all crops and livestock products, now in its second consecutive year, a portion of the produce to which time, work and money have already been devoted remains unsold and is being left to rot in the fields, while many farmers have not received the market value of the produce (peaches, wine, cereals etc) sold to traders and cooperatives, with the result that subsidies now make up almost half of farmers’ earnings. Now that there is a danger of subsidies not being paid, the survival of farmers, in particular small and struggling medium-scale farmers, who have accumulated heavy debts and are in desperate financial straits, is now in the balance. </p>
<p>Will the Commission immediately pay all subsidies to which the farmers are entitled, irrespective of whether or not digitisation is completed, so as save them from ruin and enable them to continue farming?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Firstly, the Commission would like to point out to the Honourable Member that the financial management of the Common Agricultural Policy is shared between the Member States and the Commission in accordance with Regulation 1290/2005<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The payments to the farmers are made by the Paying Agencies accredited by the individual Member States. Member States are subsequently reimbursed by the Commission.</p>
<p>In Greece, the final deadline to lodge the 2009 claims for subsidies was 15 May 2009 (extendible to 9 June 2009, although with penalties). As in the Greek set-up, the digitalised agricultural plots are part of the farmers' claim (beside the alpha-numerical information) this date is also the deadline to finalize digitalisation.</p>
<p>Farmers together with the Farmer Unions were given the responsibility for the digitalisation. However, due to problems in the Farmer Unions, serious delays occurred in the digitalisation process. It should be noted that the presence of the farmers is necessary to do this work.</p>
<p>According to the legislation on direct payments and for evident sound management reasons, the controls must be carried out before the payments are effected by the Paying Agencies. This requires all agricultural plots to be digitalised.</p>
<p>It is up to the Greek authorities to accelerate the digitalisation process and to finalize it to be able to pay farmers as quickly as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has decided to refer Bulgaria to the Court for its failure to comply with Article 5 of the Directive on waste<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Waste Framework Directive) obliging the Member States to establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations.</p>
<p>At the time of the expiry of the two months deadline to reply to the Reasoned Opinion sent on 1 December 2008, the infringement persisted, illustrated among other by several hundred thousand tonnes of household waste from Sofia stored in baled form under conditions contrary to Community legislation, as the capacity of the Suhodol landfill was about to be exhausted, without other existing facilities being capable of absorbing the production of waste.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken into account all information provided by Bulgaria referring to the waste situation around Sofia and concluded on the basis of that information that while progress has been made in the disposal of baled waste as well as initiating the necessary steps for the creation of an integrated system of waste management for Sofia, the so-called "Sofia Waste Project", the problem of a lack of adequate and sustainable waste disposal infrastructure has still not been solved.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the steps taken by Bulgaria to create waste disposal infrastructure which it is hoped and expected will provide a long term sustainable solution for the Bulgarian capital Sofia. As the deadline for establishing the necessary infrastructure has already expired, the Commission expects Bulgaria to provide it within the shortest possible time and to ensure that the new facilities are fully in line with all relevant Community legislation, notably with the requirement of using best available technology as stipulated in Article 5 of the Directive on Waste.

<p>The EU need to develop a vision for a near-zero carbon energy system for the EU by 2050.</p>
<p>Low or no carbon technologies for electricity generation, clean vehicle technologies and eco-efficient heating and cooling of buildings must be at the centre of any decarbonisation agenda. This is why the Commission has been in the past few years coming up with a full range of initiatives aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy sources, setting standards for energy efficiency, and promoting technologies for sustainable use of fossil fuels as well as new technologies in renewables and energy efficiency. The full set of measures under adoption and to be adopted in the near future were outlined in full details namely in the Strategic Energy Reviews adopted by the Commission in December 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>In the Communication "A sustainable future of transport" published in June 2009, the Commission identifies challenges, instruments and priorities for transport with a time horizon of 2050. Next year the Commission will publish a White Paper on Transport Policy which will present policy measures to be adopted in the area transport for the next decade. The new White Paper will focus on combining mobility and decarbonisation to promote economic growth and social progress as well as progress towards a sustainable transport system. In this context, electromobility will no doubt have a major role to play although this should not exclude alternative solutions.</p>
<p>The Commission has supported the development of alternative vehicle and fuel technologies over many years. Biofuel, natural gas, hydrogen, and electrical vehicle projects have received major funding from the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. A Joint Technology Initiative for Fuel Cells and Hydrogen, with a Community funding of €470 million has been created in 2008. Targets for biofuels and renewable energies in the motor fuel market have been set, sustainability criteria for biofuels are being developed, and favourable tax treatment for alternative fuels has been enabled. The Clean Vehicle Directive, which has been adopted in March 2009, will require that energy consumption, CO2 emission and pollutant emissions are taken into account in purchase decisions on vehicles for public transport services. This will promote the market introduction of clean and energy efficient vehicles. Legislation has been introduced to reduce the CO2 emissions of new passenger cars to 130 grams per kilometre on average (phased in from 2012 to 2015) and further to 95 g/km in 2020 (Regulation (EC) No 443/2009), and similar legislation has been proposed for light commercial vehicles (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2009&amp;nu_doc=0593">COM(2009)593</a>).</p>
<p>2. The Recovery Plan, adopted in November 2008, foresees three Public Private Partnerships (PPP). One of them is the Green Car Initiative. The Green Car Initiative (total 5b€, with 1b€ for R&amp;D in FP-7, and 4b€ EIB loans) will support the development of new and sustainable forms of road transport. A priority will be the electrification of road vehicles (electromobility). The European Commission will provide funding for research &amp; development, standardisation and facilitation of market introduction, and in 2010 €108 million will be provided.</p>
<p>In addition to these industry support actions, the Commission is launching a study in order to investigate the environmental and other impacts of a potential widespread market introduction of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p>The Commission will also propose harmonised requirements for the approval of electric vehicles, including pure electric and hybrid vehicles, in 2010. The proposal will introduce specific requirements with regard to electric safety in the European Community vehicle type-approval framework by mandating UNECE Regulation 100.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Commission is intending to mandate the European Standardisation bodies to develop or review existing standards so that interoperability between the charging system for batteries used in electric vehicles will be ensured. Thus users will be able to use the same chargers for a range of cars, without having to buy a new charger every time they buy a new car or a new battery. It would also allow consumers to charge their cars easily if they are driving across borders or when travelling within their own Member State. It would also facilitate charging at public access points and would facilitate the roll-out of charging infrastructures. Finally it would dissuade member states from taking action individually because this might lead to overlapping solutions</p>
<p>The adoption of harmonised rules will enable a simple, straightforward and cheap approval process and thus will encourage the quick market introduction of low-carbon vehicles in the European Union. Such a simplified new framework for electric vehicles will in turn enhance the competitiveness of the European industry and will speed up the decarbonisation of road transport.</p>
<p>3. Build up of charging infrastructure networks is a matter under consideration within the Green Car Initiative. A large European electromobility project, for which a call for proposals is open until 14 January 2010, will include vehicles, infrastructure and the development of common codes, standards and regulations. Further R&amp;D work is foreseen in future calls of the Green Car Initiative to optimize the performance and reduce costs, as well as developing smart grid applications for this purpose (to optimize grid load, to support different business models and payment schemes etc…)</p>
<p>4. The potential of batteries on board of electric vehicles to serve as energy storage for the electricity grid is being investigated in recently selected projects the Commission is already funding through the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. Further research and demonstration on the role of the electric car batteries in relation to balancing electricity supply and demand is a matter under consideration within the Green Car Initiative and will benefit from the results of the current projects.</p>
<p>5. The European Investment Bank (EIB) loan mechanisms will provide an important part of financing under the Green Car Initiative. There are two instruments available:</p>
<p>the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF); and</p>
<p>the European Clean Transport Facility (ECTF); a facility which has been specifically designed for supporting eco-friendly research, development and innovation in the transport industry.</p>
<p>The RSFF is an innovative scheme to improve access to debt finance for higher risk investments in the field of research, development and innovation while the ECTF has been part of the anti-crisis package that the EIB has set up in autumn of 2008, aimed specifically at research to lower emissions from transport. 4 billion € have been made available within the ECTF for the Green Car Initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0471"></a>

<p>The British authorities are conducting entry checks on French territory on the basis of a bilateral agreement between France and the United Kingdom.

<p>Different levels of detection are not necessarily due to different procedures or equipment but to other reasons for example the technical limitations of such equipment or its use: random, based on intelligence or risk analyses.
