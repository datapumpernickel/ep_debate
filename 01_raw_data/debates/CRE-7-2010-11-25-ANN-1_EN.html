<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council has not discussed the situation in the Serbian region Sandžak and cannot comment on the issue.</p>
<p>However, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), which is currently being ratified, states that Serbia and the EU shall seek to strengthen regional and local development cooperation, with the objective of contributing to economic development and reducing regional imbalances. Specific attention shall be given to cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.</p>
<p>Allow me to add that the SAA also establishes close economic cooperation, including the development of a free trade area and financial cooperation that shall take due account of the priority areas related to the Community acquis in the field of regional development.</p>
<p>The Council has reaffirmed on many occasions its full support for the European perspective of the region, including Serbia, which remains essential for its stability, reconciliation and future. In accordance with the Stabilisation and Association process and particularly with the SAA, which is currently being ratified, the Council supports Serbia’s efforts to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and to contribute to political, economic and institutional stability in Serbia, as well as to the stabilisation of the region.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes Serbia’s commitment to EU integration by undertaking key reforms in line with European standards. In recognition of these efforts, the Council has recently taken some important decisions with regard to Serbia: on 30 November 2009, the Council lifted visa restrictions; on 14 June 2010, it decided to begin ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and, on 25 October 2010, to begin the procedure laid down in Article 49 TEU.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of persons belonging to minorities, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, in December 2009, the Council stressed the importance of protection of all minorities and encouraged the governments of the Western Balkan countries, including the Serbian Government, to take the necessary action to address these issues. It added that the Roma minority continues to face very difficult living conditions and discrimination.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 7 and 8 December 2009, the Council recalled that strengthening the rule of law, fight against corruption and accelerating economic reforms remain important, and that a constructive approach towards regional cooperation, including trade, remains essential. The reform agenda must be continued.</p>
<p>The specific priorities of the European Partnership with Serbia, adopted on 18 February 2008, also include human rights and protection of minorities. Serbia must therefore fulfil all obligations arising out of membership of the Council of Europe and must ensure compliance with the human rights provisions of the new constitution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0516"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The economic and financial crisis, which began in 2008, has caused a sharp decline in the number of jobs and in potential output, and has led to a serious deterioration in public finances.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of crisis, the June 2010 European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, which is designed to guarantee smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as evidenced by its objectives, relating in particular to employment, research and development, renewable energy and energy efficiency, early school leaving and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>In July, the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, adopted the broad economic policy guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy aimed at improving competitiveness via structural reforms.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council began examining certain structural elements such as fiscal frameworks, the effectiveness of education as a vehicle for growth, and the sustainability of pensions.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010, the Council also adopted the employment policy guidelines, in order to give precise guidance to the Member States on defining their National Reform Programmes and implementing reforms, reflecting interdependence and in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>As regards economic governance, the European Council of 28 and 29 October 2010 endorsed the report of the Task Force on economic governance and called for a fast track approach to be followed on the adoption of secondary legislation needed for the implementation of many of the recommendations. This will enhance confidence and thus contribute to sustainable growth, employment and competitiveness. Therefore, in order to ensure balanced and sustainable growth, Heads of State or Government agree on the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.</p>
<p>As regards growth rates, the Council has made no estimates. The latest interim report by the Commission estimates growth of 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0523"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) In the Communication ‘The CAP towards 2020<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>’, which it recently adopted, the Commission refers to the option of reviewing the direct payment system within the framework of the future post-2013 CAP.</p>
<p>In June 2009, the Council took note of Presidency conclusions, supported by a number of delegations, which stated that, in order to meet the challenges for agriculture after 2013, any future direct payments scheme will need to be fair and legitimate, effective, simple to implement, sufficiently flexible, and easy to justify and explain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has taken due note of the position expressed by the European Parliament in its Resolution on the future of the CAP, adopted on 8 July, and in particular of its recommendation that, in order to ensure a fair distribution of CAP funds to farmers across the EU, fair and objective criteria should be clearly defined for the implementation of a fair system of distribution that respects the diversity of farming in the EU.</p>
<p>I would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that Commissioner Cioloş will present his Communication to the Council as early as Monday 29 November.</p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency attaches great importance to this issue, which is why it has scheduled a political debate for the Council meeting of 13-14 December 2010.</p>
<p>However, the Council will be able to express an opinion on the details of the issue of the fair distribution of direct payments only after it has received the legislative proposals that the Commission is due to submit to it and to the European Parliament in July 2011.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and the Council will then be required to make a decision, under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the objectives set out in the Belgian Presidency’s work programme and in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, the Member States are to undertake reforms in order to make progress towards achieving sustainable and transparent economic growth.</p>
<p>All Member States face the problems of illegal employment and unfair competition on the market. Workers on the labour market are exploited, often have no social protection and are also sometimes obliged to accept undeclared work.</p>
<p>High unemployment means that employers cannot find the workers they need because unemployment benefits are similar to the wages on offer. There are even situations where people prefer to work on the black, because that lets them continue to benefit from employment exchange services and not lose out on allowances. As a result, people generally choose the option that suits them best. The objectives set in Member States’ annual budgets are not achieved because the revenue forecast in these budgets is not collected.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Whereas Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Union shall aim at full employment, Article 147 TFEU stipulates that the Union shall contribute to a high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States and by supporting and, if necessary, complementing their action. In doing so, the competences of the Member States shall be respected.</p>
<p>To date, the Commission has submitted no legislative proposals to support or complement Member States’ actions aimed at combating the undeclared work of EU citizens.</p>
<p>However, on 21 October 2010, the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, adopted guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States; the latter will have to transpose them into their national policies via national reform programmes. Since those guidelines are aimed, in particular, at reducing structural unemployment and promoting job quality, it may be argued that they are designed to boost declared and legal work.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of illegally staying third-country nationals, the Council has recognised the importance of strengthening the measures to combat the employment of those persons in order to combat illegal immigration and undeclared work. Since that objective, namely to combat illegal immigration by acting against the employment pull factor, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, on 18 June 2009, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2009/52/EC providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals. The aim of that directive is to counteract illegal immigration by acting against the employment pull factor, an aim which both institutions agreed could not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and therefore required a European directive. As far as sanctions are concerned, these should include in particular the employer’s contribution to the costs of returning illegally employed third-country nationals, with the possibility of reduced sanctions where the employer is a natural person who employs an illegally staying third-country national for his or her private purposes. The measures include, among other things, simplified procedures for employers, to enable the Member States to check the validity of residence permits or to check for forged documents. The Member States must take the measures necessary to comply with this directive by 20 July 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0529"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) According to the latest figures published by the European Commission (September 2010 interim forecast), gross domestic product (GDP) growth is forecast at 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2010. The figures confirmed for the first and second quarters of 2010 show that the rate of GDP growth in the 27 EU Member States was 0.3% and 0.7% respectively (the Council has not adopted a position on the issue of the recession). These figures would seem to indicate, according to a widespread definition of the recession, that the EU is no longer in recession.</p>
<p>However, looking to the future, a fall in GDP growth is forecast in the second half of 2010, due to the anticipated slowdown in the global economy. Consequently, the challenge for the future is to ensure that the EU continues to consolidate its growth while guaranteeing the strength and viability of public finances. This effort should be aimed at stabilising debt levels, and subsequently reducing them, in order to restore them initially to pre-crisis levels, and then to bring them within the limits laid down by the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>The Member States and the EU have made a huge contribution in budgetary terms to support the financial sector and the real economy, something which has naturally led to an increase in government deficits. These necessary and timely contributions have played an extremely important role in preventing a more serious crisis, while laying the foundations for future growth. Nevertheless, the crisis has shown that sound budgets are not enough to guarantee sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>The package agreed by the Task Force, when validated by the European Council of 28 and 29 October 2010, will be the biggest reform of the Economic and Monetary Union since the euro was created.</p>
<p>The recommendations and concrete proposals contained in the report of the Task Force are aimed in particular at implementing a surveillance mechanism, as a macroeconomic pendant of the budget-focused Pact, in order to create an early warning system to detect the risk of real estate bubbles or of unsustainable patterns on the balance of payments, or strong divergences in competitiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0534"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Faced with the unacceptable level of youth unemployment, ‘Youth on the Move’ is one of the flagship initiatives forming part of the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, adopted by the European Council on 17 June 2010. However, the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy concerns the entire population, with particular emphasis on women and men aged 20-64, the employment rate of whom is intended to increase to 75% under the strategy.</p>
<p>The Member States are responsible, in the first instance, for drafting and implementing their employment policies and, through those policies, they must contribute, among other things, to the achievement of the objectives laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Europe 2020 strategy is based on a set of consistent guidelines on employment issues and broad economic policy issues.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010, in accordance with Article 148 TFEU and on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council, the Council adopted the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, as part of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>In this regard, Guideline 7 ‘Increasing labour market participation of women and men, reducing structural unemployment and promoting job quality’ emphasises that ‘employment services play an important role in activation and matching’ and that ‘such services should be open to all’.</p>
<p>Guideline 8 ‘Developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs and promoting lifelong learning’ reminds the Member States that initial education and vocational training must be complemented with effective incentives for lifelong learning for those who are not in employment, thus ensuring every adult the chance to retrain or to move one step up in their qualification. In particular, efforts should focus on supporting those with low and obsolete skills and on increasing the employability of older workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Guideline 9 ‘Improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education’ provides that the Member States should invest efficiently in education and training systems notably to raise the skill level of the EU’s workforce, allowing it to meet the rapidly changing needs of modern labour markets. In line with the lifelong learning principles, action should cover all sectors (from early childhood education and schools through to higher education, vocational education and training, as well as adult learning). Reforms should aim to ensure the acquisition of the key competencies that every individual needs for success in a knowledge-based economy, notably in terms of employability, lifelong learning and information and communication technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0535"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council is fully aware that the wrongful removal or retention of a child is a distressing and potentially harmful experience for the child concerned.</p>
<p>The Council recognises that the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is a highly important international instrument, which, it must be stressed, has enabled many child abduction cases to be solved since its adoption. Like the honourable Member, the Council is anxious to see this convention applied effectively, for the benefit of the children concerned.</p>
<p>The Council would point out that the European Union as such is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention. The Council notes, however, that the Member States, which are all contracting parties, exchange views and experiences within the framework of Special Commissions convened at regular intervals by the Hague Conference in order to monitor the practical operation of the convention.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council would also point out that the 1980 Convention was supplemented, in 1996, by another convention adopted by the Hague Conference. It should be mentioned that, in connection with the implementation of the latter convention, the Member States have cooperated closely in creating a practical guide of which some parts are specifically aimed at providing guidelines on the handling of child abduction cases.</p>
<p>As for the benefit to be gained from Member States coordinating their approaches to cases of child abduction, the Council would point out that such coordination already exists. Indeed, in their dealings with each other the Member States must apply Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility. This Brussels IIa Regulation contains, among other things, rules of jurisdiction on child abduction, in particular with regard to judgments requiring the return of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where he or she was habitually resident.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0536"></a>

<p>(FR) Following the deterioration in Greece’s macroeconomic and budgetary situation in 2010, the Council addressed some recommendations to Greece inviting it to adopt appropriate measures to reduce its budget deficit and to implement the necessary structural reforms.</p>
<p>Thus, on 10 May and 7 September 2010, the Council addressed two Decisions to Greece with a view to reinforcing and deepening fiscal surveillance and giving notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation of excessive debt. The two Decisions set out the main elements of the economic programme that Greece will have to implement, and which reflects the key conditions attached to financial assistance.</p>
<p>The financial support programme for Greece has been agreed and implemented by the Member States of the euro area outside the EU treaties. It consists of a package of bilateral loans granted individually by those Member States of the euro area that are participating in the programme.</p>
<p>The conditions attached to the bilateral loans were the subject of a specific loan agreement between the Member States providing financial support and Greece, to which the Memorandum of Understanding is annexed. The Memorandum lays down the loan disbursement conditions.</p>

<p>At the end of 2009, the European Council decided that the EU and its Member States would contribute financing on an annual basis to adaptation to climate change in developing countries, in the form of ‘fast-start funding’ of EUR 2.4 billion per annum, for the period 2010-2012.</p>
<p>This sum corresponds to less than half what Parliament considered to be the necessary minimum for the period concerned (EUR 5-7 billion). It represents approximately 2% of what the EU itself estimates to be the annual costs of mitigation and adaptation for the period between 2012 and 2020. It also represents less than 1% of the value of the external debt of all of the African countries (on 2006 figures).</p>
<p>Can the Council state what amounts have been channelled so far to developing countries as 'fast-start funding' for the period 2010-2012? What sums will be transferred over the next two years? What concrete forms will this funding take? Is the Council considering the possibility of increasing the funding?</p>
<p>Does the Council not believe that the external debt and debt servicing of the least developed countries represents an enormous constraint on their development, which has already obliged them to dedicate a large proportion of their resources to servicing a dent which should, surely, now be written off?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) On 17 November 2010, the Council approved the report on ‘fast-start funding’ in accordance with the political agreement concluded at the December 2009 European Council<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The confirmed total amount of funding to be channelled to developing countries as ‘fast-start funding’ for the year 2010 is EUR 2.2 billion. A total of EUR 7.2 billion has been set aside for the entire period 2010-2012. These commitments confirm the EU Member States’ compliance with the Copenhagen Agreement.</p>
<p>The Member States have made considerable progress in implementing the commitments for 2010. A non-exhaustive list of projects has been drawn up and disseminated by the Council. The Council will draft annual reports on ‘fast-start funding’ for the next two years.</p>
<p>The Council has called on the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee to update the data in order to present the most comprehensive information possible at the Cancun Conference.</p>
<p>The Council has made no provision to increase the sums laid down in paragraph 1. The Council merely checks that the Member States are honouring their commitments. Since the ‘fast-start funding’ is a set of commitments made by the Member States, it is possible that some Member States will decide to increase their contributions.</p>
<p>EU action to mitigate or cancel the debt of developing countries is carried out as part of the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative and of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).</p>
<p>In its Conclusions of 11 November 2008<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Council reaffirmed the EU’s will to take action to help restore and preserve debt sustainability in low-income countries, in particular by acting, where possible in a coordinated manner, to prevent unsustainable lending behaviour by lenders which have not contributed to alleviating the burden of poor countries.</p>
<p>The EU is also committed to collectively provide technical assistance to strengthen the debt management capacities of debtor nations, and to assist efficient debt negotiations with non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors and commercial creditors.</p>
<p>The EU also stresses the importance of supporting enhanced democratic oversight regarding both the debt to be contracted in borrowing countries and the use of resources freed up through debt relief.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) South Africa is participating, along with the other countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) – Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland – in the negotiations on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). In this respect a new impetus can be observed in 2010.</p>
<p>Indeed, during the third EU-South Africa Summit, which took place on 28 September 2010, the political leaders engaged in frank and open discussions on the EU-SADC EPA and, at the same time, reaffirmed their will and determination to conclude negotiations on an Economic Partnership Agreement that enhances the trade and economic relations between the SADC and the EU.</p>
<p>The leaders welcomed the timetable of negotiations planned until the end of the year. They urged both sides to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion of all remaining issues.</p>
<p>Our shared objective to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2010 is certainly ambitious, but it is within our reach. It will, of course, require effort, a serious commitment and a spirit of compromise from both partners.</p>
<p>Since the Summit, the negotiators have already met and will meet again. I am convinced that, thanks to the political momentum provided by the Summit, the negotiators will be able to find a solution to the outstanding issues.</p>
<p>South Africa is the biggest economy in the region, and it must therefore play a leading role. I am confident about the prospects of concluding an agreement by the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0551"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Communication ‘A ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe’ (SMA), adopted by the Commission on 25 June 2008, aims to place SMEs at the heart of policy-making (‘Think Small First’), to increase their capacity to create jobs within the EU and to stimulate their competitiveness within the single market and the world markets alike.</p>
<p>On 1 December 2008, the Council adopted conclusions approving the Commission’s approach and calling on the Commission and the Member States to ensure its implementation and ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>In its report of 15 December 2009, the Commission outlined the progress made in implementing the SBA and announced its intention to publish a communication in December 2010, once it had consulted representatives of SME professional bodies and the competent public authorities. The Council is awaiting this communication so as to decide on what follow-up action, if any, to take.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Belgian Presidency, the Council has made progress on matters of great importance for SMEs: the functioning of the internal market and the ‘Single Market Act’ project; the new innovation strategy; the concrete measures for European tourism approved by the Council; and the simplification of European research programmes to enable innovative SMEs to access financing more quickly.</p>
<p>We have had success: the adoption, in conjunction with the European Parliament, of the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions is a huge success as far as SMEs are concerned, and we welcome the European Parliament’s unfailing spirit of cooperation, which has made this outcome possible.</p>
<p>The Council would also point out that the work in relation to the consolidation and appropriate regulation of the financial sector is being undertaken with the aim of improving access to capital for SMEs, the businesses most affected by the credit crunch.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0553"></a>

<p>(FR) The EU-US Summit on 20 November was a great success. The discussions between Presidents Obama, Van Rompuy and Barroso were of a very high quality.</p>
<p>On the economy, the European Union and the United States discussed the results of the G20 summit in Seoul, and the contribution the European Union and the United States can make to securing a sustainable and balanced recovery and to creating jobs through structural financial market reform and fiscal consolidation which promotes growth.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States stressed the need to fully tap into the potential of transatlantic commerce to boost growth and generate jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union and the United States recognise the central role of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) in achieving these objectives, and they tasked the TEC to develop a transatlantic innovation agenda to stimulate growth and create jobs in areas such as clean energy, e-health, information and communication, and other emerging technologies. The TEC is expected to report on progress in these areas in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States emphasised that they stand by the commitments they made in Copenhagen last December to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union and the United States agreed to promote a positive outcome at the Cancun conference.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to collaboration and coordinated action on development. The European Union and the United States pledged to continue cooperation on food security, climate change and the Millennium Development Goals, including health, within the framework of the EU-US Dialogue on Development.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States also welcomed their deepening partnership on a wide range of transnational security issues that affect their citizens. Recognising this, as well as the growing challenge of cyber-security and cyber-crime, the European Union and the United States established an EU-US Working Group on networks and cyber-security, which will report progress within a year. We aim to facilitate transatlantic travel for the citizens of our 27 Member States and of the United States while pursuing the vital task of maintaining security, and now look forward to similar success in our forthcoming negotiations on a Passenger Name Record agreement. We will also continue our work towards negotiating a comprehensive agreement on data protection, with the aim of facilitating cooperation between our respective services while guaranteeing a high level of protection of our citizens’ privacy. We are also committed to extending our partnership on countering violent extremism, in particular by sharing research and good practice and by enhancing cooperation on assistance to third countries at risk.</p>
<p>Finally, we also discussed our common efforts to promote security in certain countries across the world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0559"></a>

<p>(FR) In 2008<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the European Parliament called on the Commission to propose an EU programme in the field of sport, as well as preparatory actions in that field. The preparatory actions, which may only run over three consecutive years, have been proposed by the Commission for 2009, 2010 and 2011: the objective of these actions is to prepare future EU actions in the field of sport with a view to implementing the provisions of the Treaty in this field.</p>
<p>The Council has had no involvement in these preparatory actions, which are the responsibility of the Commission and of the European Parliament and have been financed from the margins of a European Parliament budgetary heading since December 2009, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Under Article 165 TFEU, the EU is granted a new power to support, coordinate and supplement Member States’ action in the field of sport, in particular with regard to social inclusion and integration, sport for health and volunteering.</p>
<p>On 10 May 2010, the Council held a general debate on the future of EU sport policy, thus helping the Commission in its efforts to draft future practical proposals aimed at implementing the new provisions of the Treaty. The following were designated as priority areas by the Council: social inclusion in and through sport, health-enhancing physical activity, education and training in sport, the fight against doping, good governance, structured dialogue with the sports movement, and the sport economy and sport statistics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 18 and 19 November 2010, the Council, acting on an initiative of the Belgian Presidency, adopted a resolution on the structured dialogue on sport, conclusions on the fight against doping and conclusions on the role of sport in society.</p>
<p>Although the Commission intends to propose a new framework, on the basis of an EU programme on policy-making and cooperation in sport in the coming years aimed at implementing the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon in that field, to date no specific proposal (whether a ‘mini’ programme covering the period 2012-2013 or a comprehensive programme covering the period 2014-2020) has been submitted to the Council by the Commission.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The exchange rate should simply be a reflection of the economic fundamentals of a currency. If this mechanism is to work properly, countries must refrain from competitive devaluations.</p>
<p>In an effort to further strengthen the economic pillar of EMU, the European Council of 28-29 October 2010 focused on sustainable growth, employment and competitiveness, which are the fundamentals of the euro area. Special emphasis was placed on fiscal consolidation plans, financial regulatory reform, social cohesion, job creation and the need for further structural reforms.</p>
<p>In preparation for the Seoul G20 summit, the October 2010 European Council discussed the priorities which the representatives of the EU and the EU Member States which are members of the G20 would promote there. Particular attention was given to the issue of rebalancing world growth, and the European Union stressed the need to avoid all forms of protectionism and to avoid engaging in exchange-rate moves aimed at gaining short-term competitive advantages.</p>
<p>The Seoul Summit took due note of these points made by the EU and the Member States that participated in it, and the G20 leaders adopted the ‘Seoul Action Plan’, in which they pledge to ensure ongoing recovery and sustainable growth and to enhance the stability of financial markets, including enhancing exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, and refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0526"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission intends to propose a Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving. This Recommendation will set out basic guidelines for coherent, comprehensive and evidence based policies against early school leaving. It will provide a reference framework to assist Member States to develop more effective policies against early school leaving, to support them in their implementation, and so to lead to a significant reduction in the rate of early school leaving in all Member States.</p>
<p>Early school leaving is a complex phenomenon and causes leading to drop-out differ between Member States, regions and localities. The proposed Council Recommendation will add value to Member States’ efforts by supporting them in developing policies that identify the causes of and address early school leaving in a lifelong learning perspective, tackle it as a phenomenon that cuts across several related policy areas, involve all stakeholders, and make policy interventions more systematic and consistent.</p>
<p>The Recommendation itself forms part of a wider ambition to improve education and training in Europe. It is part of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative 'Youth on the Move', plays an important role within the 'Agenda for new skills and jobs' and will be implemented in the context of the Open Method of Coordination in education and training (Education and Training 2020 programme and its predecessor).</p>
<p>Both the Lifelong Learning Programme and the European Social Fund have important roles to play in supporting measures to reduce early school leaving. The future funding for both instruments after 2013 will be determined in the context of the future financial perspectives and the adoption of specific new legal bases for them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0554"></a>

<p>(EN) The only means to increase the overall number of beneficiaries of the Erasmus Mundus programme, given the full absorption rates of existing funding, would lie in a budget increase. Any occasional increases in funding have been quickly absorbed by stakeholders and have been quickly turned into deliverable and measurable outputs on the ground through, for example, an increase in the number of scholarships or joint programmes.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2004, the European Commission has put in place measures to ensure a satisfactory participation of EU higher education institutions in the programme. Every year it has organised information days in Brussels, which are specifically addressed to universities interested in participating in the programme. In addition, national information days take place yearly in the different Member States. The Commission also organises Erasmus Mundus coordinators meetings to share information and exchange good practice.</p>
<p>Extensive information is also provided on a website, including a detailed description of the programme's actions, information on the ways to apply and relevant documents (programme decision, programme guide, call for proposals, financial and administrative handbooks, and so on).</p>
<p>Considering the very high application rate by EU higher education institutions and the consequently rather low success rate of applications (around 13% for joint masters courses and 7% for joint doctorate programmes), the Commission does not consider it necessary to increase the level and the scope of its promotional actions within the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the participation of individual European students in the programme, there have also been no difficulties in absorbing the entire budget for EU scholarships. However, a higher application rate would have ensured stronger competition and subsequently a broader choice of more qualified beneficiaries. The Commission, with the support of the Erasmus National Agencies, has therefore launched an information campaign on the opportunities that the programme offers EU students, including by providing information to organisations such as all Erasmus University Charter holders, university associations<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, student associations<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Erasmus coordinators’ association.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The financing of culture in the EU is currently achieved through various financial mechanisms dealing with exchanges and cooperation in cultural matters, dialogue between cultures and the strengthening of this sector. The EU’s Europe 2020 strategy focuses on economic growth based on a knowledge society, green industry, etc. There are fears that this strategy regards culture as one part of economic growth. Cultural identity is one of the fundamental values of the EU and cannot, by its very nature, be measured in terms of quantitative indicators. Projects which aim to combine current financial mechanisms are cause for concern, as the programmes vary greatly, even though they are concerned with culture. Efforts to merge cultural programmes and the Citizenship Programme are another worrying trend, as the resulting projects have little artistic value.</p>

<p>(EN) The European Union supports cultural cooperation activities within the framework of its Culture Programme, running from 2007 until 2013. This Programme aims to enhance the cultural area shared by Europeans through the development of cultural cooperation projects between cultural organisations from different countries participating in the Programme.</p>
<p>The thrust of this strand, which receives over three quarters of the overall Programme budget, is to help organisations, such as theatres, museums, professional associations, research centres, universities, cultural institutes and public authorities to cooperate so that different sectors can work together and extend their cultural and artistic reach across borders.</p>
<p>It is too early to say anything on the specific financing mechanism of future cultural initiatives, for which proposals will only be made in the second half of 2011. However it is already clear that the formulation of any programme proposal will take into account the objectives and priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>In that light, the Commission is looking at a number of issues which will contribute to designing future initiatives in the field of culture.</p>
<p>The mid-term evaluation of the current Culture Programme is currently being finalised and will include recommendations for the future. In addition, a public online consultation is currently underway asking for views on future actions to promote culture. More than 160 responses have already been received and the Commission will take them into account when reflecting on a new culture programme. The consultation will remain open until 15 December 2010.</p>
<p>Following the consultation, a debate with stakeholders will take place in February 2011 to enable them to express their views in more detail and to discuss the various options for future initiatives.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully understands the honourable Member’s concerns regarding the allegations of corrupt practices and recalls that he raised some of the same issues in his question <a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2009-0320_EN.html">H-320/09</a><a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to which he received a response in October 2009.</p>
<p>Action by judicial authorities comes under the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission’s responsibility in anti-corruption matters focuses on prevention, legislation and monitoring. Should the matters to which he refers concern EU funds, the Commission would recall that Member States are required under Treaty obligations to take all necessary measures to protect the EU’s financial interests. They are also obliged under the relevant sectoral regulations to notify the Commission of any cases of fraud, irregularity or any other illegal activities involving EU funds which they have detected.</p>
<p>As was already explained in its response to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2009-0320_EN.html">H-320/09</a>, European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may intervene when a corruption case involving EU funds is brought to light, but on a more general level the Commission may act through legislative initiatives, intervention in international fora, dialogue with the Member States, etcetera in order to develop efficient tools to combat such activity. The Commission has not been inactive in this last area. As foreseen in the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission envisages presenting in April 2011 a Communication on a comprehensive policy against corruption in Member States, including the establishment of an evaluation mechanism as well as presenting modalities of cooperation with the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Commission has been informed by the OLAF that the number of current cases with which it is presently concerned is quite limited. The following is an overview of the two cases, both of which involve only Siemens and not any of the other companies mentioned in the question:</p>
<p>a case investigated by OLAF and closed in the last quarter of 2003, involving external aid, is in judicial follow-up in Germany. OLAF is following closely the judicial proceedings in that country;</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has recently outlined its vision concerning the taxation of the financial sector in a Communication<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted on 7 October 2010.</p>
<p>Globally, a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) could be an appropriate option as a revenue raiser in particular to provide financing for global policy goals. For it to work effectively and fairly, participating countries should try to come to an agreement on global financing tools that can be acceptable to all. The Commission is committed to continuing to work with its international partners, in particular in the G-20, to reach such an agreement. In the Commission's view the FTT is less suited for a unilateral introduction at EU-level because of risks, such as relocation and reduced liquidity, are high and would undermine the ability to generate revenue. Thus, the Commission is currently exploring the possibility to introduce a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) at EU level, as an alternative instrument. The Commission will conduct an Impact Assessment in order to be able to propose, where appropriate, tax designs, aimed at minimising distortions or adverse effects on the economy and the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member points out, the EU-Turkey Customs Union has contributed largely to the substantial increase of the trade volume between the two partners. The Commission is also aware of the fact that counterfeit products and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Turkey constitute significant problems in the EU-Turkey trade relations.</p>
<p>To address the above shortcomings, the Commission proposed in April 2008 to Turkey the establishment of a joint working group on IPR issues. The aim of the working group will be to discuss in depth issues related inter alia with the enhancement of IPR enforcement capacity in Turkey. After long hesitations, Turkey accepted recently the establishment of the working group and appointed the relevant coordinating authority. The Commission is now expecting Turkey's formal response to its proposal to hold the first meeting of the working group and start discussing substantial IPR matters.</p>
<p>Moreover, the establishment of the EU-Turkey working group on IPR issues and the successful engagement of Turkey into an IPR dialogue is a key requirement for progress under the relevant negotiation chapter ‘Intellectual property law’ (chapter 7). Therefore, in the framework of discussions with regard to IPR chapter, the Commission is monitoring progress of Turkey towards further alignment and implementation of the IPR acquis as well as its enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the framework of EU-Turkey Customs Union, the Commission is urging Turkey to comply with the provisions of Article 31 of Decision 1/95 of the EU-Turkey Association Council establishing the Customs Union, which invites Turkey to improve the effective protection of IPR in order to secure a level of protection equivalent to that in the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0531"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the consolidation process which took place along the food supply chain, and agrees that this situation is liable to give rise to significant imbalances in bargaining powers between contracting parties. The Commission has identified in its Communication on the food supply chain of 2009<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as well as in its Retail Market Monitoring Report of July 2010<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the existence of situations where some actors face large companies that are often their only channel for accessing the market. It should be stressed that this situation is found throughout the supply chain and is liable to affect both producers that have a weak bargaining position vis à vis retailers – specifically those of non differentiated products, including farmers who produce mostly undifferentiated commodities - and also retailers that do not have access to certain branded products sold by large multinational producers.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that imbalances in bargaining power in certain specific conditions can lead to the imposition of unfair commercial practices by one of the contracting parties on the other. Unfair commercial practices can have a negative impact and limit a company's capacity to invest in innovation and quality of products, be they food or non food products or services.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that in general imbalances of bargaining power resulting from the unequal size of contracting parties are not per se problematic in competitive markets, as the lower costs achieved through bargaining tend to be passed through downstream market chain to the ultimate benefit of consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently exploring how to address the issue and will come forward with an initiative geared towards business-to-business relations aiming at protecting the different operators in the supply chain against unfair commercial practices. As far as food is concerned, the Commission has established an Expert Platform on Business-to-Business (B2B) Contractual Practices in the Food Supply Chain to collect information on possible unfair commercial practices. This Platform will report to the High Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would refer the honourable Member to the Commission Statement on the sludge catastrophe in Hungary (plenary session of 19 October 2010).</p>
<p>The acute impact of the accident is mainly due to the very big amount and high alkalinity of the leaked sludge. The longer term impact on the environment is likely to be confined to a limited territory in Hungary. The alkaline pollution also reached the Danube River, but due to the safety measures taken by the Hungarian authorities (dilution of the pollution with gypsum and acidic materials), this water body did not suffer any significant harmful effects.</p>
<p>The Commission received notification through the early warning system of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR). This information has been sent to all countries in the Danube basin in order to allow them to take the necessary protective measures to safeguard their water catchments. The Commission has been in contact with Slovakia, Romania and the ICPDR. Based on their sampling results cross-border effects are likely to be minimal.</p>
<p>The Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) was in close contact with Hungary from the outset of the emergency and offered assistance in case of need. Information has been shared with all Member States on the disaster and its possible effects on the population and the environment.</p>
<p>On 7 October 2010, at 8 p.m., the Hungarian Government activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism by issuing a request for assistance to the MIC. The request was for a team of 5 experts with strong field experience in preventing/mitigating damage from alkali sludge on flora and fauna, and decontamination of agricultural land. The EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to Hungary for 1 week and delivered a number of recommendations for measures agreed upon with the Hungarian authorities to further enhance the remedial and recovery plan for the affected area.</p>
<p>Industrial accidents are normally not covered by the European Union Solidarity Fund. The Fund may provide assistance in case of natural disasters and when the damages exceeds 0,6% of Gross National Income following an application from an affected Member State. Damage for which there is liability may not be compensated by the Solidarity Fund. Operational programmes co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund might contain provisions for prevention of disasters and remove risks for further development. However the polluter pays principle is to be applied, before a project could be approved for funding under any of these programmes.</p>
<p>The ‘polluter pays’ principle likewise applies to rural development policy. Nevertheless, Council Regulation (EC) n° 1698/2005<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> foresees possibilities to grant support for 'Restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and introducing appropriate prevention actions'. This measure is not programmed in the New Hungarian Rural Development Programme (NHRDP), but it could still be introduced if the Member State requests so. In addition, the measure 'Restoring forestry potential in forests damaged by natural disasters and fire and introducing appropriate prevention actions' provides a similar support for the affected forestry sector. This measure is included in the NHRDP. Support under both measures can be provided under the condition that the catastrophe has to be recognised as a natural disaster.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member pointed out, in November 2009 the Commission decided to refer Bulgaria to the European Court of Justice for the failure to establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations as required by the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in April 2010 Bulgaria submitted to the Commission a major project application ‘Integrated System of Municipal Waste Treatment Facilities for Sofia Municipality’.</p>
<p>With regard to whether the application made by Bulgaria meets the financial and technical criteria laid down by the Commission, and whether the Commission considers the technology selected to fulfil all the necessary requirements from an environmental and financial-economic standpoint with a view to co-financing of the project, it should be pointed out that the technical assessment of Bulgaria's application by the Commission has confirmed the viability of the first substantial components of the new waste management system, namely an adequate long-term landfill capacity and the facilities for composting. At the same time, in view of the need for more consistent and up-to date waste stream data and for additional assurance regarding the cost-efficiency of the system, certain parts of the submitted project will have to be reworked. In this regard, while the upgrade of the integrated waste management system should be seen as one project, the Commission considers that time can be gained by implementing this project in two phases, with a first phase to start immediately and a second phase to be implemented once the additional analyses have been completed. This model should give the opportunity to the Bulgarian authorities to develop a well-functioning waste management system that is viable in the long term both from an environmental and economic efficiency point of view.</p>
<p>With regard to your question on the infringement proceedings, suspension would require a new Commission's decision amending the decision from November 2009 to refer Bulgaria to the Court. However, in line with its practice in such cases, the adoption of a decision regarding the first phase of the project and the rapid start of the construction of the first-phase infrastructure should be sufficient for the Commission to suspend the pending infringement procedure, which will provide Bulgaria with the necessary time to prepare an environmentally compliant and long term cost-efficient second phase of the Sofia Municipal Waste Management Project.</p>
<p>With regard to the storage of waste in the city of Sofia, until such time as the new processing factory is constructed and enters into operation, the Commission will work together with the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that the storage of waste complies with the main requirements of the EU waste acquis. The Waste Framework Directive requires MS to ensure that storage is taking place without endangering human health and without harming the environment. The Waste Framework Directive also contains specific provisions on the storage of hazardous waste. In addition, the requirements of the Landfill Directive apply to the storage of waste prior to recovery for a period of three years or longer and the storage of waste prior to disposal for a period of one year or longer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In September 2009, the French railways company (SNCF), as part of the ongoing ‘plan Veron’, put forward a master plan outlining the main parameters for the development of freight transport over the years to come, which includes withdrawing about 60 % of single wagon services. However, this traffic currently makes up 42 % of the volume of rail freight and has great potential for development.</p>
<p>In practice, this decision will lead to 255 000 wagon loads of freight being diverted to road transport and in the short term will reduce the volume transported by a third in comparison with 2008. In total, this will be equivalent to increasing road traffic by 1 200 000 lorries, which, according to a study carried out by SNCF, means 300 000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. These environmental risks will inevitably go hand in hand with job losses, which are unacceptable at this time of crisis.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the situation and developments in single wagonload traffic in France and other Member States, which have been aggravated by the recent economic crisis. Single wagonload services in many Member States accounts for an important part of total rail freight traffic and its discontinuation in some countries could jeopardize the viability of this kind of traffic in other parts of Europe, where railway undertakings are still committed to it. This would have a negative impact on transport options for shippers and result in undesired modal-shift effects on a European level. The Commission therefore considers single wagonload services as an important part of European rail freight.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that it plans to launch a comprehensive study on single wagonload traffic in 2011 in order to identify possible policy options. The study is intended to address questions related to the ‘last mile’ (industrial spurs, freight terminals), freight flow consolidation and deconsolidation, train formation facilities and services as well as regulatory issues related to these.

<p>In the Civil Enforcement section of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), paragraph 1 of Article 2.X: Injunctions allows judicial authorities to issue an order (injunction) against a party, or a third party, to ‘prevent infringing goods from entering into the channels of commerce’. This injunction power is considerably different from that existing under the EU acquis (Article 9 of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive (Directive 2004/48/EC)), which permits injunctions ‘to prevent any imminent infringement’. Furthermore, the third parties need to be involved in the infringement (‘against an intermediary whose services are being used’). The ACTA text essentially eliminates the thresholds for injunction powers that exist under the EU acquis.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to clarify that Article 2.X.1 ACTA (page 6) refers to injunctions in the sense of measures taken when the court establishes an infringement (‘… order against a party to desist from an infringement’), while Article 9 of the Enforcement Directive refers to provisional and precautionary measures (also described in EU law as interlocutory injunctions, hence the possible misunderstanding), which are temporary measures taken before a final decision is issued by the court. This is the reason why these two provisions make reference to different requirements, or ‘thresholds’.</p>
<p>The provision dealing with injunctions in Article 2.X.1 ACTA (page 6) must be compared with the equivalent provision in Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, while the provision addressing provisional measures in Article 9 of the Enforcement Directive is equivalent to the provision in Article 2.5.1(a) of ACTA (page 8).

The Commission ensured coordinated actions notably through the organisation of a joint mission with experts from the three Member States to the facilities of the company where the first steps of the process for the production of GM Amflora potatoes take place. The main objective of the mission was to gather more information on the possible sources of the admixture for all lots of Amflora potatoes cultivated in 2010. This coordination will be pursued in order to ensure that there will be no contamination in the future.</p>
<p>On the basis of available information, the Commission considers that the actions taken by the three Member States following the admixture of GM Amflora potatoes with the other non-authorised GM potatoes are sufficient. The Commission is examining further options to reinforce monitoring of environmental effects of GM crops. This will provide proper feedback so as to enable them to enhance their assessments.</p>

With a view to stepping up worker protection, Directive 2009/148/EC<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> consolidates various asbestos-related legislative instruments to make the legislation easier to understand and implement. In particular, Article 14 of that directive makes it an obligation for employers to provide appropriate training for all workers who are, or are likely to be, exposed to dust from asbestos or materials containing asbestos. The transposition and effective implementation of that legislation is the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards further steps or stronger protection measures needed, the Commission is drafting guidelines for workers who are mainly but not exclusively in the construction sector and who may be in contact with and affected by asbestos, with a view to preventing further cases of asbestos contamination and any ensuing asbestos-related diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that the guidelines and related material are disseminated as widely as possible. It is also in contact with professional organisations in the field with a view to gathering evidence and ultimately helping to design the best possible strategy to address the problems posed by asbestos.</p>
<p>The Commission would also draw the honourable Member’s attention to the information available on the website of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, including guidance on asbestos-related safety<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the issue of measures targeted at workers suffering from illnesses related to exposure to asbestos and families of workers who have died as a result of exposure is linked to the recognition of asbestos-related diseases, which is the sole responsibility of the Member States. The EU-level legal instrument of relevance to the recognition of and compensation for asbestos-related diseases is Recommendation 670/2003/EC<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which is not legally binding. Article 2 of that Recommendation specifically acknowledges that the Member States are to determine the criteria for the recognition of each occupational disease in accordance with the national laws or practices in force.</p>

In the framework of the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy, about EUR 3.5 billion are planned to be invested in the rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated land. Based on the principle of shared management, it is up to the Member States and their Managing Authorities to select and implement the co-financed project in line with the priorities set in the relevant Operational Programmes, for instance the rehabilitation of sites or land contaminated with asbestos.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Article 93<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as modified by Regulation 539/2010<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> foresees automatic de-commitment of unused funds by 31 December of the second year for each commitment. Paragraph 2 mentions the exception for some Member States benefiting from the rule as from 31 December of the third year for each commitment. The so-called ‘N+2/ N+3 rule’ works as an incentive for Member States to spend the allocated funds in a timely manner.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the absorption rate does not completely reflect the level of spending on the ground. It only reflects the payment requests submitted by Member States to the Commission for reimbursement of final beneficiaries’ expenses. Moreover, most Member States tend to submit high payment claims towards the end of the year, resulting in some payments executed only the following year. The real level of advancement on the ground is reflected then in the absorption rate with a delay.</p>
<p>Figures as of 8 November 2010 show an average absorption rate for all Member States of 19.3% for the European Regional Development Fund, 18.2% for the Cohesion Fund and 20.0% for the European Social Fund. In the specific case of Lithuania, these figures respectively amount to 34.7%, 29.0% and 27.9%.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that most programmes are reaching cruising speed and the absorption rate is increasing month by month. The Commission is constantly working with Member States to ensure regular and timely submission of payment claims. This works well in the case of Lithuania which regularly submits payment claims to the Commission four times per year.</p>
<p>It is, however, difficult to compare the absorption rate per Member State for the various funds, as the de-commitment rule is applied differently for the various Member States. Lithuania will only be subject to the rule as from ‘N+3’ (i.e. 2011) whereas some Member States already face the risk of de-commitment this year. This has an impact on the spending profile and, consequently, on the absorption rate.</p>
<p>Lithuania’s absorption rate for each fund is higher than the average ‘paid/decided’ for all Member States. The relatively high absorption rate is partly due to payments in favour of financial engineering instruments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has not so far been approached by solar panel installation firms with a view to reaching agreements to install solar or photovoltaic panels on the roofs of its buildings, whether in Brussels or in Luxembourg. The Commission's policy is to install photovoltaic solar panels for its own buildings, where possible, based on the results of feasibility studies. The question whether firms who do the installation free of charge should be used has not been considered so far.</p>
<p>In Brussels, the Commission's new ‘Cornet Leman’ nursery which is to open in early 2011 has been equipped with photovoltaic solar panels (over a roof surface area of approximately 70 square meters) which will provide 9.89 kW peak power. In addition, the Commission is currently examining the possibility of installing photovoltaic solar panels on the roofs of other buildings and has already identified two buildings where this appears feasible (Rue Demot 24 and Rue du Luxembourg 46). Further verifications still have to be carried out before the Commission can proceed in line with the relevant procurement rules. Feasibility studies show that the installation of photovoltaic solar panels is expected to provide a return on investment after approximately eight to ten years, taking into account the local electricity production as well as the various support mechanisms available such as investment aid, green certificates, etc. The final return on investment can of course be affected by changes in these support mechanisms. In Luxembourg no panels have so far been fitted on any Commission building. On the other hand, the Commission has made arrangements in Luxembourg to be supplied exclusively with ‘green’ electricity, from renewable sources. It should be pointed out in this connection that all the Commission's buildings in Luxembourg are rented, with the (partial) exception of the EUROFORUM building, in respect of which it has the right/option to purchase.</p>
<p>In order to assess the overall potential for reducing the Commission's energy bills and/or its carbon footprint, individual studies have to be made of the possible sites which would be adequate and of the energy potential of any solar panel installation. These studies will have to look at matters such as the characteristics of the roof concerned, the possible presence of other equipment on the roof and the physical environment of the building concerned etc. At this early stage, it is not yet possible therefore to give an overall estimate of the impact this long term project might have on the Commission's energy bills or on its carbon footprint.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0565"></a>

It seems that some Member States are trying to establish a second standard for the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. These actions could undermine the EU regulatory framework for medicines, which requires a long and costly process for market authorisation. These practices also threaten the single market in pharmaceuticals. It is contrary to single market principles to distort competition between those pharmaceutical companies that undertake the proper clinical research and tests to secure authorisations and those that disregard them.</p>

<p>In August 2010, EASA submitted an opinion to the Commission on new rules for pilot licensing. The proposal seeks to improve aviation safety.</p>
<p>EASA wishes among other things to ensure that all pilots flying in the EU have a pilot’s licence issued in the EU. Accordingly, persons holding a licence from the USA, for example, would not necessarily still be entitled to fly in the EU.</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s view of this proposal?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Regulation EC 216/2008<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted by the European Parliament and Council requires pilots residing in the EU and involved in the operation of an aircraft into the EU to comply with the European licensing requirements. Those requirements may be satisfied by the acceptance of licences issued by third countries in case of operating non EU-registered aircraft.</p>
<p>After extensive consultation with stakeholders, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has made a proposal (opinion) to the Commission on pilot licences issued by third country authorities, which reproduces largely the standards commonly applied in Member States and developed previously by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). This opinion also contains a proposal for the acceptance of licences issued by or on behalf of third countries, including a proposal for the conversion of third country licences issued in compliance with ICAO Annex 1. This proposal will be further discussed in the framework of the Committee established by Article 65(1) of Regulation 216/2008.</p>
<p>Beyond the current proposal for third country licence conversions the Commission takes the opportunity to recall that the recognition of non-EU licences could be simplified in case bilateral safety agreements between the EU and third countries are put in place. Such agreements, still to be ratified, have already been established with the United States, Canada and Brazil.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
