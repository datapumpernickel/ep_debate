<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipietz (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, it is exactly five years since the European Parliament began its dialogue with the European Investment Bank in an own-initiative report. I was already your rapporteur five years ago and I can therefore bear witness to the extraordinary progress those five years have seen in the quality of the dialogue between the European Investment Bank and the European Parliament, in the quality of that dialogue with civil society and in the matching of the European Investment Bank’s policy with the tasks assigned to it since the European Union was formed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to begin by expressing the heartfelt gratitude of all of us who were already present during the last legislative period and, I hope, of all who will now be taking an interest in the European Investment Bank’s work and its contribution to the implementation of European policy. Warm congratulations and thanks, too, to the EIB’s directors with whom we maintained this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a demanding dialogue, a rich dialogue, with genuine interaction on both sides. We have changed our perception of the EIB and the EIB has changed its own perception of its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to take advantage of the few minutes allotted to me to sum up the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ unanimous report and underline the five most salient points of our report, in questioning terms of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we can no longer be content with talking about Lisbon and Gothenburg, we now need to try to make progress in clarifying the objectives. The EIB recognises that it exists to assist European Union policy; it needs to adopt criteria, quantitative indicators, in dialogue with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we in the European Parliament were among those calling most strongly for the European Investment Bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses. However, that can only be done by means of global loans, which are made to banks, and the banks distribute the credits. In this case, we risk losing the ability to check that these loans are consistent with European Union objectives and we need to find a way of checking where these global loans have gone, <span class="italic">ex post facto</span> obviously.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it has to be possible to extend this microcredit policy to an area that is very important in a society that is both a knowledge-based economy and also an ageing economy. I am speaking of third-sector enterprises that provide assistance to individuals and families.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth problem is that a potential conflict emerged during the hearing we held. The European Investment Bank is making a lot of effort to offer cheap long-term loans to local and regional authorities. Attractive as these loans are, however, they obviously come up against the limits imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact. The tendency to get around that difficulty by making loans to private businesses guaranteed by the State obviously introduces an ‘off-balance sheet’ risk. We suggest that the European Investment Bank should emulate the European Central Bank in adopting rules of ethics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point: in the first version of my report we noted the criticism voiced in certain sections of the press, mainly outside the European Union as it happens, regarding possible conflicts of interest involving senior EIB management staff because of their past activities at the head of large private undertakings that might benefit from EIB loans. Since then, the EIB has sent us a whole series of new internal codes designed to avoid such conflicts of interest or at any rate to take account of them by dealing with them before they arise. I have therefore tabled an amendment which I believe has been taken up by all group coordinators or shadow rapporteurs, thanking the European Investment Bank and noting the details it has provided following our vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is working more and more closely with the EIB Group on a wide range of issues, both within and outside the European Union. As a ‘policy driven’ bank, the EIB needs to keep its finger on the pulse of European policy development and to react when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, the EIB has a very important role to play in taking forward the Lisbon Agenda and the European Action for Growth. I would particularly like to highlight, as does Parliament’s report, the Innovation 2010 Initiative, which supports innovation and research and development, and the TEN Infrastructure Facility, which finances TEN projects. The bank’s long experience of infrastructure projects, and therefore its ability to offer expert advice, can and should add value above and beyond the financial advantages conferred by its loans. I would especially welcome the environmental activities of the EIB, particularly its expanded lending for renewable energy projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the Union, the European Investment Bank has expanded its operations with existing partners and also taken on new partners. I would particularly like to highlight the bank’s work in the Mediterranean partner countries, where activities under the FEMIP have grown year-on-year. As Parliament has noted, we will need to ensure that the bank’s future external activities are firmly framed in the context of the Community’s external relations policies. We will take this into account during the work to develop the next set of external lending mandates, which will need to be in place from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report suggests that prudential rules be laid down to ensure that EIB loans do not compromise the sustainability of the Member States’ public debt. I would like to point out that the existing framework under the Stability and Growth Pact provides a detailed and powerful mechanism for ensuring that Member States’ borrowing is undertaken in a sustainable fashion. Of course, you will be aware that we are seeking to enhance the Pact still further. Among the elements of revision of the Pact that have been discussed, there is the need to increase the focus on long-term aspects of public finances, and to take increasingly into account government risks that can lead to increased debt in the future. Specifically on public-private partnerships, the Commission has provided more detailed statistical guidance for recording them in public accounts and has stressed the importance of demonstrating their value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges the good work undertaken by the EIB in recent years to improve its transparency and corporate governance. The new EIB corporate governance statement provides a useful summary of its policies across a range of corporate governance aspects. The Commission encourages the EIB to listen closely to the comments received during the forthcoming public consultation exercise on its public information policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s report and hopes that the fruitful policy dialogue between the European Investment Bank and Parliament will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is wholly justified because, compared to previous years, the EIB has undergone some positive developments, especially in terms of transparency and openness. I should also like, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to congratulate the EIB and particularly its President, Mr Maystadt, even though we recognise that some changes need to be made where supervision is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the EIB’s prudential control is therefore – and with good reason – one of the key subjects in the annual report, and it is one to which, unfortunately, an adequate solution has not yet been found. The question is how prudential control can be best guaranteed in future. I should like to ask the EIB and the Commission to present a view on prudential control by the next annual report. Can that be done?</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the objectives. The emphasis should indeed be on the role which the EIB can play in the Lisbon strategy, in strengthening innovation, as well as research and development. More synergy between the EIB’s and the Commission’s programmes can help considerably, as can cofinancing from the Commission’s programmes for projects, for example, in the framework of the Innovation 2010 initiative, but also vice versa. If the Commission has approved projects and cofinancing is required, it would be good if the EIB were able to contribute financially. I should therefore like to ask the EIB to develop a suitable instrument for this, so that, for example, companies are able to take part in programmes such as CRAFT and Collective Research more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs must be given an even more enhanced role where the use of loans is concerned, because the differences between Member States are significant. I would therefore urge the EIB, during promotion, to involve the SMEs directly and promote credits not only via banks in the Member States, because there appear to be too many differences between the Member States, especially between the new ones. I would like to congratulate you again, and we are happy to support Mr Lipietz’s report in tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The high level of cooperation between Parliament and the EIB during the last five years has been mentioned in this debate. As we know – and the report mentions this – the EIB has been in existence for a long time, indeed since the Communities were founded. Yet it has only been working in collaboration with Parliament for five years and this cooperation, as mentioned by the rapporteur, has been very fruitful and has led to some highly significant developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore say that this story of relative success is worthy of praise, inasmuch as the EIB is one of Europe’s major financial institutions, created by the Member States with the aim of financing investments and the policies needed to implement the main objectives laid down in the Treaties, either directly or by leveraging private funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us naturally points this out, painting the bank’s activities in a wholly positive light, acknowledging that the more it participates in dialogue with Parliament, the greater the effectiveness and transparency of its activities. It must therefore be acknowledged that the Bank’s activities have gradually adapted to the reality of the European economic climate and that the Bank has managed to achieve this adaptation whilst complying in full with its original mandate. It is therefore easy to identify a number of principles, rules, or, if you prefer, suggestions, which the Bank should follow in order to enhance its activities and which will aid understanding of its activities, thereby, without any doubt, helping it to improve its work in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these ideas is that the Bank can and must play an increasingly prominent role in the development of the European economy, particularly during times of recession, focusing its resources and policies on economic growth and cohesion. The second principle is that the EIB should play an important role as a multiplier effect in mobilising private or almost-public funding, encouraging the involvement of all economic operators with acceptable risk levels, either by means of risk capital operations or the granting of guarantees. The third idea is that the Bank must assess the real contribution of its policy on the Lisbon Strategy, which means that the Bank must quantify the results of its actions and immediately disclose those results to the public. The fourth principle is that the Bank’s activities should have a visible and quantifiable effect on job creation and a positive impact on the economic climate, which hinders the full development of small and medium-sized enterprises. The fifth idea is that, given that the Bank must support the European economy as a whole, special emphasis must be placed on scientific research and on high-technology industries. The sixth principle is that all of this is perfectly compatible with the EIB’s firm commitment in its activities to transparency and accountability, which the public demands and which has been consolidated in dialogue with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Lipietz has tabled a very sensible initial proposal, which prepares the groundwork for a high quality final report and a broad consensus, and which, to my mind, deserves this House’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are right behind the European Investment Bank in the positive course that it has been steering for some years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Members have already commented that the EIB is policy-driven and contributes to achieving the EU’s objectives as enshrined in Lisbon and Gothenburg and elsewhere. This is something we wholeheartedly endorse. I should like to emphasise, though, that the EIB’s independence must be maintained and that the EIB must focus on areas where it has added value. It must, above all, help boost developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to a few minor points. Needless to say, the EIB’s activities must be consistent and not undermine each other. Accordingly, it is on the one hand to be welcomed that ever more resources are being set aside for environmental projects, for example involving renewable energy sources – that is excellent – but we should make sure that other projects which have a detrimental effect on the environment are not funded at the same time, for one action would cancel out the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Members have already underlined the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises as Europe’s job generators. I could not agree more, and in that connection, I would like to urge the EIB to concentrate its attention on innovation. A minor detail, and one on which I myself am satisfied, is the Year of Microcredit being mentioned, and on World Women’s Day, it may also be worth adding that investments in small enterprises run by women have proven particularly profitable in other parts of the world. This is something we should make a point of mentioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as some Members have already pointed out, good progress has been made in the areas of transparency and governance. There are, however, still a few points of criticism, including the criticism levelled by Bank Watch and, in fact, by the rapporteur. I can only advise the EIB to take this criticism seriously and continue on this positive course. If that is the case, then we will undoubtedly have even more reason to praise the EIB next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">EIB credits are an easy way to aid the financial development of countries outside the European Union. With that purpose in mind, every year we effect a transfer of funds from the Union’s budget to a special Guarantee Fund, which serves as a guarantee to the EIB in case of defaults on loans. Defaults have been minimal. This being the case, there would be grounds for lowering that share of EIB loans that the Union guarantees by means of the Guarantee Fund. The European Investment Bank itself does not even ask for a 100% guarantee for all the loans it grants. There would be grounds, furthermore, for lowering the percentage figure the transfer of funds from the EU budget to the Guarantee Fund is based on. If we imposed these changes, we could increase the share of EIB lending that can be called development aid to countries not in the Union. We expect the Commission to propose an amendment to the conditions of use of the Guarantee Fund and I would ask the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt, to confirm, on the Bank’s behalf, that these changes could be justified and that the Bank would have nothing against them.</p>
<p class="contents">When global authorisation for granting loans was last changed as a result of EU enlargement, the Union’s neighbouring regions in the north and east did not receive equal treatment. Instead, the Bank leant more in the direction of the Mediterranean region, under the influence of some countries in the south. This kind of situation should be rectified in the future. We cannot accept a situation where Member States do not consider all the Union’s neighbouring regions impartially, but instead, try to favour their own neighbours. The European Investment Bank too should make it possible for all the Union’s neighbours to receive credit in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We saw last year in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with Mrs Ridruejo’s draft report that it is not easy to draft a report on the EIB’s activities. Thinking about European institutions to such extremes is unproductive and does not do any justice to the situation in which the institution has to work. The concise report we are discussing today, however, is balanced, and I have a few remarks to make about it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find regrettable about Mr Lipietz’ report is the lack of attention given to the impact that the granting of credit has on the environment. The EIB’s environmental report is, in my view, too restricted. The granting of credits to businesses must also be assessed in terms of its environmental effect, and that is why I would argue in favour of including an environmental impact report in credit assessments. The rapporteur is right to conclude, in paragraph 20, that greater attention should be paid to improving the auditing to which the EIB is subject. In addition to assessing the credits and the conditions under which they are granted, the EIB’s organisation should also be assessed. Questions should be raised about the organisation’s efficacy and the way it accounts for the resources that have been spent. The EIB is a financial EU institution that has been set up by treaty, and should therefore also be subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors. A good relationship with the Court of Auditors and OLAF can contribute to growing confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to draw your attention to the ethical aspects of granting credits. Are the credits granted by the EIB consistent with the ethical standards that we in this House uphold? Examples that spring to mind are the funding of scientific research and investments in technological development. Are credits granted for research and development for which there is no political or moral support in Parliament? I hope to have these questions answered during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we particularly welcome the reference to microcredits in paragraph 6. When small-scale initiatives are supported, it is possible to deliver a custom-made service and it is gratifying to see that this instrument receives the recognition that it deserves. In this respect, I would call for stress to be laid on the quality of the projects themselves and of the credits granted. The sudden increase in this type of credit involves the risk that the quality of the projects and of the credits is insufficiently questioned. Since careful thought should be given to the type of projects that are eligible, I would call for a firm approach, involving cooperation with institutions that have experience of microcredits. To avoid the instrument becoming a victim of its own success, the EIB must actively commit to a permanently high quality of microcredits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this very moment this House’s bureau is convening, and item 8 on the agenda for its meeting is a highly problematic one. They are planning an assault on the freedom of the press. In a House that claims to the outside world that it defends transparency, its bureau, without negotiating with the Members and without publicising it in any way, intends to enact rules that are a mockery of press freedom and are intended to permit nothing but obsequious and uncritical reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to point that out to the public, and I have previously asked the President to prevent this happening. The same can be said of item 7 on the meeting’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a direct connection between all this and the topic we are discussing now: the annual report of an EU institution, in this instance that of the European Investment Bank. We have seen in past years that its lack of transparency made possible the practice of a very large number of things that have to be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome paragraph 21 of this report, which gives voice to concern about the potential conflicts of interest among the EIB’s management, to which there have been repeated references in the press. I note with interest that an amendment has already been tabled to remove this.</p>
<p class="contents">I still have a very clear recollection of the reports on this subject last summer, for example in the 19 August issue of the <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span>. I can see no evidence of these conflicts of interest having been done away with, nor of there being any transparency about them, and I do not think that we can, at this early stage, be so generous with our praise of the Investment Bank. Generally important though I regard the Bank as being, we can see that the absence of transparency excludes the possibility of trust and democracy, in this House as much as in the EIB. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me make it quite plain that the reason why this House is debating the report on the EIB today is that it lives out democracy, transparency and parliamentary oversight, and our cooperation with the EIB shows how dialogue with us has led not only to improvements and changes in the dialogue itself, but also in the work that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">You are doing a good job, and I would like to thank not only you for that, but also departing Vice-Chairman of the EIB’s Management Committee, Professor Ewald Nowotny, who is also Vice-Rector of Vienna’s University of Economics and Business Administration, for the outstanding work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the EIB? It is a public bank, created by the Treaty on the European Communities to be the most important financial institution for the purpose of realising the European Union’s objectives through its own investments and those promoted by it. It is to be hoped, then, that it is no accident of fate that this week finds us debating, along with the EIB, the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the preparations for the Spring Summit. I regard you as a channel of communication for the Lisbon Strategy, with the task of supporting these very objectives of growth, employment, competitiveness, social cohesion and sustainability, and so I ask you also, in future, to present your reports in line with the Commission’s new Lisbon Strategy and the Member States’ plans of action, taking, in particular, even greater account of our paragraphs 5, 8 and 10, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are at the heart of the European economy and play a central role in job creation.</p>

Point 21 of this resolution does not in any way indicate dissatisfaction on our part with the EIB’s transparency. Moreover, the facts to which Mr Martin refers – the riots and the uproar that people tried to create last year in response to a report about the Investment Bank – appeared to be fabricated.</p>
<p class="contents">In this speech, my primary aim is to emphasise the relationship between the EIB’s activities and the Lisbon strategy. I think that as a variant to the title of the Kok II report ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs,’ the slogan ‘Investments, investments, investments’ should be one of the key phrases for the Lisbon strategy. The EIB plays a crucial role in this. I would, for example, mention the EUR 7.1 billion that was invested in 2004 within the context of the Innovation initiative. These investments are exactly what we need, namely investments in research and development, in education and training, and in ICT developments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the memo that was presented to the ECOFIN Council on 2 February, I noticed that an innovative approach had been adopted with regard to the financial instruments as well. This memo contains a list of ideas which have partly been implemented but are partly still in development. Those ideas intend to guarantee that a number of options at the EIB’s disposal can be deployed and can be used as effectively as possible for microcredits, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for precisely those innovative investments that are needed. I would particularly like to make a point of mentioning <span class="italic">e</span>-technology, assessment centres, and cooperation between different activities under the research framework programme. I also hope that the ECOFIN ministers will establish a connection between investing and the way in which they deal with spending and investments in the Stability and Growth Pact. I also hope that this discussion will be continued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it needs to play an even more active part in realising the Millennium Development Goals in particular, and to show evidence of greater commitment to them. While I am thinking here of the war on poverty in particular, I might add that too little has been said, among the topics addressed by the report, about investments within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Something also has to be said about current capacity for giving aid in rebuilding the regions devastated by the tsunami and the disastrous floods. Effective though it was in media terms for Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to announce up to EUR 1 billion’s worth of aid, to be arranged through the EIB, I would like to take this opportunity to ram the point home that the money will not flow if conditions remain as they are. The EIB itself has pointed out on several occasions that it does not possess the mandate it needs to apply these funds in the region in question, and the cost of borrowing would be too high in the absence of co-funding from the Commission. To requests for such co-funding, then, I ask the House not to turn a deaf ear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If genuine integration is to take place in the EU, and not only political integration, but also practical and logistical integration, then funding must be provided for the Trans-European Networks. If the European economy is to develop, then the European Investment Bank must step up its support for the SME sector, for the social economy sector and for what are known as local services, as this is particularly important from a demographic point of view. It is absolutely crucial for there to be a level playing field when it comes to granting loans. Certain Member States receive a relatively small volume of loans and their SME sector should receive more. To this end, the European Investment Bank must improve its administrative procedures and increase access for local funding partners and SMEs. It is essential that all EU-related institutions, in particular financial institutions, be transparent. Unfortunately, however, it has come to our notice that there are conflicts of interest between those at the helm of the EIB. I refer you to paragraph 21 of the motion for a resolution, for example. This is extremely bad news. Conflicts of this kind must not be allowed to continue, as they convey a negative image of the EIB. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maystadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Investment Bank. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, may I first of all thank you for continuing the tradition that began in the previous legislative period. As Mr Lipietz mentioned just now, it is only five years since the European Investment Bank was invited to engage in dialogue with the European Parliament. For my part, I am delighted about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European Investment Bank is not formally an institution of the European Union. Its shareholders are the Member States and we are answerable to our shareholders, that is to say the national governments and parliaments; on the other hand, however, the European Investment Bank was created by the Treaty and, as we have mentioned, its task is to support the European Union’s political objectives financially. I think it is therefore only right that the bank should be asked to give account of itself before the elected representatives of Europe’s citizens and I can confirm, as Mr Lipietz said at the beginning, that this is a productive dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Indisputably, Parliament is now able to take a more positive view of the EIB in a number of areas, because several recommendations made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and adopted by this House have been implemented and progress has been made as a result, especially in the matters of governance, transparency and the quality of supervision. Last week I took part in the annual meeting of presidents of multilateral development banks and I was pleased to find that in several respects the EIB now serves as a model for other international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a productive dialogue. I think it should be continued with different committees. I will not enlarge any further on the questions of governance and transparency that I have just mentioned. I will simply say to Mrs Wortmann-Kool that we remain open on the question of prudential supervision. There is a very simple reason why no other international financial body is subject to this kind of supervision: the main purpose of prudential supervision is to protect depositors. International financial institutions have no depositors, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we remain open. Parliament suggested that the European Central Bank might supervise the EIB. The Member States did not want to give the ECB such powers. In any case, I can tell you that we have decided to apply the new Basel II rules on a voluntary basis. If one day we do come under supervision, we will therefore be in a position to show the competent authority that we have applied the relevant rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about our activities in the European Union. I have noted the particular stress several Members of this House placed on our contribution to the Lisbon strategy. In Lisbon, the European Council in fact asked the EIB to make a contribution to funding in a number of areas that were considered absolute priorities for that strategy. You know how essential a part increasing investment in research and education clearly plays in the Lisbon strategy. After Lisbon, we therefore launched a programme that we call ‘i2i’: the Innovation 2010 Initiative. We have already agreed loans amounting to 24 billion euros for this programme. To be more precise: 7 billion for training, 10 billion for research and development and 7 billion for the diffusion of new technologies. We fully intend to continue along that road and, as Mr Lipietz said, make a contribution that goes beyond words and declarations of principle, one that extends to funding some very specific projects, while at the same time trying, as Mrs van den Burg stressed, to deploy new financial instruments. As part of this i2i programme, we have already adopted new types of loan, with risk sharing. In cooperation with the Commission, we are now working on formulae that would allow us to go even further down that route, to take more risks, since these are areas which, by their very nature, require the funding provider to agree to assume part of the risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted the stress some of you place on small and medium-sized businesses. I can see that my time is running out, so I will respond very briefly. I can confirm that, so far as global loans are concerned – a subject which has already been discussed in committee – we are renegotiating the contracts with the intermediary banks to ensure that they really do pass on to the final beneficiary the financial advantage we are giving them. I also note the emphasis on microcredit. I note the concerns about the environment and I can assure you that the report we present to the Board of Directors on all the projects we are asked to finance includes a section – sometimes a very detailed section if the project requires this – on the environmental impact of the project we are being asked to finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about our activities outside the European Union. These must in fact be placed in the context of the European Union’s new approach to external policy. As Mrs Zimmer briefly mentioned, the aim is to combine the resources of the Commission, the Member States and the European Investment Bank better in order to make our development assistance more effective and involve us more directly in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Seppänen I will simply say that we agree entirely with his suggestion concerning the guarantee fund. As to the rebalancing and the chart, that is not for us to decide, but the Council, which gives us mandates concerning different regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please forgive me for having gone over my allotted time; I would simply like to conclude by restating our desire to continue this dialogue with Parliament. We are in dialogue with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and we have just begun to engage in dialogue with the Committee on Development. We are at the disposal of Parliament’s different committees to examine these issues in greater depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted, in any case, to reiterate, for the sake of clarity, that what I said related specifically to Article 21 of this report, which expresses precisely these concerns. If, then, representatives of the two main parties in this House – forming a sort of Great Coalition – tell us that everything is all right, it must consequently be all right for someone who does not belong to that Great Coalition to say that things are not all right, and that brings me to my second point.</p>
<p class="contents">An honourable Member made reference to my absence from the vote on this report. This has to do with the fact that I sit on three committees, the meetings of which clash with regrettable frequency, and I can hardly be in three places at one and the same time. On a point of information, and for the sake of what is termed objectivity, let me point out that Ewald Nowotny – to whom the honourable gentleman referred – was one of the main sources of information for this critical report, so it is an unfortunate fact that we will have to carry on grappling with all these problems if we are to achieve the clarity and transparency that we do not as yet have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
