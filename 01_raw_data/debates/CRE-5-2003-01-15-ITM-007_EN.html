<p class="contents">In reality, what we have here is a struggle between two concepts of immigration policy: the States meeting in the Council are trying to push through a (relatively) restrictive concept, whereas the Commission is constantly putting much more open proposals on the table, which might be said to be based on the idea that the rights of immigrants and refugees take precedence over the right of the citizens of the countries of Europe to security.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is clearly showing here whose side it is on. Moreover, it is explicitly calling for the speedy adoption of the Commission’s lax proposals on allowing immigrants’ families to join them and the rights of long term resident immigrants, even going so far as to say that those rights must be ‘as close as possible to those of European citizens’.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Treaty of Nice (which the governments of the States wanted) provides that these questions will soon be settled by qualified majority in the Council: that will be another factor in the Commission’s favour, to get its proposals adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So many of these creatures have asked me to ensure – in my own small way with my vote – that these experiments, which they do not look on kindly, are ended. They also asked me to try my best to stop fur coats being made from their pelts: another important achievement which I hope will come about soon.

I welcome the fact that, in the conciliation process, both the Council and the Commission moved towards the position maintained by the European Parliament.

In Italy, we still have a law which does not grant a disability pension to elderly citizens, whereas it does grant it to its younger citizens.

I take the view that one can have the most divergent views on all issues of policy, but I regard a polarisation of this sort on human rights as being intrinsically malignant. We should be consistent in concerning ourselves with real violations of human rights and real discrimination, and doing so consensually and on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rather than letting this House be divided into two equal and mutually antagonistic ideological camps. In my view, the cause of human rights is too important for a community founded on law and human rights to allow that to be done to it. That is why I voted against this report. Not everything that has human rights on the cover is actually about human rights, and if we want to lay down how the monks on Mount Athos organise access to their monasteries, regulate religious communities, and force Member States to accept certain definitions of marriage and the family that many of us – myself included – fundamentally repudiate, then that has nothing to do with human rights, but rather with ideology, and it is ideology that has not been neglected in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us consider one of many: the institution of the family, which is, to say the least, distorted by this report; a family model which proposes the free union between men or women of the same sex and liberalised single-parent or, precisely, homosexual, adoption laws. And furthermore, a country is put forward as a model – the Netherlands to be exact – which, in addition to these things, has official euthanasia and liberalised drug policies.</p>

Reading the pages of the Swiebel Report, however, it can be inferred that this important commitment to everybody’s rights is being transformed into an accusation against some quarters: in particular Italy and those who, in Italy, took the liberty of voting against the rapporteur’s wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Also with regard to defence of the family and related values, the report takes a one-sided, prejudiced view, which is certainly legitimate for a political group, but which cannot and must not become a common position of the European Union. Apart from religious aspects – which, nevertheless, cannot be completely overlooked, given the importance attached to Christian culture in Europe – the report completely ignores the great social and educational value undeniably inherent in the traditional couple, intended as a basic cell in the connective tissue of society. Defence of the right of individuals to conduct their relationships in their preferred manner is sacrosanct, but the European institutions cannot, in my view, equate these relationships with the social institution of the family in its traditional meaning.</p>

<p class="contents">It contains an anthology of aberrations: from the recognition of the right to vote and eligibility of foreigners, to the application of quotas for foreigners’ access to the job market, to the extension of homosexual marriage, to the abolition of the current minimum age for marriage in France – which is currently 15 for girls and 18 for boys – or the extension of the interpretation of the concept of national minority to all ethnic minorities.</p>

It is to Mrs Swiebel’s credit that she has documented so well how much is wrong in Europe in the area of human rights. She correctly focuses attention on police misconduct, abuses in prisons, discrimination against ethnic minorities, failings in criminal proceedings and the vestiges of inequalities between men and women. This also applies to child labour, the access of non-EU citizens to the labour market, the difficulties people have in obtaining the nationality of the country in which they are now living, and the lack of the right to vote for those who have not yet obtained this nationality. EU Member States are apparently failing to ratify international treaties on national minorities, cross-border television, the revised European Social Charter and the status of adopted or illegitimate children. Minors are being used as child soldiers. Excessively authoritarian security measures that are now being justified with reference to the current threat of terrorism are threatening to become permanent. We are very much in need of this inventory so that we can put an end to abuses more effectively. It is striking that this report, which speaks for itself, was only adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs by 25 votes to 20. Evidently there is a large minority in this Parliament that does not want to tackle the existing violations of fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the democratic point of view, I congratulate Mrs Swiebel on her ultimate success. The narrow margin between votes, however, which meant that my own motion for a resolution was not adopted in plenary (by only 23 votes) and the extremely slim majority (of only five votes) that has just adopted the final resolution, clearly show that the wrong course has been taken. This adds nothing positive to European integration on which, being an issue so bound up in the tradition, history and consensus of the European peoples, we have been so profoundly divided, heading towards radical confrontations. In fact, anyone reading the motion that has been adopted might believe themselves to be living in a terrible atmosphere of persecution, under one of the murkiest dictatorships of the twentieth century! The methodological shift employed by the rapporteur (and by the narrow majority) has led to exaggerated views that show utter contempt for the fact that the European Union is one of the few privileged regions in the entire world where human rights and respect and guarantees for these are concerned. Lastly, we have heaped scorn on the reality of a situation with which we are all familiar and we have ended up looking ridiculous, for having given in to a left-wing and sectarian political agenda. This does no favours, either for Europe or for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the initiative of tabling an overall alternative motion: since the UEN Group has only 22 Members, the 246 votes obtained in plenary by the alternative motion clearly demonstrate the relative success achieved, as an instrument for political clarification and for affirming our difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is probably the first time in the history of the European Parliament that a rapporteur has presented a report on human rights which, for good reasons, has been so fiercely criticised and has attracted such a strikingly narrow majority of votes (274 in favour, 269 against and 14 abstentions).</p>
<p class="contents">The report reflects options selected on a party political basis and misuses the concept of human rights. This is due to the fact that the rapporteur (by discussing, for example, family legislation and the rights of Greek monks in relation to their properties in Mount Athos) ranges far and wide beyond the original remit and parameters of the report, which are constituted by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. In this way, the concept of human rights is diluted, watered down and devalued, which is pretty serious.</p>
<p class="contents">I have grave doubts as to how secure a basis there is for the far-reaching assertion in item133 to the effect that in seven EU Member States, including Sweden, a ‘climate of impunity’ prevails in relation to misconduct and violence by police and prison staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the issue in question is not an EU matter, we European and Christian Democrats were, however, successful in removing item83 (279 votes in favour, 259 against and 9 abstentions), with its invitation to the Member States ‘to open up marriage to same-sex couples’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, though, is only the first step in the right direction, and I would like to make it abundantly clear that I am putting the case for our pressing for a truly European border protection force, for a European Corps of Border Guards with a basis in Community law and financed on a Community basis, for anything else would be nothing more than a hotchpotch. As far as the proposed educational institution is concerned, I suggest that resources should be combined and duplication of work avoided by using the Police Academy, also proposed in the 1998 report and already up and running.

<p class="contents">The Seville Council decided to create yet another repressive supranational mechanism, the European Corps of Border Guards. However, the immediate creation of such a corps clashes with the Member States’ constitutions, which is why the Commission has decided on a hybrid solution which it refers to as ‘common services to control external borders’.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been decided to incorporate the Common Manual for External Borders – yet another purely police manual – into Community legislation, once it has been revised and made even more anti-democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are even plans to use satellites and radar to monitor the EU's borders, by making use of the Galileo satellite navigation system, while yet another service has been added to the repertoire of monitoring and policing services, the SCIFA+, which will operate as a steering body responsible for coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worrying is that the report adopted by the European Parliament is even more autocratic than the Commission communication. The report equates illegal immigration, which it quotes as an example of a current threat, with organised crime, accepts the propaganda about ‘new risk scenarios’, criticises the delay in setting up the Border Guard etc.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are, however, doubtful about the idea of an EU-financed Corps of Border Guards. The national police forces’ monopoly on crime fighting and border patrols within the territories of the Member States is fundamental and should be retained. Police from other countries should not have the power to act in other Member States except under very special circumstances, as is also stated in the Schengen Convention. As far as possible, these rules should also apply to border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual Member States’ provisions and traditions when it comes to police work, especially procedures relating to ID checks and arrests, differ from one another in many respects. With a joint Corps of Border Guards, there might be a danger of these provisions’ not being fully respected.

As well as the common market, we have the great Schengen agreement. We can move freely.

<p class="contents">This doorman at the external borders, however, is not doing his job. In Almeria, Brindisi and, as of June 2004, in Poland, Cyprus and the Baltic States, drugs, pimps, immigration, human trafficking, criminals and terrorists all move freely. Security is no longer guaranteed. The rapporteur asks for radars, satellites, a common monitoring policy, continuous training with a type of ‘Frontalis’, following the ‘Fiscalis’ model of integrated tax control, and naturally the inevitable European body.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, a border-control corps, just as others want coastguards. There is even the traditional European agency to heal all woes going by the name of SCIFA+, a body responsible for coordinating border protection. In the meantime, the external borders are like leaky sieves, letting everything through. Which at the end of the day is the only effective solution. Once Europe has been swamped from the East and from the South, it will no longer be necessary to monitor entry through the borders since everyone will already be inside.</p>

If the EU develops into one single superstate, it goes without saying that there must be one single minister of foreign affairs with one single embassy in every country abroad and one single collective seat in the United Nations. The remarkable thing is that nobody is openly advocating a superstate such as this. The Member States want to keep their embassies and their seats in the UN and the ministers of foreign affairs would rather coordinate their work through a common secretariat than through the European Commission. Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence, we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states. It would therefore only be logical to opt for a standard access procedure for migrants and visitors from abroad and a standard border surveillance service if we really wanted to be one single superstate. What is remarkable is that we are now making a decision to screen off ‘Fortress Europe’ against the poor parts of the outside world without having reached agreement about a common future inside this fortress.

Nevertheless, it is clear that in the Schengen acquis, structures with competences and powers to define ‘common standards’ and processes for police cooperation are already in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, however, goes further and the aim behind it is to create a European Corps of Border Guards, with duties that fall within the strict competence of the national authorities and to which, therefore, we cannot agree. Its activities would involve, in particular, the inspection of documents, the questioning of foreign citizens and the notification of admission or refusal of entry into our territory. Clearly, a European police corps of this nature raises questions, primarily with regard to its questionable and highly dubious effectiveness. Essentially, however, and as affirmed in the Commission Communication, it would pose delicate constitutional problems in various Member States. It is therefore a priority to make national police forces with these powers more effective and to ensure appropriate cooperation between them in order to provide a satisfactory response to such situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the importance of the Commission communication which, in discussing the better management of the EU’s external borders, links the action of the Member States to measures of a European nature, which are actually crucial, given the threats posed in particular by organised crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, as well as the imminent entry into the EU of new countries. Secondly, the positive approach of the rapporteur, who continually emphasises that the management of our borders is still a national competence and must be applied at the national level. This must not, however, in light of the experience gained from applying the Schengen acquis, prevent the development of a coordinated policy for the management of current and future external borders, incorporating into this policy the best practices established by the Member States. For this reason I too support the proposal to adopt, at Community level, programmes for the training, including re-training, of staff and senior officials and the drawing up of an integrated risk analysis model. I am also in favour of creating a European corps of border guards, composed of special units and to be made available on a temporary basis to the national authorities in high-risk sectors at external borders, when needed and requested by the Member States. I would, as a matter of fact, draw attention to the fact that Portugal has precisely one of the most important and sensitive external borders of the EU – in this case, a maritime border – to which no one has paid particular attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The specific needs of the elderly regarding health care need much more attention, especially in rural areas. In my own country, projections are that more and more elderly people are moving to rural areas to retire. They put down roots in such communities. Long, active and fulfilled lives depend more on socialising than exercising, and it is important that as many as possible of the needs of the elderly are addressed within their local communities rather than addressed at a distance in the towns and cities.</p>

Bearing in mind the need to respond to the problem of ageing in a way that ensures not only economic growth but also financial sustainability, and in line with the strategy adopted by the Gothenburg Council of June 2001, the Member States’ targets must be to achieve increased rates of employment, to reduce public debt in order to compensate for increased spending on pensions and healthcare and to reform pension schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This population now includes the third, and in particular, the fourth age, those over the age of 85, with loss of autonomy, motor and cerebral handicaps and extreme ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as the resolution notes that mental illness in the elderly primarily affects women, they have gone from mastering sterility in the 1980s to senile dementia between 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this clinical, budgetary, economic and social situation, the rapporteur asks the right questions and then gets bogged down in a mire of vague solutions. The questions are financial. Where will we find the finances, a sum that varies between 4 and 8% of GDP, for the constant care and medical interventions needed by millions of Europeans who have lost their autonomy? The questions are also professional. Where are the specialists in geriatrics, the carers, the specialist care centres, the training required for this segment of the population?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to these challenges lies in the new economy of ageing, in inventing a new human planning sector with new diplomas for geriatric assistants and new branches of medicine and associated professions.</p>

Without the input of community money, people who are old, sick or unemployed will not be able to exist. We would have no decent healthcare for the vast majority of people, no education, no public transport, no environmental protection and no services for the aged. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants a combination of best practices, access, high quality and accessibility. It makes little sense to formulate such nice objectives without providing sufficient resources to enable these objectives to actually be achieved. By constantly striving to cut taxes, we make it impossible to provide good services and the solidarity required for these. People constantly maintain that the cost of services can be cut without compromising on quality. That would have to be achieved by calling in private profit-oriented businesses, by reducing the number of services, by having the work done by fewer people and by increasing contributions from users. In the Netherlands, years of cut-backs have resulted in the closure of small hospitals, waiting lists for healthcare, a shortage of new teachers and a severe reduction in services in what used to be a good public transport system.

This does not mean, however, that the ongoing need to protect those who are particularly vulnerable or who have serious financial difficulties due to the high cost of treatment should be overlooked. Against this backdrop, the proposals contained in the Commission Communication are of strategic importance to guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability with regard to healthcare for the elderly. The fact that the organisation of healthcare systems, their funding and planning are the responsibility of the Member States is not a barrier to Community cooperation in policies on issues of ageing, in particular in the field of health. Instead, the sharing of experiences and solutions could help to achieve the social cohesion that we wish to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I have fully supported this report, which has, in fact, incorporated valuable contributions from the opinion delivered by Mr Mussa of the UEN Group, not least with regard to: recognising the important role of healthcare providers, the proposal for Community funding for various training projects and the issue of ill treatment of the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should emphasise the need for a ‘New Attitude’ with respect to the elderly, seeing them as an important new resource that should be cherished – not as a burden on society. Life expectancy has almost doubled in the last fifty years, which has created a completely different world. Through better levels of protection, Europe and the Europeans will benefit enormously from the huge wealth of wisdom, experience and knowledge that is the valuable capital of the elderly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We support the resolution but wish to point out that it makes no mention of women or their human rights. Nor does it mention women’s priorities, supported by Parliament in December 2001, but, rather, those of the Afghan Government. We believe there needs to be a requirement for all aid projects to be informed by the dimension of equality and for women to be represented in the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Women were victims under both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy for Afghanistan must be a policy also aimed at the majority of the Afghan people, namely women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation for women is no better than before, children have just as little access to education as in the past, not to mention the tremendous poverty of most of the inhabitants of this country, which is still aggravated by the death and destruction sown by Western planes.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, with the support of European Member States, has spent vast sums on flooding the country with bombs. There is no question, however, of the world powers spending even a fraction of these sums on improving the life of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The various resolutions themselves reflect a rose-tinted view of the disastrous situation in Afghanistan. As always, however, we are content to welcome, request and invite. We did not join in with this ineffective whimpering, when, a year ago, most of the Members making these noises today supported the brutal policy of the world powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
