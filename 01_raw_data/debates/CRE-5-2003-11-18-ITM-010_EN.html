<p class="contents">Our proposal aims to ensure consistency in dealing with shipments of waste. We need to ensure environmentally sound management in relation to both shipments within the Community and exports from the Community to third countries. It is focused on implementing the 2001 OECD decision, pursuing international harmonisation, which means respecting the internationally agreed obligations in the Basel Convention, addressing problems encountered in the application of the regulation since its adoption ten years ago and enhancing the structure of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to shipments within the Community, I share the concerns expressed about standard dumping in waste for recovery. The Commission proposal and the Communication on a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste clearly recognise the problem. However, our response is a long-term solution at EU level, whose main elements are, firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPPC Directive and, secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham or fake recovery and clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to exports from the Community to third countries, I support the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment to further sharpen the regulation by making reference to both EU legislation and certain internationally-agreed guidelines, in particular those on ship recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude this introduction by saying that it is important that we do not allow environmental standard dumping, either when we ship waste internally within the Community or when we export it from the Community to third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is the existence of differing market conditions. Not all Member States have bans or taxes on the dumping of waste. As a result, a great deal of waste is being transferred to other countries. This runs counter to the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency that apply to waste disposal under the Waste Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Shipments of waste can only be refused if the waste cannot be recovered in the importing country. A lengthy debate has arisen on the subject of when something can be considered to be recovery. The problem in this whole debate is that waste recovery is not necessarily more sound in environmental terms. Clear criteria for recovery must therefore be developed. The European Commission acknowledges this problem by remarking, among other things, that there are few Community environmental requirements for waste recovery operations. There is no prospect of a solution to this problem, however, unless the Commission makes proposals as part of the Thematic Strategy on Recycling. It is currently the Court of Justice that determines what constitutes waste recovery, and this is unacceptable. In addition, the amendment of the Waste Framework Directive has been far too long in coming.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not behaving responsibly towards the waste sector if we await the whole, protracted, process of amending the Waste Framework Directive. Clarity is needed in the shorter term. Since the problems arise primarily in connection with the shipment of waste, it is an obvious course of action to spell out these additional conditions in this Regulation. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that, until the European Commission formulates these conditions, the Member States should have the option of imposing their own conditions on waste recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is my view that it must be possible to refuse shipments of waste if a minimum percentage of recovery and a minimum calorific value are not observed. A misunderstanding persists as to these grounds for refusal. If there is the possibility of refusing a shipment of waste on environmental grounds, this does not imply that refusal is compulsory. Some position papers incorrectly state that shipments of waste are banned. Articles 12 and 13 of this Regulation are not talking about a ban, but about the fact that shipments of waste may be undertaken by mutual agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The reuse of silver, even if it is less than one tenth of a per cent, shall thus remain possible. Exports of waste should only be permitted if they lead to recovery or final disposal in the short term; and not, therefore, exports of waste that are destined for what is termed ‘interim recovery’ or ‘interim disposal’, as far as the Committee on the Environment is concerned. In practice, a great deal goes wrong during the mixing, sorting and storing involved. It can no longer be ascertained where the waste has gone and what has happened to it. Waste that is well sorted and quantifiable, and is really recovered or disposed of in an environmentally sound way, can indeed be exported, therefore. In line with this, the Committee on the Environment proposes a ban on the export of unsorted household waste. After all, we do not transport our sewage to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the implementation of this Regulation. We must not give in to those Member States that are failing to invest sufficiently in this. For this reason, I do not support Amendments 95 and 98 by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which introduce implied permission for the country of import. Prior mutual written agreement is necessary for the purposes of transparency. There are Member States that do not have their house in order at the moment. They themselves admit that they cannot control shipments of waste. In this regard, the Member States concerned must bring about change instead of complaining about the administrative burden.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, price competition on the European waste market is acceptable, but eco-competition is not. What the Committee on the Environment does not want is exports of waste that lead to an environmentally less sound alternative. After all, this Regulation is not intended to facilitate trade in waste, but to enable environmentally sound waste management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this great work, although I do not agree with some of his points of view, because many of the amendments he has presented are aimed at restricting the free movement of waste. And waste, whether we like it or not, represents goods and must be treated as such, even if we regulate the aspects which may affect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The transport of waste in itself is not an environmental problem. The problem is rather the management of this waste, but this is an issue which does not fall within the scope of the present regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment has approved the removal of Article 133 as the legal basis for the proposal, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in favour of this change of legal basis. However, the PPE-DE Group is opposed to the removal of the legal basis relating to commercial policy. I would like therefore to expressly ask the Commissioner to give a clear opinion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important to establish clear rules for the transport of waste by ship and, in this regard, Mr Blokland has presented Amendment 92, which we support, because it resolves the problem of ships which are exported in order to be scrapped. However, Amendments 37 and 44 eliminate the principle of Community self-sufficiency established in the framework directive on waste and establish a single principle of national self-sufficiency. We are not going to support them because they are contrary to the provisions of the framework directive on waste itself.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments which prohibit provisional recycling operations, we believe that they make no sense, particularly in cross-border regions within the European Union. We take an identical view of the amendments which establish criteria to define what must be considered recycling. The definition of these parameters is not the subject of this regulation and, if any of the amendments in this regard are approved, the PPE-DE Group will vote against the report.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission, however, to modify the annexes to the framework directive on waste in order to make it clear, once and for all, what recycling is, since we cannot continue to hide behind the judgment of the Court of Justice in accordance with which the Commission interprets its own Directives. Judgments are not law, they are specific cases and, for the moment, all they are doing is contributing to a situation in which the agents involved in the management of waste are carrying out their activities in conditions of legal uncertainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recently had the problem of ships sailing from the United States to the UK for dismantling and recovery and when some of them arrived, it was discovered, as we had pointed out here in the European Parliament, that there were no facilities in the UK to do the work under European Union law. They are now lying there during the winter, to be returned to the United States, creating a further risk to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposals in this report to tighten the definition of waste recovery, to encourage Member States to solve the household waste issue self-sufficiently. I would draw attention to the fact that we in the Republic of Ireland have introduced a 15 cent surcharge on supermarket plastic bags, which has been enormously successful in dramatically reducing the number of plastic bags being issued by supermarkets. This has had a significant impact on the amount of waste. We still have a huge waste problem in Ireland. There is huge resistance to incineration because of health fears, unreasonable in my view, but the fears are there. We have to concentrate on reduction and I hope that this new proposal will help to take us in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After 28 years, environmental dumping is still a major problem. One reason for this is that environmental standards are not the same everywhere, the main reason for this being that there is great disagreement over what recovery actually entails. There is a lack of clear criteria. The European Commission has blundered here. It should have taken the initiative in providing clarity many years ago. Sadly, however, the Commission gave in to pressure from the waste industry, which prefers to continue to dump waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg has now made a couple of rulings in this legal void, but these do not provide a definite answer either to the question as to what exactly constitutes recovery and what does not. Incinerating everything is not recovery, in the opinion of my group. Sadly, that is now the case – by definition. Recovery implies a usefulness that is not present in the incineration of newspapers; recycling paper is much more useful. Obviously, once paper has been recycled five to seven times it can no longer be recycled, and then incineration could indeed be useful. Even the incineration of sewage sludge is deemed useful – by definition. It is highly doubtful whether that is advisable, however. If the sludge has leaked out, that would perhaps be useful, but definitely not if it is soaked in water.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now hold this political debate. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has done so. Tomorrow we shall also be voting on amendments. Since the Commission has not provided any clarity, we shall have to do it. It makes no sense to wait for a thematic strategy before thinking of introducing further legislation. We would then be five years down the line. We should try to fill this gap now – for better or worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It deals with different levels of control, depending on the risks posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the proposal, shipments of all waste destined for disposal and shipments of hazardous and semi-hazardous waste destined for recovery will be subject to the requirement of prior written notification and consent.</p>
<p class="contents">The tacit consent allowed under the current regulation will be abolished. Non-hazardous or what is termed 'green list waste for recovery' would remain subject neither to notification nor consent. In other words, the present requirements would remain for green listed waste.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that a greater administrative burden will fall on waste companies exporting waste across EU borders and on competent authorities of dispatch. The Commission claims that there should be no major economic cost. I would like the Commission to tell me specifically whether or not an economic impact analysis was done in relation to this particular proposal, to back-up their claim in relation to the economic costs involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the harmonisation and tightening up of procedures is generally very welcome from an environmental protection perspective. It is also proposed to clarify the amount and extent of the coverage of the financial guarantee or insurance to be approved by the competent authority of dispatch; all competent authorities are to have access to it and it must also cover possible storage charges. The latter is particularly welcome. The amount of guarantee or insurance is currently the subject of some debate. Perhaps the Commission could comment on that. It has been generally agreed that a consistent method for calculating this should be developed. The Commission has presented a draft outline on how this might be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is a small island nation, effectively without any recovery or incineration facilities. We will be dependent on the orderly shipment of waste for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly welcome this proposal, but no matter how well-regulated the system is, there will always be risks, culminating in accidents such as the one in April this year, when a German-registered ship, the <span class="italic">Mulheim</span>, ran aground on the tip of Cornwall. It was carrying 2 200 tonnes of shredded car waste from Cork in the south-west of Ireland to Lübeck in Germany. Mrs Jackson gave me a plastic bag of this waste, recovered by the environmental NGOs when they were cleaning up the beach in Cornwall. That is one of the risks that will always be with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The particular issue I would like to focus on is recovery. A number of people have referred to the European Court judgment. It is long overdue for the Commission to clarify exactly what 'recovery' is, because it is an issue that crosses into the packaging directives and a number of other EU directives as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not take a genius to work out that recovery does not mean incinerating waste. This is an appalling waste of resources. We should not allow Member States to move in that direction, particularly those that do not have incineration at the moment. I am speaking in particular about my own Member State, which would like to have the opportunity to build incinerators.</p>
<p class="contents">When one considers the lobbying regarding the Blokland report, a lot of it is from people who operate incinerators and want to ensure that they remain economically viable. It is quite clear that if incineration is allowed to be classified as recovery, then there is an incentive to burn and dispose in this way and that creates a disincentive for governments to get their act together.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very bad example to set to other Member States joining the European Union. In my own country in particular, the Irish Government looks for derogations right, left and centre, despite the fact that it has made no effort whatsoever to provide the public in Ireland with the possibility to have effective recycling possibilities or to create recycling industries. We are throwing away a large amount of jobs by allowing the waste to be burned. This is not an economical way of dealing with waste in the long-term nor it is good for the environment or public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Waste management and promoting the recycling and recovery of waste can have a direct impact on people’s everyday lives and welfare, as well as their enjoyment of their surroundings.</p>
<p class="contents">The explosive growth in the volume of waste in the future will be both an environmental and a health problem for an enlarged European Union and its citizens. Nevertheless, in many Member States regulations for waste management, the prevention of its build-up, recovery and recycling have not been implemented yet in any serious way, and national laws are often unsatisfactory. I myself belong to a band of happy citizens who live in a country where the national strategy on waste is sufficiently ambitious and dealt with excellently. Finland’s waste problems at national level cannot, however, be shrugged off, because, as with environmental disasters, waste knows no limits either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal to clarify regulations on shipments of waste and clinch a deal on common rules for the waste markets is sorely needed. The authorities need clear legislation to improve waste recovery and steer waste management in a more environmentally friendly direction than before. It is also particularly important that the minimum requirements for environmental standards applied to third countries adhere to the internal legislative logic of the Community and are not based on any merely vague guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also worried about the welfare of vulnerable sea areas and the environmental risks they face. The protection of Europe’s only internal sea, the Baltic, has long been a priority for the Finnish state. I regard it as important that the proposal in question should include the EU’s regional waters, which need protection from the threats posed by waste traffic. It is important to note that ships and other means of transport by water can be classed as waste. The Basel Convention has not taken separate account of this, and it is therefore important to raise the matter here and now so that any loopholes can be closed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 26 amendments fully and a further 23 amendments in principle or in part. Certain amendments to Article 13 on objections to waste for recovery pursue national solutions rather than solutions at Community level, and these amendments are particularly aimed at addressing the issues of so-called standard dumping in relation to waste destined for recovery by allowing a number of further justifications for objecting to shipments destined for recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the problem relates to the fact that waste for recovery travels almost freely within the single market and, at the same time, waste treatment that respects higher standards is often more costly than conventional waste treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that we can allow competition on costs but not on environmental standards. However, we are legally obliged through the Treaty to safeguard the environment while also respecting the rules of the internal market. A solution can therefore be best found at Community level and should be based on three main elements. Firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPC Directive; secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham recovery and thirdly, clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say that it is not easy to see a solution until this long-term solution is found or established, but we in the Commission definitely recognise the problem and the need to discuss a possible solution in the meantime, and this will be part of the process from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue of concern to the Commission is the proposed banning of the interim treatment operations. Amendments 13, 14, 34 and 41 propose banning shipments of waste for interim treatment operations and define recovery and disposal operations as only covering final treatment and not interim operations. The Commission believes that an outright ban would both lack environmental justification and would conflict with the Treaty. Further, the Commission believes that it is essential that the horizontal definitions of recovery and disposal operations as established in the Waste Framework Directive are adhered to within this regulation. Establishing different definitions would be both inconsistent and unnecessarily complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue of consistency with existing legislation also arises in other amendments. Certain amendments to Article 13 aim to establish criteria to classify a treatment as recovery and address the issue of sham recovery. In fact, such criteria could be among several deemed relevant for the distinction between recovery and disposal in general, which is a horizontal issue which should be settled in the context of the Waste Framework Directive rather than in the specific context of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the Commission might not entirely disagree with the substance of the proposed clarifications, there is a strong argument for consistency in the lists in the annexes and if changes are required they should, as a first step, be introduced at their point of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element regarding Annex V, namely that of giving priority to the EU hazardous list above the Basel non-hazardous list in relation to the so-called Basel ban on exports of hazardous waste from OECD to non-OECD countries, can be supported – Amendments 69 and 70.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make a brief comment on the question of the double legal basis. As the explanatory memorandum establishes, the primary objective of the regulation is protection of the environment. That main objective has been maintained in the new proposal and the legal basis is in Article 175 of the EC Treaty: environment. However, as regards the provisions of Titles IV, V and VI on exports out of, imports into and transit through the Community to and from third countries, it can be argued that these are rules which pursue an overall and general environmental objective, as well as rules on international trade. Environmental rules, therefore, also apply to the trade regime and are linked to it. Therefore, the legal basis as regards the specific provisions in these three titles is Article 133 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 95 proposes to allow tacit consent in relation to shipments of hazardous waste for recovery. As is also stressed in the explanatory memorandum, this is not acceptable to the Commission. Firstly, we have to apply the precautionary approach to shipments of hazardous waste within the Community and, secondly, we have to respect the Basel Convention's requirements in this respect. The Basel Convention is very clear and leaves no room for interpretation. Written consent for shipments of hazardous waste must be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the amendments which pursue the same goal as the Commission proposal, namely the promotion of EU standards and certain internationally-agreed guidelines in the country of destination outside the Community. The guidelines added to the list – the ILO guidelines on ship-breaking and the OECD guidelines on personal computers – can also be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to impact assessment, there is none. However, the system of notification and information is a well-established one. There is no specific impact assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
