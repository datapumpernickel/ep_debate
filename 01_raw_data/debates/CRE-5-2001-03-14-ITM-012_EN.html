<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fava (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, it goes without saying that we associate ourselves with the guiding spirit behind the Commission’s communication on election assistance and observation, namely the principle that encouraging genuine democracies is not only an ethical imperative but also a condition of sustainable development and lasting peace, a specific mandate of the Union in application of the Treaties, and the foundation of our foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that it is also something else: it is a commitment that is not formal, but is difficult, which cannot be relegated just to declarations of principle but which must be built through consistent, practical political acts. That is therefore the role of the European Union and the European Parliament in election assistance and observation, given that free elections are a necessary precondition for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Two 1999 Council Regulations represent the legal basis for transforming our role into a substantial commitment. In what way? A consistent political strategy is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, we have chalked up eight years of totally generous election assistance and observation, often with excellent results: I refer to Zimbabwe and Russia. However, it has been a matter of occasional interventions, so we are very much in favour of the Commission’s communication, which provides us with a coherent political strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another necessary step is to extend that strategy to every stage of the intervention in the observation which precedes and accompanies the elections, because the democratic process is not exhausted on polling day. It involves establishing the proper connections between electoral support and development aid policies, a structured relationship with the international organisations, the NGOs and civil society, not using the mechanisms of the delegation, which we have often settled for, but rather the mechanisms of genuine political cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report has sought to make contributions in a number of areas, first and foremost on the role of Parliament. Under no circumstances – especially not in this specific case – can Parliament be regarded as a mere notary, called upon to ratify an electoral process or the quality of an electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Our legitimacy and our function are political in nature and our presence in the Union’s observation missions – our proper political role – can represent added value for the European Union. So it is useful for the European Parliament to be present at every stage, including the stages preceding election observation in the strict sense, and it is desirable – where the right conditions exist – to have the European Union mission led by a Member of Parliament. What is more, our record is excellent: our former colleague, Mr Schori, led the mission in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, political role and visibility are being won in the field, and I see them as a resource not only for Parliament but for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental point is the need for institutional coordination between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We advocate a permanent consultation mechanism, regarding this as preferable to an interinstitutional agreement which would be more cumbersome and require very demanding inputs of time and management and implementation methods. Taking up the suggestions of certain Members, we advocate a half-yearly timetable allowing constant monitoring of what is happening, given the very violent accelerations political history records these days.</p>
<p class="contents">We advocate the creation of an adequately staffed election department within the Commission, and one of our amendments calls specifically for numbers equal to the task facing the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, a greater and different kind of flexibility in the European Union’s commitment criteria is needed. First, elections and regional elections may not be sufficient parameters for recognising when it is appropriate to intervene. We are participating in the election observation in Peru and that is certainly not the first election. Flexibility is definitely needed in the evaluation standards. The two words ‘free and fair’ do not cover everything Parliament and the European Union should focus on in their election observation activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not rigidity; it is rigour, and a necessary rigour, because what has primarily been lacking over the last few years has been rigour in choices and approaches. Moreover, strategy consists of rules and objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we feel – as does the Commission – that democracy is a process, not a choice made on a single day. We know that genuine democracy in many countries starts to be built on polling day and goes on from there. We want to continue to make our resources available, and not just economic resources but the resources of our democratic heritage and our political commitment as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Throughout our negotiations on this issue we have had very good cooperation. He has always understood the importance of a strong development perspective since half of all the EU observer missions have been in developing countries. And the European Union, as a multinational organisation of fifteen developed democracies, clearly has a duty as well as a significant role to play in all the global efforts to promote democratisation, sustainable development and peaceful progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to welcome this communication from the Commission which provides the necessary clarity on these issues and a real focus on how the European Union should proceed and probably do these things better in the future. The main point, as Mr Fava has said, is that simply holding periodic elections is not enough to guarantee democracy in any circumstances. Elections are not just about a snapshot on a day; what is at stake is how we cover the whole electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the strong emphasis in the report that we are looking at this evening. It is essential that any verdict given by the European Union does not inadvertently legitimise, endorse or give any kind of support to any kind of dubious electoral process. The phrase "free and fair" should be avoided: it is loaded vocabulary which is always ruthlessly targeted by the media in any post-election circumstances. As the European Union's representative in Cambodia I was very well aware of how difficult that phraseology was. It is also very important for us to emphasise the need to support domestic observer teams. These are the key people in developing countries who understand social, political and cultural issues which we, when we parachute in to observe elections, might not be aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Parliament: we recommend that Parliament sets up an election coordinating group able to provide much faster and more efficient responses. I also would like to ask the Commission what resources, particularly staffing, will be dedicated to the important task of delivering the aims of this very important communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament is a central player in the Union's efforts to cover elections. Our credibility is at stake here and I welcome the opportunity offered to us by the Commission to define a very clear and shared vision of Europe's role in the democratic process in countries all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the European Commission has screened the EU policy on election assistance and observation and has come up with proposals for a better approach towards this policy, and for updating the same. Too often, this policy has been referred to as ad hoc and has been associated with last-minute delegations, with little impact and visibility on the part of the Union. In those cases where impact and visibility did form part of the package, most of the time, it was because the European Parliament had been handed the helm from a delegation – a case in point being the sterling work by Mr Gahler in Zimbabwe and by Mr Cushnahan recently. That is why the report by Mr Fava is so significant: among other things, it draws on the European Parliament’s extensive experience, and is receiving a great deal of support from our group, partly for that reason. All our amendments have already been approved in the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that is why we have not tabled any fresh amendments. Despite this, I should like to emphasise a number of points in order to bring our position more into focus.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the setting up of separate election observation units at the European Commission and Parliament. Not only should the units focus on the elections themselves, but also the period in the run-up to the elections, because it is often important to know whether candidates and parties are given fair chances before the elections. I would in this connection refer to the recent re-election of President Museveni in Uganda: it is now no longer a secret that his rivals did not get a fair chance at all to run a campaign. In fact, it is beyond me why, in Amendment No 1, the rapporteur and Mrs Kinnock propose to delete the phrase “whereas the election period is a democratic expression of political pluralism and must be organised in accordance with internationally recognised standards”. I really cannot see the point of this, and we therefore oppose it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that observers must be well prepared, so that all participants are aware of the potential problems they could run into in the country they are visiting. This can, of course, be done by e-mail and internet, but it would be good if preparatory discussions were held in addition. Furthermore, the delegations should preferably consist of MEPs mainly, and be sufficiently large in order to be able to gain a sound insight into the elections locally. The members of the delegations must leave for the countries in question in good time in order to observe the electoral preparations. They should preferably be headed by a prominent MEP or ex-MEP with sufficient clout to be able to stand up to people like President Carter, for it occasionally seems as if he is the only one who matters. In addition, it is of course useful and necessary for the delegations to establish good working relations with other organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union should consider mixed observation delegations, for example involving members of parliament from the ACP countries, especially if ACP countries are at issue. That can only benefit the strength and credibility of a delegation, and that is what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to express our appreciation for the Commission and the rapporteur’s report, and we hope that, thanks to that report, policy in this area will really improve in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that electoral observation and support for electoral processes are an extraordinarily important factor for bolstering the European Union’s action to protect human rights, democratic freedoms, democratic values and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">A point that Mr Fava made very well is that we must not isolate the processes of electoral observation from their overall context. Citizens are required, on certain occasions, to cast their vote, but the process of building democracy is a daily task. I therefore feel that the European Union’s action must be directed at ensuring long-term democratic stability in developing countries through the efficient funding of the corresponding programmes, in which the Commission has a crucial role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, Mr President, to focus very briefly on the role that the European Parliament should play in these processes. I think that paragraph 9 of the motion for a resolution contained in Mr Fava’s report very rightly emphasises the fact that, ideally, these missions should be chaired by Members of the European Parliament. There are three basic reasons for this: first of all, the European Parliament can contribute highly relevant experience, knowledge and vision on this matter, since, as Members of the European Parliament, we have all been elected in open and democratic electoral processes in our Member States. Secondly, the European Parliament gives legitimacy to our project of integrating Europe and I think that Parliament is therefore extremely well-qualified to represent the European Union. I would say it is better placed to do this than the national parliaments. Thirdly, the European Parliament is ultimately one of the two branches of budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the world’s largest donor of development aid and I think it is therefore appropriate that the European Parliament should have a role to play in this type of process. I therefore hope, Mr President, that this report by Mr Fava on the Commission communication on EU election assistance and observation missions will contribute to improving the European Union’s external actions in an effective, visible and coherent way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially in Africa, elections are often accompanied by intimidation, violence, fraud or the elimination of rivals via constitutional reform, as was recently the case in the Côte d’Ivoire. The sending of observers is therefore very useful, but can also entail risks. Observers can be manipulated and played off against each other. They can be used as alibis to legitimise a regime which has gained power via unlawful means. We should therefore exercise the greatest caution, both at the time when we decide to send observers and locally during their checking and reporting activities. There is still too much improvisation going on at the moment. People are sent out without being properly briefed, knowing the background or talking the official language. A compulsory brief beforehand is therefore a minimum requirement. It is also necessary for the different observation teams to work together more closely. Too often, observers arrive late and leave early. There is a great deal of manipulation before the elections, by tampering with electoral registers or the banning of meetings of the opposition. Sometimes, the process disintegrates after the event, when a Head of State refuses to accept the outcome, as was the case in Togo. A small nucleus of long-term observers may be able to offer a solution here. All of this is only useful, of course, if something is actually done with the observers’ reports afterwards. In the past, economic or strategic interests have too often got in the way of the interests of democracy and human rights, unfortunately. Let us hope that the Commission communication and Mr Fava’s excellent report will be followed up and will lead to a more coherent and consistent attitude towards undemocratic regimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a challenging task and I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the team which I was privileged to lead and work with. I would also like to acknowledge the great cooperation and support I received from the head of the EU Mission, Mr Ilkka Uusitalo, all the heads of the EU diplomatic mission as well as the government and opposition parties in Sri Lanka and particularly the Elections Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Based upon my experiences there, I would like to make a few points in the context of the Fava report and the Commission communication, both of which I warmly welcome. The credibility of an EU observation mission's final report will depend to a significant degree on the perceived and actual independence of its work. It is absolutely imperative that neither the chief electoral observer nor any of the team pursues a political agenda in relation to the country they are observing. The mission must, at all times, act independently and be seen to do so. This means that the integrity of the team must never be compromised by actions which could be construed as having a bias towards any political party or grouping or NGO. Furthermore, while it is important that the observation team should consult local EU diplomatic missions, it must be independent of them and EU missions must not interfere with fellow nationals or the mission as a whole. I was fortunate that this was my experience in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also desirable that the composition of the EU team should not only draw upon youthful idealism and enthusiasm but should also have considerable depth and wealth of experience. One final point I would like to make is that the value of an electoral observation exercise is seriously diminished if there is no follow-up. If the final report of the observation mission concludes that there were serious flaws in the conduct of the election and makes recommendations as to how they can be prevented in the future, the Council and the Commission must act and both must be prepared to use sanctions in the fields of EU trade policy and donor aid to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union supports and intends to continue supporting election processes in countries in transition towards established democracy as a key element in our external relations policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on electoral assistance and observation was a response to a request from Parliament and the speeches this evening have indicated that we responded in the right sort of way with the right observations and arguments. The communication was designed to boost our performance in this whole area. The case-by-case approach previously followed was, it is generally agreed, no longer acceptable. Wheels were too often reinvented and roles too often confused.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission we want to see all three institutions fully engaged in the Union's support for democratisation, so I very much welcome this report. It is a useful complement to the communication which highlights the European Parliament's unique added value as the European Union's own democratically elected body. I would like in particular to comment on a few issues raised by the report.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a few remarks on coordination and information among the European Union institutions, which I consider to be absolutely essential. I would certainly welcome the adoption of appropriate arrangements among the European institutions to reinforce our coordination and to better define our roles and responsibilities, including the establishment of a Parliament election coordination group. Our coordination should begin with a definition of European Union priorities, based on an exchange of views on an election calendar which the Commission now produces. We cannot and should not observe or support every election. Human and financial resources are limited and many countries have no need for outside support. So prioritisation is essential and Parliament should contribute to this. A regular discussion, perhaps every six months as suggested by the report, would be very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we decide on how and whether to observe a particular election, exploratory needs assessment missions are now the rule. We will share their findings with other institutions in order to involve Parliament at an early stage, as the report suggests that we should. Such missions will determine the nature of our observation. As stressed in the report and the communication, elections are not one-day events. Observation of the different stages of the electoral process – registration, nomination, polling, counting and appeals – are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not interested in election tourism. Normally the advanced part of the European Union election mission will start at least five or six weeks before the polling day. The core mission must be experienced and have appropriate technical expertise. The involvement of members of this House in electoral observation missions plainly makes considerable sense. As the Commission notes, MEPs, as elected representatives, have a profound knowledge of all aspects of electoral issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to cooperate fully with the Parliament in this respect and to integrate any parliamentary delegation, if it so wishes, into the European Union election observation mission. It would also be involved in the training, briefing, de-briefing and deployment of observers. When participating in missions observers are, of course, bound by the European Union code of conduct for electoral observation and the general principle that the European Union must speak with one voice. So the chief observer must be the only spokesman for the EU election observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock asked how we intended to pursue this work in the Commission. We are currently finalising a restructuring of tasks between the Europe Aid Cooperation Office, the Directorate-General for Development and my own external relations DG. The idea is to establish, for each election in which we are involved, an election team comprising all the services concerned. Once the restructuring is finalised we intend to inform Parliament of the exact sharing of tasks and, of course, we are prepared to provide a list of staff as Mrs Kinnock has asked.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the recent experiences where Members of this Parliament, for example Mr Schori and Mr Cushnahan, have been appointed chief observer have been extremely successful and should be repeated. The visibility of European Union action is important. The best visibility is obtained by running an effective and professional operation. However, the chief observer should, I would hope, be reasonably media-savvy and politically experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainability is important too. Support for democracy, as Parliament rightly points out, is a long-term process. The Commission believes that the recommendations of our missions must be built into development strategies and also into our political dialogue with the country concerned. For example, the President of Sri Lanka will be visiting President Prodi and myself later this week. We will urge her to implement the recommendations made by successive observation missions, including the one led by Mr Cushnahan, above all for the establishment of a truly independent elections commissioner. The aim should be to promote changes and build capacity so that international observation becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On coordination with other organisations and the building up of domestic capacities, I would like to stress that the European Union has worked with many international organisations and NGOs on election assistance and observation and we intend to use the same approach in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's report deals with a hugely important subject. The European Union stands above all for democracy and the values enshrined in the rule of law, pluralism and civil liberties. We all know that democracy and democratisation, on which our development policy is largely based, are about more than just elections. But properly held and freely conducted elections are a necessary if not sufficient condition for democracy. So it must be right for this European Union, increasingly and rightly seen as one of the bastions of democracy in the world, to devote much greater effort to promoting free and fair elections in countries where the rights which we are too often inclined to take for granted are still fragile or under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Fava once again on his report which offers sensible and valuable advice as to how we can raise our game in this whole area. We look forward to working very closely with Parliament in carrying this work forward and once again I want to commend those Members of the Parliament who have already played such a distinguished role in trying to ensure that democratisation is a reality in countries all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
