<p class="contents">On 28 June 2001, the Council adopted a reform of the agricultural support scheme in the outermost regions of the Union. These measures go back to 1991 and 1992, and they have proved their effectiveness in promoting agriculture and the supply of these regions with agricultural products. Managing them has, however, posed a number of problems. The two strands of the Posei scheme, which constitutes the specific arrangements for supplying and supporting local producers, are characterised by administrative inflexibility. With regard to the specific supply arrangements, the Commission is required to legislate for what are often only modest variations in the quantities of products to be supplied in the outermost regions. This is not an efficient administrative framework. The support schemes for local production comprise a range of as many as 56 micro-measures laid down by Council regulations. It is not possible to adapt these measures without interinstitutional legislative procedures, a state of affairs that prevents any rapid response by the Community when it comes to adapting the support measures to specific situations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission proposes a change in philosophy regarding both the aid given to these regions and the adoption of a participatory method of decision-making. The new system would also allow the measures to be adapted quickly, taking account of the specific features of these regions. The draft regulation envisages the presentation of one programme for each outermost region in the Member States concerned. These programmes will comprise two sections: one on the specific supply arrangements for agricultural products – agricultural inputs or products designed for transformation – which are essential in terms of human consumption in the outermost region concerned, and another section on support for local production.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financing, the regulation affects neither the sources of financing nor the level of Community support. The Community will finance the programme under the EAGGF Guarantee Section up to 100% within the limits of an annual ceiling laid down by the Council regulation. A part of this support will be compulsorily reserved for support for local agricultural production. The amounts are calculated on the basis of the average of the amounts spent on financing the specific supply arrangements during the reference period 2001 – 2003 and on the basis of the ceilings for expenditure applicable to support for local production. A portion of the subsidised amounts will be integrated into the direct payments under Regulation 1782/2003. They are among the ceilings to be found in Annex 8 of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the reform of the sugar arrangements and to the outermost regions. Although they do not form part of the Commission proposal, I should like to make a number of comments concerning the reform of the sugar arrangements and the outermost regions. The Commission is well aware that the characteristics of sugar production in the outermost regions of the Community are appreciably different to what they are in the other regions. That is why financial support should be given to this sector through the granting of subsidies to farmers in the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The restructuring arrangements will be financed through the deduction of a specific amount from all the quotas applicable to sweeteners. The sugar companies in the outermost regions will not fall under these arrangements. These regions will thus be placed on an equal footing with the ACP countries in terms of price. This is an approach considered reasonable by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the French outermost regions, which were the only ones to benefit from support to outlets, will receive an additional amount of EUR 15 million corresponding to current outlet measures in respect of the reference period. The direct payment in favour of the outermost regions will be included within the single framework of the Posei programme which we are debating and, as a consequence, excluded from the single payment arrangements. The French and Portuguese outermost regions have benefited in the same way as the other Member States from the same increase in the amount of their direct payments, corresponding to the reduction in additional prices. In the case of the French outermost regions, the amount increases from EUR 39 million to EUR 44 million and, in the case of the Portuguese outermost regions, to just over EUR 1 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the Commission’s position concerning the amendments. In view of what I have just said, the Commission is able to accept Amendments 1, 8, 9, 18, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 32 and is able in part to accept Amendment 35. Unfortunately, the Commission does not wish, and is not in a position, to accept the other amendments proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(PT)</span><span class="bold"> </span>The archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, and the French overseas departments, are referred to as the EU’s outermost regions and are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few products. This concept of outermost regions was introduced into the EU’s primary law in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, and constitutes the legal basis for the Council to adopt specific measures applicable to the outermost regions, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner mentioned, agricultural programmes specifically designed to offset the problems faced by the outermost regions have been in place since 1991 and 1992. These programmes have encompassed two types of measure: firstly, specific supply arrangements, to support the supply to these regions of agricultural products destined for human and animal consumption, processing in local industries and agricultural inputs; and secondly, support for local agricultural production. These measures have had a considerable impact and have had a positive influence on reviving the economies of the outermost regions. As has also been mentioned, however, experience over the years has shown that greater flexibility is needed in the management of these two schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal currently before us maintains the previous programmes, but proposes a radical change of philosophy, whereby the management of programmes is made easier and the decision-making process is brought closer to those principally affected, namely the regions themselves, whilst at the same time maintaining the level of support granted in the past. The Commission’s intention to decentralise decision making and simplify the management arrangements is to be welcomed, as is the approach based on encouraging participation in decision making and speeding up the implementation of measures responding to their specific needs. I therefore broadly agree with the Commission’s proposal. There are some issues, however, that should be improved upon, and to this end some amendments have been adopted that form part of my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I feel that, given that there are no export refunds, no restrictions should be placed on the possibility of exporting or re-dispatching processed products that have received support under the specific supply arrangements. This is because production and the market in the outermost regions are often too small to guarantee the sustainability of local processing industries, which are essential for the survival of some agricultural crops and for a degree of diversification. Consequently, in some cases these industries need to complement their supplies with raw materials from outside and to export or dispatch their products to ensure their viability. I must also express my satisfaction with the measures announced by the Commission for the outermost regions in the proposed reform of the sugar common market organisation. Yet there is one specific question that this does not resolve. I refer to beet production in the Azores, involving the Sinaga company, which will have no chance of survival, either under the regulation currently in force or with the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, given the time limits laid down in the draft regulation for the submission of programmes and for their approval, I feel that the date scheduled for their application needs to be made more flexible, in order to remove the risk that the current regulation will be revoked before the programmes arising from the new legislation can enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I also wish to stress the importance of introducing the possibility of granting derogations for the outermost regions in the area of rural development, taking account of the specific features and vulnerable parts of this area, thereby providing continuity for the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as regards the basis for defining the financial ceilings, I feel that the reference period of 2001 to 2003 is inappropriate for defining the amount of funding, as this takes no account of the impact of changes made under the 2001 reform. My report therefore suggests that, in the calculation of financial ceilings, account should also be taken of exemptions granted under the specific supply arrangements. As well as representing a fairer deal for the outermost regions, this approach does not inflate the amounts involved in support currently granted to those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support that they have given me and, in particular, the Members from the outermost regions, who have worked very hard on this process. I should also like to thank the politicians and the representatives of the socio-economic sectors of these regions for their dedication and support while I was drawing up this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I wish to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I trust that Parliament will take this into account when it gives its final opinion on this issue as expressed via the vote. I trust that the Commission will appreciate the enormous importance of this issue to the outermost regions, and I naturally ask the Members of this House to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to tell the Commission that over the course of recent years we have already managed to achieve some positive results, by improving the provisions of this regulation on issues such as the aromatic wine known as <span class="italic">vinho de cheiro</span> and dairy quotas specific to the Azores; indeed, we have also been successful in blocking the Portuguese Government from transferring those quotas to the mainland. We already have the beginnings of an agreement on the extremely tricky issue of sugar beet and sugar cane refining in the Azores, to which the rapporteur referred.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I wish to draw the Commission’s attention to the problem that Article 4 bans ‘processed products’ in some language versions, and ‘products incorporating products imported under this scheme’ in other language versions. This issue is dealt with extremely badly in the Commission’s proposal; it may be highly technical, but it is also of major importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to do what it has done in other areas: to channel all its efforts into addressing this problem, to listen to what we have to say and to see what this may mean on the ground in these outermost regions. With this kind of attitude, we can achieve a positive outcome on this issue, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to offer a special word of thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, who supported the vitally important strengthening of this programme. The Committee on Budgets does not always act in this manner, but this does illustrate the committee’s great concern with the interests of the outermost regions.

I also commend him on the way in which he accepted suggestions from all Members from the outermost regions, who strove hard to resolve this problem that affects everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission’s draft regulation is to be welcomed, some amendments were needed in order to ensure the continued effectiveness of a scheme that has made a considerable contribution towards regional development, from the point of view of the citizens, businesses and, especially, agri-food undertakings. Of the suggestions and amendments that we tabled, I shall mention only the most relevant ones. The first of these concerns the annual amounts of funding to support measures for agriculture in the outermost regions. We share the rapporteur’s view that the 2001-2003 calculation submitted in the Commission’s proposal was inappropriate, given that 2001 was a transitional year in which the POSEI agriculture programmes were reformed, and that those reforms only came into effect in 2002. We therefore suggest that a three-year reference period of 2001 to 2004 would be more suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerns exemption from customs duties. It makes no sense for the Commission’s proposal to ignore this substantial gain for the outermost regions, hence the suggestion that the amounts granted in the three-year reference period be taken into account in setting the future ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is that of exports. We share the belief that, in order to satisfy what the Commission said in its statement, we should look into the possibility of creating a regional integration area, we should support the rural world in these regions and, to this end, we should pave the way for independent exports of processed products and imported products under the special supply arrangements to third countries, neighbouring countries of course, or to the rest of the Community. I have no doubt that this will solve the problems of various agri-food companies in all regions, but especially the sugar beet production industry in the Azores, as has been mentioned previously.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these aspects, I hope that the Commission will take on board the opinion not only of these Members, but of Parliament as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I share and support the rapporteur’s positions, in particular those concerned with making the management of support schemes for agriculture in the outermost regions more flexible and with the prime objective of adopting a decentralised approach that encourages participation and that ensures that the measures in force are, where necessary, implemented swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of this philosophy, the Member States are now planning to submit to the Commission one programme per outermost region, which will cover the two strands of the Posei agriculture schemes – the specific supply arrangements and the support scheme for local production. Each programme will contain a description of the current agricultural situation, its weaknesses and potential, the proposed strategy, the expected impact and a timetable of implementation. This will enable each outermost region to define its own agriculture development strategy to cater to its specific needs. Accordingly, due account can finally be taken of the double insularity faced by producers and operators on some islands that form part of certain outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to highlight the rapporteur’s suggestions as regards developing an effective policy to help small- and medium-sized enterprises in the agri-food sector of the outermost regions. This measure has had a positive effect on the agriculture sector, on jobs and on trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot finish without mentioning a good example of the implementation of the concept of outermost region enshrined in Article 299(2) of the Treaty. The agricultural and supply policies provide for special treatment tailored to the specific reality of each outermost region, and this special treatment has been improved upon and strengthened in the light of experience gained with the implementation of the Posei schemes. This certainly sets an example that ought to be followed when adapting the remaining common EU policies to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In light of the specific features of the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult climate and economic dependence on a few products, all of which combined have a detrimental effect on their development, these regions rightly enjoy special protection, which is enshrined in Article 299 of the Treaty. This protection is, moreover, the result of successive decisions by Parliament, the proceedings of the Seville European Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the conclusions of the third report on economic and social cohesion. Accordingly, it must, as a matter of urgent priority, be translated fully into practical reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission issued a timely communication aimed at establishing a stronger partnership for the outermost regions entitled ‘a stronger partnership’, which deserves a favourable response. The report before us – on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions – forms part of the process of implementing that strategy. The agriculture sector is hugely important to these regions, and this report represents substantial and noteworthy progress in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the initiative can and must be improved considerably, and this report by Mr Freitas can play a substantial role in achieving such an improvement. I wish to congratulate Mr Freitas on his dedication and positive attitude during the process of drawing up the report, and those congratulations are extended to all of those Members who were actively involved and who made relevant contributions towards finding appropriate solutions to the specific characteristics of each region. Special mention, in this connection, goes to the draftsmen Mr Casaca of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Jardim Fernandes of the Committee on Regional Development and Mr Assis of the Committee on International Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the proposal for a regulation before us does not provide for changing the sources of funding or the pace of support, it will, however, introduce greater flexibility in implementing different measures and better adaptation to the specific features of each outermost region. This will be achieved by means of stepping up participation in the decision-making process, which is a positive step and one that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal suffers, however, from shortcomings and gaps on a number of aspects. We now have the opportunity to plug those gaps, on the platform of the broad consensus that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development managed to attract through the proposals it adopted, not to mention the opinions adopted by other committees. We therefore have ample reason to call on Members from all sides of this House to use their vote on the relevant amendments that have been tabled to express their solidarity with some of the more problematic regions of the EU. After all, we want to see the Union become more economically and socially cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to welcome the most relevant proposals adopted in this House and we feel sure that both it and Parliament will be equal to the task of meeting the legitimate expectations of the people and authorities of the outermost regions. Today we have seen a degree of openness on the part of Mr Michel; time will tell if there is more to come in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way in which the objectives which were clearly and objectively set out in the preamble to the Council’s proposal for a regulation under discussion and which we fully endorse can be achieved more satisfactorily and more quickly. What we really need is to work towards strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outermost regions of the European Union suffer from geographical, climatic and economic conditions that are adverse in comparison with those prevailing in the others, a situation the particularities of which the EU has acknowledged and, indeed, mentioned in Article 299(2) of the European Communities Treaty. It is therefore the EU’s business to ensure that its more distant regions can share in the development of the whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As agriculture is an important means of support for the economies of the outermost regions, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a Council regulation on special measures for it. Measures of this kind, formerly provided by programmes going as far back as 1991, are now indispensable to the outermost regions’ development, ensuring on the one hand that these can be supplied with the agricultural products they need for life, while also, on the other, promoting the local production, marketing and processing of such products.</p>
<p class="contents">By providing for decentralisation and simplified management tools, the Commission proposal ensures a more flexible approach to the EU’s outermost regions, and this is something that I very much welcome, believing as I do that the best solutions to problems are, as a rule, to be found locally, where there is most knowledge of a given region’s particular circumstances. This is the only way in which we will, in the long term, be able to make the outermost regions more competitive, enabling them to make up for lost time and catch up with the rest of the EU, for suspending, on a permanent basis, the rules of the internal market or using money from the Structural Funds cannot be sustainable solutions in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore delighted that this particular Community initiative has been launched, with the aim of supporting agriculture in regions that are geographically remote and that have only limited access to the common market.</p>
<p class="contents">The most interesting aspects of this report would appear to be the concern that crops which have traditionally been grown in a certain area, and which are characteristic of that area, should continue to be cultivated, and be exported throughout the EU with a special EU. The EU should provide particular support to local and non-industrial manufacturing processes, since the products of such processes have a better taste and flavour. As I see it, enabling cheaper exports to neighbouring third countries would also be one way in which we could provide appropriate assistance to outermost regions. This idea would merit consideration by the Community as a whole, including the new Member States, which have long-standing ties with their non-EU neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">This would solve the problems we face with regard to the poor eastern regions of the EU, which are located in Poland and elsewhere and which share borders with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. The economies of these Member States have suffered as a result of the restrictions imposed on trade with those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission has, however, committed itself to ensuring that the proposed reform will not bring into question either the timeliness of the measures or the way in which they operate and will not affect either the sources of financing or the level of Community support. The fact is that certain conditions laid down by the draft regulation imply more complex evaluation procedures, programming, monitoring and control for the beneficiaries than does the present framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the budget proposed for the specific supply arrangements, calculated on the basis of unduly strict historical references, would, contrary to the Commission’s promises, amount in reality to restricting the level of Community support and be in danger of curbing the development of the industrial sectors concerned, whereas if the Poseidom were not subject to any change until the end of 2006, the specific supply arrangements would continue to progress at their present rate and would therefore increase substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is now agreed in recognising that, without the Poseidom, it would be impossible for the diversification sectors in the overseas departments to develop. Implementing different arrangements now would be tantamount to saying that all the efforts made to date, by both the European Union and local farmers, have been to no avail. The excellent report prepared by Mr Freitas achieves a balanced compromise between the need for reform and the preservation of a system of support for sustainable agriculture on the farms of small economic size of the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the Commission and, above all, the Council will be very much inspired by Parliament’s opinion and avoid even partially bringing the current support measures into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank our Union’s Commission for the work it is doing in favour of the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Michel has said it very clearly. This is a success story: over the last 14 or 15 years, the outermost regions have benefited from special treatment via these programmes — Poseidon, Poseima and Poseican — which have allowed four million citizens, living on islands spread throughout the world — in the Central Atlantic, in the Caribbean and in the Indian Ocean — to have a decent way of life that is consistent with their needs. The programmes have also enabled certain regions whose people previously left those regions’ shores now to maintain their populations and, in some cases, even to bring new people in. In short, there has been a clear improvement in the living conditions in these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been achieved by means of a very reasonable procedure, which consists, on the one hand, of allowing agricultural surpluses from the rest of the Union’s territories to enter our territory and also enabling other parts of the world to import products. On the other hand, it prevents those imports that are necessary for maintaining living conditions from destroying agriculture and other elements of the local economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now being presented to us by the Commission is intended to make the system we had more flexible. As the Commissioner has said, it was necessary to adopt 56 micromeasures that were not in reality in line with the importance of this type of organisation. The amendments being presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are aimed at making the mechanism more flexible and must also be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out — perhaps for those people who are not aware of the situation — that what justifies this special treatment and this flexibility for the outermost regions is their complete inability to compete within the Union’s markets. In other words, the aid to the farmers of the Canary Islands, La Réunion, Madeira or the Azores is in no way going to prejudice the rest of the European Union, since the competition conditions are the same. On the contrary, I would say that these regions are going to facilitate the development of the economy in the rest of the Union, since they will have markets with a degree of purchasing power that benefit the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that this House will approve the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a large majority and that these measures will continue to function to our benefit and to the benefit of the rest of the European Union’s territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a need for special measures to be taken in all the European Union’s policy areas, particularly, of course in agriculture, and especially in its outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself am from a region, Lower Austria’s <span class="italic">Waldviertel</span>, which was for decades on the fringes of Western Europe and of the free world, and it too had to contend with some similar problems, such as problematic topography and climate, inadequate resources, a small and regional market and a scarcity of jobs. The Member State in question has been helped by support programmes from the European Union to build up innovative and self-supporting agriculture and to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity in real life is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. It is unfortunate that several Heads of State do not see that so clearly, particularly as regards the common agricultural policy. Following on from what the Council resolved at its summits in Brussels and Luxembourg, productive agriculture must be possible throughout the EU, in every region and location.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, it is the disadvantaged regions that need agriculture to help bring people employment and prosperity. More than that, the support measures we are discussing today enable our model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture to function as an example to those in all the parts of the EU that are far from the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">In many states adjoining the regions in question – and here I am particularly thinking of South America – an agricultural industry comparable to that in the USA is in the process of being developed. We are now being presented with an opportunity to create a sustainable economy by other means – the right ones in economic, environmental and social terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would essentially like to stress two aspects of the draft we are discussing today: firstly, the maintenance of the funding, which was approved in the last reform in 2001 and which, given the current situation, is no small issue; and, secondly, the decentralisation of management that gives local authorities the power to introduce the necessary flexibility in accordance with the needs of the agricultural sectors at any given moment. In other words, there is no intention to make changes in terms of the level of the aid, but it is intended to create a more flexible instrument in the field of management, as indicated by Mr Duarte Freitas in his Amendments 4 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s Amendment 27 intends to give legal coverage for imports of C sugar in certain outermost regions, particularly in the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira; there are certainly obstacles here, but I hope that the Commission can analyse the matter and take it into account in order to find the most appropriate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In his speech, Commissioner Michel made an ambiguously politically-correct reference to the management of the specific supply arrangements for the islands — I am referring in particular to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe me, Mr Michel, the people of the Canary Islands would like both the local authorities and the services of the Commission to guarantee the greatest possible transparency in the management of the SSA, of the specific supply arrangements for the islands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the debate. Allow me to reply to a number of important points raised. Firstly, I wish to reaffirm that the main purpose of this fundamental change is to give the Member States greater flexibility, which should enable them better to take into account the needs of the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the reference period – and I would refer in this connection to Mr Freitas’ and Mr Fernandes’ speeches – a number of you are demanding a flexible period for calculating the financial ceilings applicable to the specific supply arrangements. I think I am able to state that the Commission has made substantial efforts to ensure that the new support arrangements are favourable to the outermost regions. It has to be said that adopting the proposed reference periods would lead to a considerable increase in expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal constitutes a package. One cannot single out the more agreeable provisions and ask for those deemed less favourable to be reexamined. I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to this feature of my reply. The funding has been calculated on a basis favourable to these regions, particular account having been taken not of the historical figures but of the ceilings laid down for support for local production. The Commission is not inclined to modify its proposal concerning these financial ceilings.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to limiting the specific supply arrangements to agricultural products – a matter addressed by both Mr Freitas and Mr Casaca – the Commission also wishes to provide a clearer framework for the Posei measures. That is why the new arrangements concern only agricultural products, listed in Annex I of the treaty. The unsatisfactory situations that applied in the past when it came to administering the Posei measures need to be brought to an end. The Commission proposes transitional periods that should enable the various sectors to adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the Azores and Sinaga has also been mentioned. Raised by Mr Freitas and Mr Fernandes, the matter concerns the problems specific to the Azores and, in particular, to the Sinaga sugar refinery. The Council’s draft regulation does not include new provisions concerning exports and shipments of products that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1992, the Commission has been applying the same criteria to all the outermost regions, that is to say the average for the trade flows during the period 1989–1991. This approach was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in the Sinaga case. This needs to be pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunities for financial support for sugar production in the Azores have been considerably increased in the Council’s draft regulation. The proposal provides for funding calculated, where support for local production is concerned, on the proportion of the development potential for sugar production within the framework of the production quotas: almost EUR 4 million per year, instead of the current effective production of EUR 400 million per year. On the basis of this generous funding and within the framework of the broad margin of flexibility left to the Member States in choosing sectors to subsidise, it is for the national authorities to decide, if they so wish, to increase support for sugar production and the specific sugar refinery, following consultation with all the interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that these new rules will improve the supervision of these arrangements, first and foremost in the interests specifically of the outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be delighted to avail him of the relevant judgment of the Portuguese Supreme Court, which says exactly the opposite of what the Commission continues to allege.

<p class="contents">I welcome the proposed decentralisation, which grants greater responsibilities to regional representatives, given that the specific interests of each region must be catered for, taking account of different dates of accession and significantly increasing the amounts provided for. 2001 to 2003 cannot be an acceptable reference period, because 2001 was a transitional year. The system of limiting exports of products under the specific supply arrangements to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Community has served to choke the local agri-food industry. This happened with Azores sugar, the production of which must be made viable, and the same is true of other livestock and food produced using local traditional methods. Accordingly, the system must be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific supply arrangements, particular attention should be paid to Madeira vineyards and bananas, to Azores milk and to the special measures designed to help farmers buy agricultural fertilisers and pesticides.</p>

One is applied to the old EU Member States, and another to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no question that farmers living in the outermost regions of the EU suffer financial difficulties. At the same time, however, the 3.6 million farmers living in the new Member States face even greater problems. Farmers in the outermost regions have already enjoyed the full benefits of the common agricultural policy for many years, whereas the EU has graciously ‘allowed’ farmers in the new Member States to receive shockingly low direct payments, thus depriving them of the chance to achieve the levels of farmers in the old Member States. The decisions taken in this connection were not based on any economic or social grounds, and most certainly not on any ethical grounds. They do, however, pose serious threats to Europe’s food security and to the stability of the agri-food market in the European Union, as well as acting as a breeding-ground for dangerous social tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers from the new Member States are still being discriminated against. The arguments and expert opinions that have been put forward have proved meaningless for the EU authorities, as has the anticipated level of funding. One need only be a farmer in a new Member State to be deprived of any chance of obtaining support, no matter how justified such support would be. The pretext used is non-compliance with the countless conditions imposed by Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">We should put a stop to this discrimination, and we should begin this task today, by refusing to consent to the minor issue of support for the outermost regions of the EU. By doing so, we would send out a warning to the enemies of a common Europe based on solidarity, and let them know that only those who have previously acted in solidarity can later rely on solidarity themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
