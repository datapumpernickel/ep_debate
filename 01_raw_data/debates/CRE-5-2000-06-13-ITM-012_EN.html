<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hulthén (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we know that this question, in connection with which the third and final reading is about to take place, is a major problem for humanity. What is at issue here is the vital ozone layer which is getting thinner by the day. Perhaps we notice it most in the northern hemisphere, but it nevertheless affects every living thing right across the globe. We also know how we can escape from this problem. It sounds like an easy equation, but it is unfortunately more complicated than that. There are so many interested parties involved in a question like this. </p>
<p class="contents">What we now finally have to adopt a position on in this Chamber is a regulation which would give us tougher rules but also acceptable margins within which industry could successfully complete the changeover. I consider that we have succeeded in producing draft legislation which provides sound incentives to change and which also encourages ecological foresight. Our task has been to produce an acceptable plan for the way development should look. By means of this regulation, we want to show that we can go one up on the time-frame under the Montreal protocol, and we know that industry within the Union will manage the adjustment required, even if certain parts of industry have done their utmost to ensure that this directive should never come about. </p>
<p class="contents">At second reading, Parliament adopted ten amendments to the Council’s common position. The Council was able to accept seven of these amendments without any problems. The remaining amendments, namely 14, 15 and 21, were not accepted, and we therefore began informal negotiations with the Council at the beginning of the year. Both the Council’s and Parliament’s intention was to reach an agreement without embarking upon the formal conciliation process, so avoiding possible delays to the regulation’s coming into effect. </p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment concerns HCFCs in certain forms of air conditioning equipment which Parliament had proposed should be removed. These were reintroduced as a result of our negotiations, but with a stricter phasing-out date. The second concerns a total ban on HCFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment which the Council was not as interested in arranging. In the negotiations, we agreed to postpone the phasing-out until 2015 by means of a review clause. I consider that this was one of the most important changes which Parliament contributed in its negotiations with the Council. The third amendment concerns an extension to certain time limits where, too, Parliament and the Council together arrived at an acceptable solution. </p>
<p class="contents">If we now decide to approve the Conciliation Committee’s proposal, we should have hoped to have seen everything signed, sealed and delivered. There are nonetheless still three outstanding problems. At the final stage, three mistakes were discovered in the proposed wording of the Act. By mistake, the export of inhalers for asthma sufferers and of pain-relieving cancer pumps had been banned. Moreover, the text relating to certain companies’ imports of CFCs contained a wrong base year. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will now be tabling supplementary proposals which, in accordance with the timetable and with a view to correcting these errors, will be dealt with during the plenary session in July. It was never the intention to ban exports of this kind or to have an out-of-date base year as the basis for companies’ import quotas. In spite of this, I should still like the Commission to comment on how these things could happen and should like to know whether the Commission considers that we are now solving the issue in the best way. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by thanking the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency, as well as Parliament’s Conciliation Committee, for their extremely constructive cooperation. Everyone has done their utmost to come up with a sound regulation and also recognised how important it is for this to come into effect as quickly as possible. I believe we have found a compromise of benefit to all parties. It will not repair the hole in the ozone layer, but it is a step in the right direction. My hope is that, today or tomorrow, Parliament will adopt the proposal and that, by no later than October of this year, the Union will have new and better legislation governing substances that deplete the ozone layer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1985, with the revelation that there was a hole in the stratospheric ozone layer, the media began to take a real interest in the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">After numerous attempts to reach agreement, the countries that are the main producers and users of chlorofluorocarbons, the famous CFCs, with the exception of the Eastern European countries, China and India, signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987. This was a truly historic protocol, because, for the first time, people understood the global scale of the profound climatic imbalances that could threaten survival, people’s health and even their lives. It has therefore been held up as exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent report by the European Environment Agency, entitled “Environmental signals”, was curiously alert, not only to the increase in ozone concentrations in surface layers, but also to the fact that the ozone layer that protects the upper atmosphere above Europe has decreased noticeably since the beginning of the 1980s, at a rate of 8% per decade. This is extremely worrying. This factor has occurred in spite of the decrease in chlorine compounds and despite the fact that other gases affecting the ozone layer and the troposphere have decreased as a result of international agreements, which have proven to be reasonably efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The production and sales of compounds that attack the ozone in the atmosphere’s upper layers have in fact decreased since 1989. According to the European Environment Agency report, however, the lasting effects of these products, given their long life cycles, means that the ozone layer will not fully recover until the year 2050. That is precisely why any action that the European Union can take, any measures that it can adopt to protect the ozone layer, are crucial, compared to which the controversies about global warming and the ‘greenhouse effect’ for example, are insignificant. Whilst there may still be doubts as to the scale of these changes, there can be no doubt in the case of ozone. Saving the ozone layer is crucial to saving the lives of human beings, plants and bio-diversity itself. </p>
<p class="contents">The amendments to the Montreal Protocol that are now being proposed go some way towards improving protection for the ozone layer, this filter which is so precious to life on earth, and to improving the apparatus for monitoring the trade in substances that degrade the ozone layer. The rapporteur deserves our applause and gratitude for her speedy work on this report because, where this issue is concerned, speed is of the essence.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first, the hole in the ozone layer started getting bigger over the southern hemisphere, i.e. a long way away, and for some time now we have had to face the fact that the ozone layer is also changing over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Since 1976, the ozone layer over Europe has been contracting continuously, and is now depleted by 15%. The Commission only informed us about this recently and warned against a rise in skin cancer ailments, allergies and eye disease. People knew as early as the eighties which substances led to depletion of the ozone layer and continue to do so. According to estimates, for every one per cent less of ozone, the earth is exposed to 2% more UV, which means that people are at greater risk of contracting skin cancer. I am therefore delighted that a decision has at last been reached on such an urgent matter, which we will use to transpose the Montreal Protocol at Community level and to go even further in some respects than the demands that were raised there. Although I endorse the outcome of the conciliation procedure, I make no bones about the fact that I am not satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the issues that have been controversial to the last, concerning the ban on partially halogenated hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which are mainly used in refrigeration and air conditioning plants. If we are going to opt for a ban on the use of these substances on the basis of definite findings pointing to the damaging effect they have on the ozone layer, then I would have hoped for a more consistent approach on the part of the Council as regards transitional periods and exemptions, particularly as ecofriendly alternative substances are available for all types of application.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the ban on using virgin HCFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning plants will not take effect until the year 2010, whereas the European Parliament had called for it to be 2005. And in the case of recycled HCFCs, the full ban will not take effect until 2015, rather than 2007, which is what the European Parliament wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">But cleverly, a transitional clause was incorporated which allows for a modification of the phase-out date of recycled HCFCs. I believe that reports on further damage to the ozone layer and also new scientific findings as regards alternative substances will soon show the present compromise up as having fallen too short. Time will tell, and if my prognosis is right then the European Parliament will soon be raising the issue of the phase-out dates for partially halogenated HCFCs again, and will be in a position to deal with this matter in the interests of the environment and public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to congratulate both institutions on the major efforts they have made to reach agreement concerning the many technical questions which characterise this complex regulation. We have both worked hard to find compromises and to ensure that we obtain effective environmental legislation in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to take the opportunity to express special thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the European Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee and, especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Hulthén, for the thorough and constructive work they have done. </p>
<p class="contents">This new regulation envisages a range of measures to minimise discharges of ozone-depleting substances. The most important of these are further measures to reduce the production and use of HCFCs, the phasing-out of the production and consumption of methyl bromide by the year 2004, a ban on the use of substances such as CFCs and halogens, the production of which is already banned, stricter requirements for the handling of ozone-depleting substances, new staff training requirements, compulsory recycling and disposal and improved supervision and licensing requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">Adopting this regulation will lead to a more rapid phasing-out of all ozone-depleting substances within the European Union than is possible under the Montreal Protocol. This will not only lead to clear improvements in the health of EU citizens but will also mean the European Union’s accepting the political leadership of the world on this important issue. </p>
