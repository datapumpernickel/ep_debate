That is why I am glad that the committee accepted by an overwhelming majority the report on respect for, and promotion of, the values on which the Union is based, which I am presenting to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, Members belonging to all the political groups signalled their unanimous determination to defend fundamental values and the Union’s principles of democracy and of the rule of law, values against which international terrorism has declared itself to be targeted, but which can lead to conflict in combating that same terrorism, that are also jeopardised by rising xenophobia, by racism and anti-Semitism in Europe, as well as by political extremism. It makes no sense to close your eyes to it; I believe instead that the times demand that we prepare ourselves for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Commission for, by its communication, making an essential contribution to the dialogue between the institutions and to close cooperation between them, which I regard as indispensable where the application of Article 7(1) and (2) is concerned. Although the rapporteur and the committee both had criticisms to make of the Commission communication, I do believe that we have, today, been able to make a number of proposals as to how this position might be further developed.</p>
<p class="contents">It appeared both to me and to the committee that a higher level of protection than that proposed by the Commission was indispensable, especially in drawing a distinction between a clear risk under Article 7(1) and a serious breach, as was, in our view, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution. Although the acceptance of this by all the institutions and the governments of the Member States does not make it binding in law, it is binding in a political sense, so that decisions taken by reference to Article 7 are discretionary and political, and can therefore be taken only on the basis of it and in full accord with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was rather disconcerted – as indeed was I myself – by the lack of appreciation of Parliament’s particular responsibilities, which are virtually absent from the Commission communication. According to Article 7(1) Parliament possesses the power of initiative, and both paragraphs accord it the right of approval. What this means is that whether or not the criteria and principles that Parliament chooses for this procedure are actually recognised by other institutions as well will be a quite essential consideration. In my report, I originally proposed an interinstitutional agreement to embed these principles and make them binding on the other institutions, but I wholly accept the committee’s decision to initiate an interinstitutional dialogue on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes very definite principles, which I hope are also forward-looking, and these are meant to deal with the qualms and misgivings felt by Members of the House, and also by other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of confidence states that it is for our Member States, through their constitutions and institutions, to take active steps to defend the fundamental rights and values of the Union against breaches and the risk thereof; we are also persuaded that they must also be willing and able to do so. This House reiterates and affirms that it has this confidence. Secondly, with regard to the principle of plurality of opinion on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, we reaffirm Parliament’s intention that Article 7 must never be used as an instrument of political opposition. The principle of equality also applies, despite the widespread misgivings about it, and it is intended that it should be embedded, in other words, that Member States should be treated equally, irrespective of their size, their contribution to the Budget, or the length of time they have been Member States. I will conclude by saying that I attach particular importance to the principle of openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Although neither I nor anyone else here wants things to go that far, this procedure will, if it does so, give rise to major tensions. The debates at the start of this session showed us how very difficult it will be, in a state of emergency, to implement such a procedure with confidence, wisdom, and fairness. It is my belief that, in the event of such a procedure, Parliament would need a great deal of public credibility and so, contrary to what the Commission proposes, it is not a separate procedure that such circumstances require, but the absolute openness of all procedures, which the possibility of sanctions makes all the more necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, brings me to my conclusion. Parliament believes that the sanctions issue must indeed be addressed, and that it cannot be the subject of speculation, so that nowhere – whether outside the EU or within it – can there be even the least doubt about this Union’s determination to use all the means available to it in the defence of fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report which replies to the Commission's communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union. In that communication, which was addressed to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission aimed to provide a framework for analysis of the conditions for the application of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union in order to initiate a dialogue with the other two institutions responsible for implementing this important provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased with the favourable reaction of Parliament to the principle of this Commission initiative. Fundamental rights and the rule of law are the foundations of the European Union and a significant departure by any Member State from these values threatens to call into question the common values upon which the Union was built. For this reason, the Commission's communication underlined prevention as a means of obviating the need to resort to Article 7 or, in any event, to impose the penalties provided for by this Article. Evidently, penalties should still be resorted to if necessary – let us be clear on this particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">As the draft resolution rightly stressed, the Union must first and foremost have confidence in Member States and their own institutions, for example the constitutional courts. However, as part of a preventive approach it is undoubtedly necessary, as has in fact been requested by Parliament, for the Union to monitor respect for fundamental rights, and for independent European expertise to be developed in this area. As you are aware, we have put in place a network of independent experts which my colleague Mr Vitorino commented on at length at the last part-session during the debate on fundamental rights in the Union. Prevention also requires cooperation between institutions and the Member States, dialogue with citizens and information and education of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">A point meriting particular attention, and with which the Commission fully concurs, is the reference to the principles that must be respected when considering whether to enforce Article 7. These are the trust that should govern the EU's relationship with its Member States, the respect for pluralism, the principle of the equality of the Member States and the principle of the transparency of the decisions taken under Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">I note also that the report considers that the role of the Vienna Monitoring Centre could be revised with a view to providing 'independent and objective scrutiny on a broader basis'. This is in line with the European Council's decision in December 2003 to extend the Centre's mandate to convert it into an Agency for Fundamental Rights, which is supported by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Commission is currently studying ways of implementing the preparatory activities of the NGO support programme in the new Member States, in the areas of respect for the law, democracy and fundamental rights, in line with Parliament's wishes. This confirms the shared determination of the Commission and Parliament to encourage civil society to take action to support fundamental rights based on a preventive, positive and constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission welcomes the recognition of the importance of interinstitutional dialogue regarding the launch of the Article 7 mechanism. As I said before, this is in line with the aim of the Commission's communication, which was to institute a dialogue with the two institutions in order to develop a common approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There can be no question that the PPE-DE Group has always defended the fundamental rights and values that we in the European Union represent. The European Union promoted by the founding fathers in the 1950s was not intended to be an economic union, but a union based on certain fundamental values which we must guarantee, as the rapporteur has said. My group largely supports his report, although several amendments have been tabled, but we will vote in favour of the proposal the rapporteur has made in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that in Nice some of these values were incorporated into the constitution and that provision was made for establishing a mechanism under the terms of Article 7 in order to guarantee that values are respected within the European Union. I come from a country which has been attacked by terrorists over the last 30 years, and which, furthermore, was savagely attacked on 11 March, and, as the rapporteur has said in his speech, terrorism can only be tackled by means of more values, more democracy and more fundamental rights and the European Union must, therefore, be capable of guaranteeing respect for these values within the Union, in order more effectively to combat terrorism, attacks on our values and attacks on European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say finally – in relation to the rapporteur's report – that we share the principles expressed in it – trust, priority, equality and publicity – which can allow us to make progress on establishing a mechanism which prevents certain States from failing to respect the values which are so important to defend in the European Union, and in this very Parliament more than anywhere else. We also support his proposal to establish an interinstitutional mechanism to promote dialogue between Parliament and the Council as from the next legislature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both Conventions – both that on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that on the Constitution – our group was very active in contending that the EU is not merely an economic community, but also a community of values, one whose foundations have been laid over centuries, and one that is willing to defend democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law throughout its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">This Union of ours is a great thing, extending from Estonia to Portugal, and we have to ask ourselves what holds it together. It certainly is not the market that constitutes Europe, but rather the sense of solidarity derived from our values. Such is Europe, such is our identity – and that we must not lose.</p>
<p class="contents">We do of course need a mechanism to guarantee the maintenance of these values. The public would find it incomprehensible if a Member State were to get out of hand without the EU doing anything about it. We do not, of course, want to interfere in a state’s internal affairs – we are a Union with a great deal of pluralism and much diversity – but, when there is evidence of clear risks and of long-standing breaches of these values and principles, that is the time for the EU to act. I am very glad to hear the Commissioner say that such action may even involve sanctions. Cutting off funds from Brussels, not to mention withdrawal of the entitlement to participate in decision-making bodies, is of course the sharpest weapon one can use, but we have to make clear our willingness to introduce it if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Parliament as having a particular role to play in this, and that has been emphasised in the report, for which let me reiterate our thanks to Mr Voggenhuber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lack of definite procedural rules, though, means that the paper asserting the values of the EU has to be patient. Without such a procedure, the whole article remains a paper tiger. Such a situation is not exactly calculated to make the European Union more credible in the eyes of its citizens; you are all aware to what a depth that credibility has fallen in all our Member States. Putting it politely, I have to say that I am disturbed by the Commission communication that this report takes as its starting point. It is extremely disturbing that the Commission quite obviously does not want to impose penalties on Member States in the event of serious breaches of the Treaties. It evidently wants to fool us into believing that everything in our garden is lovely and is going to stay that way.</p>
<p class="contents">What else can it mean when the Commission, on page 14 of its communication, states bluntly – and I quote – that ‘it will not be necessary to apply penalties pursuant to Article 7(3) of the Union Treaty and Article 309 of the EC Treaty’? Such an absolution of responsibility would markedly diminish our own high expectations of our shared values and, ultimately, the standard of protection for fundamental rights and values in the EU. It also reminds one of the oft-used repressive phrase to the effect that what is not allowed cannot happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more serious is the Commission’s ostrich-like and nonchalant attitude to the protection of fundamental rights in time of war, and this is where the real scandal lies. The real scandal is the way in which the Commission virtually serves up fundamental rights in the EU in time of war on a silver platter. Let me quote from page 8 of the Commission communication: ‘On the contrary, a serious breach presupposes that the danger should have become a concrete fact.’ Purely hypothetically, the adoption of a law abrogating procedural safeguards in time of war would be a clear risk. Actually using such a law, on the other hand, would be a serious breach.</p>
<p class="contents">That really is something to be savoured; the Commission regards a law, in a Member State, abrogating fundamental rights, as no more than a clear risk rather than as a serious breach, without even mentioning the possibility of penalties. No, this is not on. This represents a point beyond which Parliament cannot allow the Commission to persist in going against the flow of fundamental rights, and so I am glad that Parliament has taken the initiative, in the shape of the Voggenhuber report, so that now, seven years after Amsterdam, something is at last being done.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this, I have proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the draft text more precise. In particular, these relate to the obligation placed on the EU by the Convention’s draft constitutional treaty, in its Article 3(4) in Part I and in Article 193(1) in Part III, to abide by international law, and I think that the Iraq war, which was contrary to international law, and all the misery inflicted on that country by the occupying forces, is evidence of the need for further tightening up of the report’s motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words we are seeing in outline the development of a central disciplinary system which will be able to impose on national democracies extensive or arbitrary definitions of their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 3 of the report gives a good example of this when it suggests that States which tolerate, and I quote, ‘a climate or social conditions in which individuals… feel threatened’ could be condemned. This sort of definition can go a very long way, particularly since Article 7 applies not only to the rights provided by the Union, which may be increased in future by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also to purely national competences, as the Commission communication clearly explains.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, therefore, there is a risk that in the name of respecting human rights a highly undemocratic multilateral surveillance system will be set up. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has delivered a very negative opinion on the report and it is right to do so. I took a similar line in the minority opinion which I expressed following the vote by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say, while we are on this subject, that I well recall the arbitrary treatment meted out to my own country, Austria, in relation to what we are talking about. The Austrian Socialists, who have for some time now been calling themselves Social Democrats, were fully involved in the underhand manoeuvres that were going on at the time. I also have very precise recollections of a telephone call from the then Austrian Chancellor, Viktor Klima, a Socialist, who was fully in the know and told me that all he demanded of me was that nothing should get out. Never again must principles of this sort be applied in this fashion, whether in party politics or in affairs of State, for without transparency there is no democracy. It is precisely for this reason that tracing the course of these events and making them accessible to the public is so very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
