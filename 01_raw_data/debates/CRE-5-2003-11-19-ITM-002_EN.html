<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to illustrate to this House the results we expect from the sixth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will be taking place in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before taking over the six months’ presidency of the Council of the European Union, Italy had a clear understanding of how big a part the outcome of the Naples Conference would play in the overall assessment of its Presidency. Indeed, within the overall external relations framework of the new enlarged Union, relations with the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean continue to occupy a significant place and act as a firm point of reference.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, the Barcelona Process has provided a means of measuring the state of health of these relations, often serving as a metronome regulating the pace of the dialogue between the two shores of our common sea and acting, therefore, as a force regulating – and, above all, driving forward – the dialogue itself, insofar as this has been possible in view of the events in the Middle East over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to the Naples Conference, Italy has been able at all times to count on the fruitful cooperation of all the partners, who, without exception, have demonstrated in recent months that they share our deep expectations that Barcelona VI should genuinely be a time of unmistakable reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. This need for reinvigoration is rooted conceptually in the Valencia Action Plan approved under the Spanish Presidency in April 2002. It was confirmed by the ministerial conference in Crete last May under the Greek Presidency and has been taken by us as a clear indication of the mandate to give shape to the common undertaking to place the Barcelona Process on a more solid footing. This seems even more necessary today, when the Union enlargement process on the one hand and the situation in the Middle East on the other are giving rise to a strong demand for Europe on the part of the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has, in the meantime, already given an initial vigorous and cohesive response by launching the new neighbourhood policy, in which it sets out a new unified concept for its external relations with neighbouring areas. It has also launched a more incisive policy on respect for human rights and democracy which, thanks, not least, to the substantial contribution made by the Commission, is already being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this new and promising context that the Italian Presidency intends to discharge its great responsibility fully by putting every possible effort, and all the energies that such an event requires, into the Naples Conference. This reinvigoration that we have in mind will only, however, be worthy of this name – it will, in other words, be qualitative – if it is able to restore to us a vital, dynamic Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. This exercise must not just involve officials and policy-makers but must ultimately be addressed to public opinion in our countries. It is worth specifying at this point that ‘a solid footing’ means something very simple in this context: giving the Barcelona Process the instruments, structures and mechanisms that will bring the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership into contact with public opinion, giving it the ability to have a positive impact on everyday life and to support and respect the various different viewpoints.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only in this way that a genuine, strong partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean can be consolidated. In this perspective, the outcome that we, the 35 Euro-Mediterranean Partners, hope to see emerge from the Naples Conference is an enhancement of the Barcelona Process through three new instruments designed to bring the Partnership into closer contact with the keenest aspirations of civil societies in the region. I am referring, firstly – and I am particularly pleased to be able to do so here today – to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which will be given a place with consultative functions in the Barcelona Process; secondly, to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations; and, lastly, to the new institutional and operational structure that the Partners will be deciding on for the future of the Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Fund, which was set up within the EIB just over a year ago to promote investment in the private sector – in particular small and medium-sized enterprises – in the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certain that these measures would give the Partnership a powerful boost, allowing it to forge ahead independently and giving it a capacity for action generated by the demands of civil society as conveyed through the parliamentary channel, by virtuous circles nourished by the mutual respect that synergistic interaction between cultures can instil, and, lastly, by a financial institution that is increasingly in tune with the specific needs of beneficiary countries and endowed with a wider and better organised range of instruments through which to act.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the underlying reasons and concerns to which the three key priorities set for the Ministerial Conference in early December correspond, priorities which we have interpreted in the light of the building of a reinvigorated partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The events of recent months have shown this to be increasingly essential if conditions of peace and political, economic and social stability are to prevail in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the formal inclusion, with consultative functions, of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in the Partnership framework is vitally important, since it is the Assembly, first and foremost, that will be entrusted with the task of bringing the Barcelona Process closer to public opinion and thus making good the participation deficit and, even more importantly, the communication deficit that the Barcelona Process has undoubtedly been labouring under thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">We see the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue as a structure that – combining pragmatism with a sense of perspective – can act as a catalyst on all the initiatives seeking to develop dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of the ‘Guiding Principles for the Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations’ approved by the Crete Conference. The Naples Conference itself will have the task of sanctioning the creation of the Foundation and, we hope, making<span class="bold"> </span>the choice of location official at the same time. Finally, we consider it to be fundamentally important to improve the operation of the FEMIP by tailoring its instruments more closely to the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses and the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Naples will be focusing mainly on these issues, but there is more: the Conference will have the added objective of confirming the undertaking to develop the Partnership in political and security matters as well, introducing fuller cooperation on the ESDP and more in-depth dialogue on the particularly thorny issue of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic dimension, Naples will – amongst other things – provide an opportunity for convergence and evaluation of the results of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Trade held in Palermo in July 2003. It will also give us the chance to consider the outcome of the first Euro-Mediterranean Conference of the Ministers for Agriculture which will be held in Venice on 27 November, and the Conference on Investment, Infrastructure and Energy which will be taking place immediately before Barcelona 6, on 1 and 2 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The social and cultural agenda will, inevitably, largely be taken up by the debate on the Foundation but it will certainly provide an opportunity to assess the progress made since the launch of the regional programme on Good Governance and the Strengthening of the Rule of Law, which is a crucial factor for the future of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the fields of justice, policing and immigration policy. The debate on this last issue, in particular, will underline the importance of adopting a balanced approach to the management of migratory policy, which, if properly oriented, could make a positive contribution to the socio-economic growth of the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">Again with the objective of bringing the Partnership closer to public opinion, the Naples Conference will welcome the launch of cooperation between the regional authorities in the countries on the two shores of the Mediterranean, a process in which the forthcoming interregional conference in Palermo will be an important landmark. Moreover, Naples should also take note of a mechanism for the involvement of civil society, the special Forum that will be held in that city on the eve of the Conference. The Forum will be open to a wider range of participants and be structured coherently in such a way as to increase the impact and profile of the exercise. Finally, the Conference will record the conclusions of the meeting of the bodies representing the social forces which has just taken place in Malta under the auspices of the European Social Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will be included in the powerful message which, we trust, will be sent out from the Naples Conference. To achieve these objectives, we are working to ensure that the positions of all the Euro-Mediterranean Partners on these issues converge at this event. We are doing so in a spirit of pragmatism and following a strategic approach that should make it possible to reconcile diverse interests in order to build and nurture – in the new conceptual framework of the Wider Europe – a more solid relationship between the two shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can say that we are on the right road.</p>

Through its opinions and resolutions adopted ahead of foreign ministers’ conferences, Parliament has made important contributions to the development of this Partnership. It was the driving force in fostering cooperation between the parliaments of the Euro-Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the working party has now reached agreement on a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Commission looks forward to welcoming it in Naples as an advisory body and as one of the institutions of the Barcelona Process. What role is it to play? It is the view of the Commission that the Assembly will effectively promote respect for human rights and democratisation in the region. The communication which the Commission published on this subject in May was welcomed by Parliament and the Council. We will now be discussing with our Mediterranean partners the action plans that will be implemented with MEDA Programme funding to bring about concrete improvements in human rights and democracy in all partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Mediterranean area is one of the regions of the world that are probably the most seriously affected by the risks of the twenty-first century, be it terrorism, trafficking in human beings, drugs, the problems of globalisation or environmental hazards. It is important for Europe to show solidarity with its neighbouring region in this situation. Solidarity by helping our partners to face these challenges in a way that is compatible with respect for human rights and democratic principles. But we cannot achieve more than our partners themselves want. That is why political reforms must be an essential part of the plan. The new <span class="italic">Wider Europe, </span>new neighbourhood strategy that will be debated in this House this afternoon sets out very precisely what we can do to get greater progress in political and economic reform in the region. I do not want to say anything about that now, as there will be ample opportunity this afternoon. I would like to point out that we have made progress on a number of fronts, which will be evaluated in Naples, and on which further progress will have to be built. I would also like to point out that North-South integration alone is not enough. We must also continue to support integration between our partners. Here, too, there has been progress in some areas but I am sure we should encourage them to further efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in conclusion that intercultural dialogue must play a special part in our entire concept. The importance of intercultural dialogue was recognised very early in the Barcelona Process and it has found expression in joint programmes to assist the development of cultural heritage, audio-visual co-productions and youth exchanges. In the run-up to the Valencia conference of foreign ministers, the Commission put forward the proposal, which was finally approved, to complement these programmes with an independent Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations. I am very pleased that we are close to agreement and I hope that agreement can also be reached at the Naples conference on the location of the Foundation. All the candidates, Rome, Valetta and Alexandria, have points in their favour and I do not want to express an opinion on them here, only to point out that it is important that the Foundation should be able to begin work by the middle of next year. It will make an important contribution to raising the profile of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and increasing its visibility and importance for the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Parliamentary Assembly is an instrument for political cooperation which both reminds the Member States of their responsibilities precisely through parliamentary measures and gathers strength for new measures. The next step in Naples must be swift action on the part of the Council to implement the decisions already taken during the Valencia Ministerial Conference, especially the initiatives based on culture and dialogue between societies – both bilateral and multilateral initiatives – in order to reinvigorate the neighbourhood policy which is the key to the balance and development of the Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">The transformed institution will, moreover, have to adopt a working model for which we can all see the need. Our decisions must be put into practice for, in this area, we must admit that we have failed somewhat. If we consider the Barcelona process, Meda, Meda II and the Valencia Conference, and the past and present expectations raised by these developments, it may be that we have failed somewhat in implementing all the decisions taken. A great deal of work has been accomplished but, without a doubt, there is still some to be completed, and the Assembly is clearly the right body to verify whether we have observed and achieved the objectives we set ourselves, particularly as regards the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, for a genuine, coherent, effective Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must fully incorporate not just the social and economic dimensions but respect for and promotion of human rights as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Point by point, we would like to mention a number of developments that must be included on the agenda and seen as priorities. Firstly, a programme for supportive cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean in the fight against terrorism and international organised crime. We need to introduce specific measures to stem this flow of – often forced – migration, which is a tragedy for mankind. Secondly, we need to verify the forms of development of the section provided by the EIB for the Mediterranean and the Middle East as an instrument for supporting the goals set by the new strategy, with the financial participation of other Mediterranean countries; I would point out that this Assembly expected a bank to be an active operator in the area. Thirdly, we need to insist on the development of south-south relations. In my opinion, the Agadir agreement<span class="bold"> </span>is an important means of creating a genuine free trade area. Fourthly, the procedures of the MEDA regulation need to be streamlined in order to increase the effectiveness of the project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, alongside our work on these goals, we must reassess the Euro-Mediterranean policy in the context of the more general neighbourhood policy, which, at last, places the eastern dimension on the same level as the southern dimension. This is the signal we must send to our consultative partners and we want the regional dimension of the Barcelona Process to be strengthened in the action plans to address cultural and human relations, economic and trade aspects, social aspects, rights and security. I believe that we should preserve the complex nature of the Partnership, which has become very condensed and one-dimensional, focusing purely on free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards human rights and democracy, I feel we must stress that these are not just options; these dimensions must be integrated into the strategy and, above all, incorporated into our approach to combating terrorism, for, in order to combat terrorism, we have to break not just the vicious circle of terrorism and war but the vicious circle of terrorism and consolidation of authoritarian regimes as well. In doing this, I believe it is possible to launch democratisation processes with due regard for human rights in these countries too, as called for by the fundamental United Nations development agency report, which we should take as our guide in relations with these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also welcome the initiative to turn the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me, Mr President, to refer specifically to the relations which should be established or improved with a State of the southern Mediterranean. I am referring to Libya, where I recently had the opportunity to chair a delegation from my parliamentary group.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Security Council's sanctions on Libya were lifted in September and work is ongoing on resolving the issues relating to the compensation for the UTA aircraft and the attack on the <span class="italic">La Belle</span> discotheque in Berlin in 1989. Libya is present as an observer in the Barcelona Mediterranean process and has not been integrated into it.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Prime Minister, Mohamed Ghanem, said, Libya is taking the route of progressive privatisation of its economy and putting an end to state control. It is also prepared to increase its fight against illegal immigration, which is taking place throughout the length of its 2 000-km Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it will be difficult for the fight against illegal immigration to be carried out if there is no effective cooperation with the States of the European Union and in this regard, we believe that the European Union must reconsider its relations with Libya. This cannot naturally take place without demanding, furthermore, respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty and also the abolition of amputations, which are practices which still exist in that country, at least in a legal sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only a fair and lasting solution can allow peace to be established in the region. Only an end to the Israeli military occupation, the destruction of the wall of shame and the creation of the Palestinian State beside the Israeli State, will lead to peace and put an end to the unbearable and murderous chain of events suffered by the occupied Palestinian population as well as the Israeli citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">A glimmer of hope has been offered by the so-called Geneva accords, negotiated over more than two years by the delegations led by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo. It would be appropriate for the Foreign Ministers meeting in Naples to offer their support for this plan which demonstrates that there are interlocutors on both sides seeking a fair peace, in contrast to what the politicians, in particular the Sharon Government, ceaselessly demonstrate. The Euro-Mediterranean framework may be a valuable asset in terms of contributing to the establishment of a climate of trust allowing genuine dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">A first signal would consist of high-level delegations from both the Union and from the Arab countries in particular attending the official signing of these agreements on 1 December in Geneva, on the very eve of the ministerial conference. Another undeniable sign would be for the Union to apply all its efforts to persuading the Quartet to support this initiative as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conference’s tasks in general, the fact that Europe is concerning itself with its future neighbours, particularly in the south, is a good thing, as is the announcement of a Foundation for dialogue between cultures, the creation of which still depends on the allocation of financial resources. Nevertheless, the orientations proposed by the Commission in its preparatory communication are still worrying. It is not certain that the new neighbourhood policy is sufficient to instil ‘a new dynamism into the Barcelona process’, since the approach of simply integrating these countries into the great European market means imposing liberal formulae on them, without taking account of their specific characteristics or the serious economic and social problems they are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this model is being increasingly criticised, and since even the French proposals for a relaunch of the partnership mention ‘consequences which could have a serious destabilising effect’, the Commission is not challenged at any point. Without taking account of the impact study of the free trade area which it itself has launched, it is moving in the opposite direction by enhancing the reciprocal liberalisation of agricultural and service exchanges. As for the call to turn to the private sector, it still falls far short of the needs of the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This short-term thinking is extremely dangerous. All of this means that we need joint construction in the Mediterranean, otherwise the almost constant stigmatisation and humiliation which the Arab-Muslim world, in particular, is subjected to, in addition to inequalities, can only feed religious fundamentalism or the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with two further challenges: we must put an end to the obsession with security and establish freedom of movement. With regard to human rights, we should establish genuine specific mechanisms. I would like to express my solidarity with Radhia Nasraoui, the Tunisian lawyer, who has just begun a new hunger strike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, let us remember, the declaration at the origin of this process gave us great hope. Today, unfortunately, things are very different. The international context has seriously deteriorated and one of the theatres of crisis, one of the most important, is located precisely on one of the coasts of this sea across which we propose building bridges. What in Catalan we call <span class="italic">desencís</span>, that is, disenchantment, is today the general dynamic. The living conditions of the peoples of North Africa have not improved in any respect. The Andalusian coasts regularly wash up the bodies of unfortunate North Africans who have fled misery in their notorious rafts. This human tragedy will only come to an end if we deploy all the necessary means to help these people to establish their own social, cultural and economic development. Here, excessive liberalism is quite simply murderous, and I am not sure that the creation of a free trade area will be the solution to these evils. Neither have we seen any real progress towards democracy and the promotion of civil society. Our individualist societies are constantly refining individual rights. That is all very well! But we must not forget collective rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to mention here the issue of the Western Sahara. I have the feeling that the market here could affect the legitimate rights of these people to self-determination, despite the promises of the United Nations. The legitimate representatives of the Saharan people now accept the new draft solution advocated by Kofi Annan’s special envoy. Morocco, the occupying power opposes it. We must demand that Morocco accept this plan before anything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This very afternoon we are going to deal with the strategy for a broader Europe – the Napoletano report – in which we point out the strategic importance of a more solid and global relationship with our Mediterranean partners and neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Naples is going to conclude an objective which has long been pursued by this Parliament, which is the transformation of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a genuine assembly. I believe that this represents a clear message in favour of strengthening this relationship in all areas and it must have a fundamental objective, which is to guarantee that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation functions correctly, because this new assembly will allow for the monitoring of the correct application of the European Union's association agreements with each and every one of our Mediterranean partners and that monitoring has been widely requested by the European Parliament. Given the broad content of each of these agreements, which includes clauses of a political nature, which go beyond the purely economic elements, the task of the assembly in practice would be the political control of relationships between each side of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, I believe we must make progress in four areas. Firstly, facilitating freedom of exchanges. The closer we get to establishing an area of free trade, the more we will contribute to economic and social development, facilitating the emergence of positive synergies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the definitive implementation of a Euro-Mediterranean cultural foundation, and I hope that this conference will adopt specific decisions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must combat human-trafficking mafias more decisively, and this involves more active participation in the fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe we must not forget countries which are not part of the Barcelona process – I am referring to Libya and Mauritania. Parliament’s delegation for relations with the Maghreb is going to make them a priority in its efforts over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that I believe there are reasons for us to be happy with this impulse, which will be given institutional shape in Naples, and which will allow us to work on new initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we are at a key moment to relaunch those aspects which have made least progress in relation to the Barcelona agenda. And of these I am concerned in particular with the cultural and human fields. I believe we must make a great effort here.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a field in which we could make this effort, if we are able to work on it in all its complexity: movement of people and immigration. We should try to make immigration a factor which strengthens relations and the stability between countries of origin and destination. We should create positive dynamics which could have an effect in economic terms, introducing concepts such as ‘mobility’, which is more suited to our times than the rigid and bureaucratic rules with which we intend to manage immigration. We should reintroduce onto our agenda the concept of ‘co-development’. We will be able to do a lot of work in this field, creating European Erasmuses or supporting local cooperation in many fields.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this global perspective, we could effectively combat illegal immigration and its most horrendous aspect, which has brought us horrifying images, such as the arrival of bodies, one after the other, on our coasts. We could combat illegal immigration organised by human traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">A new agenda, based on the proposals of the Commission and the Greek and Italian Presidencies before Thessaloniki, in relation to immigration and the countries in which it originates, could strengthen the human and cultural pillar of the Conference. Furthermore, so that the people who live amongst us can be a factor in stability and the promotion of our values, we must also work on our integration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the Middle East conflict to the insoluble situation in the Sahara, from the total lack of control of immigration, with the almost daily tragedies on the coasts of Andalusia and the Canary Islands, to which we can add human trafficking, drug trafficking and fanatical terrorism, which is not only being endured by some of our neighbouring countries, but which is using all its resources to also transfer itself to our European territory, these are some of the serious issues which we should be concerned about, very concerned about, at the Naples conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have common problems and also mutual responsibilities and each party must take on those responsibilities. Immigration, for example, can only be resolved if, as called for in the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, the countries of origin and receiving countries take on joint responsibility for controlling migratory flows and combating the organised mafias which promote illegal immigration. Border control is the task of both sides, not of just one.</p>
<p class="contents">Development cooperation? Whatever is needed and more. But the political and administrative structures of the Mediterranean third countries must behave transparently, and must respect human rights in order to promote easy and productive parliamentary and political dialogue such as that which must take place in the new assembly we are discussing today, so that this cooperation is effective, something which is unfortunately not the case in some of those countries, and I will not mention them by name, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we have the Mediterranean on the next page. To turn the Mediterranean into an integrated whole containing almost 900 million men and women is our challenge for the next 30 years. In order to respond to this new challenge we need genuine ambition and instruments for dialogue. This instrument for political dialogue, which we need, is the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the Naples Conference must enshrine its birth, because only political dialogue can forge a genuine balanced, in-depth and lasting partnership. It is for that reason that the Euro-Parliamentary Forum has been in place since 1998. But with its informal configuration, it has remained a passive witness, overly dependent on the ups and downs of international events, and hostage to the conflagration in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In Naples, this forum must become a genuine parliamentary assembly in order to acquire a new democratic legitimacy, in order to fulfil its role completely as an instrument of dialogue for peace, stability and regional development. I am convinced that it will be more than that, because it will also be a new departure point for all Euro-Mediterranean relations. This is the opportunity to create a new ambition for the South. The Union appears to have finally realised this, today, by trying to give form to what is known as the concept of neighbourhood. We must not, however, be mistaken in our objective. To distinguish and honour these good neighbours may mean that they will never be part of the family. It is no longer the time for a fool’s bargain for the South. The free trade area and the credo ‘Everything but institutions’, which prevailed until now within the context of Euro-Mediterranean relations, have been left behind. At political level, we must implement the future framework for Euro-Mediterranean relations, a free Union inspired by the Council of Europe, founded upon common objectives and shared values: common security, secularity, the rule of law and democracy. At economic level, we must launch a genuine Marshall plan for the Mediterranean with a view to genuinely establishing this shared prosperity, which was already included in the Barcelona declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
