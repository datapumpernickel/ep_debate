<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cappato (NI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the over 17 thousand people who, in the space of a very few days, as soon as the news appeared on the Internet that we wanted to include in a first pillar instrument on the harmonisation of the internal market an explicit reference to the possibility of requiring the retention of data, of all data – <span class="italic">e</span>-mail, telephone, Internet, SMS and mobile phone communications – have roused themselves: 50 US organisations, the American Civil Liberty Union and many others have risen up in opposition to this idea and this proposal, which is still the most serious, controversial point for us, a point which the PPE-DE/PSE compromise has attempted to include in our directive in line with the Council recommendations, acting against the European Parliament’s position at first reading, acting against the position and the recommendations of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This late hour is not particularly worthy of such an important debate and, what is more, it might have been a sign of respect if the Member of this Parliament who introduced these compromise amendments, acting against all the positions of the committee which she chairs, had come tonight, at least to explain to us, to attempt to convince us why we miserable half-dozen Members who are still in the Chamber should, together with our groups and the other Members, accept a u-turn on the positions adopted at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is becoming absurd: a directive on the protection of privacy will become a directive clamping down mercilessly on ... on what? On unsolicited commercial <span class="italic">e</span>-mails. With regard to this matter – as my colleagues know – I have my own opinion, with which some people do not agree: I believe that it is not legislation, opting in or opting out, which will help us to combat unsolicited <span class="italic">e</span>-mails, and spamming is already banned on four or five grounds under the existing directives. Imposing one more ban will not make us any more capable of securing compliance with these rules. I would, however, ask the Members, particularly those who are of the opinion that receiving an unsolicited <span class="italic">e</span>-mail constitutes a major violation of privacy, how can you, especially you, accept the introduction, against all the legal bases – and I would ask the Presidency to examine this point too, to ascertain whether these amendments are acceptable – of an explicit provision stipulating that, although this is a directive harmonising the internal market, with this directive we are going to authorise the Member States – they already have that authorisation, and if they already have it, why include it, why add it now – to implement blanket data retention, with a view to requiring the blanket retention of personal data in electronic communications? Everyone is urging us not to do it: the companies, because of the costs involved – but, we could say, who cares about the companies; the non-governmental organisations; the organisations concerned with freedoms on the Internet; the European Data Protection Supervisor, instituted by Article 29, who is the chairman of the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, who had adopted a position of consensus – or rather, we followed his recommendations at first reading – on the guarantees which are necessary if any form of exception is to be adopted. But no! We have decided, or rather it has been decided by the PPE-DE/PSE compromise, that all that had to be abandoned. And why? In order to reach a compromise? No, for we have accepted the positions proposed by the Council in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that people can have requirements; I can understand the fact that the Spanish Presidency wants to bring this dossier to a close: I expect that these are the requirements of some of the Members of this House. What I do not understand, however, is how these considerations, alone, have managed to sway, are swaying the overall position of the House. It has even been said – and I think this is the worst thing that has been said to us – not in this debate, for, of course, this debate is taking place after the decisions have been made, but in recent debates we have held – that the positions were the opposite of what was being proposed. There has not been a convincing debate and, indeed, those who proposed the changes are not in the House to attempt to persuade us tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the fight against terrorism been mentioned? Do we need the clause on combating terrorism in an instrument harmonising and liberalising telecommunications? No, we do not! It is a lie: all the analysts were unanimous after September 11 in declaring that it was not data that we lacked but the capacity to analyse that data. What we need now is precisely an action combating crime which can invest in the capacity to analyse data, and requiring the blanket retention of data concerning all the citizens would be to take the completely opposite path, to set off in the direction of the mistakes made. I therefore call – and I am almost ashamed of my vehemence but I feel that, ultimately, the few Members remaining in the House deserve it – for the positions assumed to be changed once again, and I call for at least that clause which has nothing whatsoever to do with the matter – it is a third pillar clause, a clause relating to cooperation, justice and home affairs, which includes the possibility for Member States to make laws requiring the blanket retention of data – for that unlawful clause, at least, to be removed from our directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all wanted to avoid a conciliation procedure, but not – let me make this quite clear now – at any price! Mrs Paciotti made things very simple from the outset and specifically stated that she would support all the points that the Council accepted. That really is a strange position for a Member of Parliament to adopt! Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi then tabled certain proposals for compromise with the Council on behalf of our group, and we have negotiated on that package in countless meetings and discussions also involving the Presidency. The Council has of course, as always, now very cleverly unpicked our package for tactical reasons and negotiated all the proposals for compromise individually with the various interested parties. That means that for the time being we have accepted a compromise on data retention under which there can be standard legal deviations from the general European legislation at national level, rather than having decisions made on a case-by-case basis. We have also abandoned the idea of a time limit and have therefore almost totally accepted the Council's position.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of <span class="italic">e</span>-mail advertising, despite having major reservations we have agreed to the general opt-in. However, I regarded it as being a condition that the area of application should be broad if there is already contact between interested parties and companies. But instead we now have a very limited wording: companies can only advertise similar products and products already inquired about by customers. The area of application we suggested has also had the word 'cooperations' taken out.</p>
<p class="contents">I could have accepted all these restrictions as a compromise, and could also accept this if the Council had made some concessions to us on the final issue and had really accepted the opt-out position for directories of subscribers. However, in this case the Council was only willing to agree on a variant in which the decision is left to the Member States. However, that means that the Council would not even have remotely accepted any of Parliament's key points. I scarcely regard that as acceptable, and that is why I repeat that I wish to avoid the reconciliation procedure, but not at any cost! If the Council wants to play poker on this, we can play that game too, and for us that means remaining resolute and supporting Mr Cappato's Amendment No 14. Otherwise we will essentially only have lost ground during the unofficial negotiations, and not gained anything at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paciotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, here we are again, voting for third time on the proposal for an amendment to the directive on the data protection in the telecommunications sector and discussing opting in and opting out. Unlike the rapporteur, I am still firmly in favour of the citizens having the right to choose initially whether or not their data should be inserted in public directories and whether or not they wish to receive unsolicited communications. I am pleased to note that this is the position of both the Commission and the Council, which have also proved willing to achieve compromise solutions that go some way towards meeting some of the more reasonable demands of telecommunications undertakings. That is why Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and I have supported new compromise amendments. If these amendments are adopted, we will, at last, after tomorrow’s vote, have a new major directive which will help to develop the electronic market while safeguarding the citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we also had to find a solution which was acceptable to the Council to the issue of retaining data for the purposes of protecting national security. In my country, Italy, these data are kept for five years. Article 14 of the present directive already stipulates that the Member States can adopt legislative measures seeking to limit the confidentiality rights in respect of communications necessary for the safeguarding of national security. The solution laid down in compromise Amendment No 46 adds that, in accordance with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, these measures must be appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, that data retention is only admissible for a limited period, and that the legislation on the subject must comply with the principles contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and therefore, in particular, with those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the shared constitutional traditions of the Member States which are now – these traditions – included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all solutions which have to strike a balance between different interests, this one has to be assessed in the overall context. I feel that the solution is sensible and sustainable, for the European Parliament certainly does not have the power to make the Council prevent the Member States keeping traffic data for reasons of national security. We cannot prevent this; what we can do is provide a framework of guarantees and certainties safeguarding fundamental rights so that future legislation has to respect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the vote in the Citizens' Rights Committee and the rapporteurs have been pushed aside and there has been a cosy stitch-up between the Presidency and the leadership of the two big groups.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will uphold the committee agreement by voting for an opt-out system on directories to be possible. We will seek to take out the bureaucratic limitation that direct marketing <span class="italic">e</span>-mails can only be for products similar to those previously bought. But our main concern is the attempt by the Council and the big groups to confer broad powers to require telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to keep data which map people's daily lives and contacts, that is traffic, billing, location data and so on for possible access by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not disregard the case for some data retention for security practices, but we oppose its insertion in this directive because the huge implications both for industry and civil liberties are not adequately addressed in this context. It is dangerous and premature, and surely of doubtful legality as Mr Cappato said, to endorse a blanket EU regime of data retention as an add-on to a telecommunications single market package. Any imposition of these powers should be debated at national parliament level and then addressed in the context of EU cooperation on policing and crime-fighting, including guarantees for citizens' rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure today, being an internal market directive, is part of the package designed to open up the EU market to competition and enable telecoms and ISPs to operate on a level playing field. That is why the original Commission proposal did not contain any reference at all to data retention, which was added by the Council. I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's response on that. We need a proper and extensive public debate. Slipping through these huge powers in the slipstream of a liberalisation measure is quite inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only last week, the majority of our committee appeared to be opposed to an opt-in of unsolicited electronic mail, but since the PPE-DE has adopted a more flexible approach, the majority now seems to be in favour of this opt-in, in which case the Spanish Presidency is granted the honour of bringing this dossier to a successful end. This generous flexibility reminds me of something Groucho Marx once said: “Those are my principles. If you don't like them, I have others”. </p>
<p class="contents">I should not, however, be so condescending about the outcome of this U-turn. In all Member States, it is now prohibited to place cookies and send non-directed <span class="italic">e-</span>mail, SMS or fax messages to people who have not asked for them. Unlike Mr Cappato, I do think this is a good idea, but it is true that this ban will also need to be enforced if we actually want to bring about a change. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not only want to express satisfaction, however. First of all, something I am really unhappy about and that has already been mentioned by the Liberals, is that these days negotiations appear to be taking place not between the Council and Parliament, but between the Council and two groups. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the compromise that these two groups have reached concerning data protection is not such a good one. I fully endorse what Baroness Ludford has said in this connection. Why are we as Parliament, in this first-pillar document, over which Parliament therefore has control, now willingly and explicitly encouraging the Council to conclude agreements about the systematic registration of people’s surfing behaviour and other electronic activities in the third pillar, behind closed doors and with minimum parliamentary and judicial control? We should simply study this aspect more carefully and not simply include it in this directive, which deals with completely different matters. Let us not get the first and third pillars mixed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue is whether data retention should be permitted, that is to say the storage of communications data. What is at stake here is not just a move to a little more surveillance, but a whole new type of state monitoring. Up to now the police and other parties have had legal access only to what was said or written at the time of surveillance. This document is intended to make it possible to access communications after the event, thus restricting fundamental rights retrospectively. This is a new kind of police state aimed at intruding into our private lives.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, what happens to data the state collects about you and your Internet surfing patterns? That data is stored and passed onto the next government. No one knows who will have access to it then – it could be the normal authoritarian Social Democrats, or it could be Le Pen, Haider or Rasmussen. After all, even before 11 September no one was aware to what extent fundamental rights were being whittled away with the agreement of western democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">We have experience in Germany of such preventive restrictions on fundamental rights. The <span class="italic">Radikalenerlass</span>, or Radicals Decree, did not just involve charging those affected with illegal acts, it also related to acts merely regarded as undesirable by the government. So the effect of the directive we are debating today could be that if I download information about right-wing radicalism from the Internet now I could at some point in the future lose my job as a civil servant. This document still includes the term data protection, although it no longer relates to data protection. The only thing still to be decided is what the title will be of the planned Council proposal requiring data retention throughout the European Union. The directive before us today is preparing the way for that proposal to extend monitoring by the state across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The name of Mr Cappato, who is so hardworking and friendly, has almost become a swearword among MEPs and civil servants who have worked long and hard on this matter. Despite a compromise, the European Parliament and the Council are still far apart. Unfortunately, it is difficult to feel satisfied with the result, but separate national regulations would create even greater differences and even more problems. There is a great risk and lack of consistency in the Council’s position whereby the issue of the Data Act would be included in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues which fall under the third pillar quite simply do not work in a directive within the framework of the first pillar. The pillar system quite simply does not work, and the Commission, which has just notified us of this, is aware of the fact. Now, we are told that a framework decision is being planned on general surveillance. Citizens have reason to be worried. The EU must not proceed too quickly on these important issues which, under the guise of data protection, risk limiting the protection of personal privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">A proper discussion is needed between industry, politicians and interest groups before we proceed further with more new legislation. Maybe we just need to look a little closer at what other countries have done, such as the United States. The issues must be subjected to democratic and legal controls. I place my hope in the European Convention in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I campaigned on the issue of costs even during the previous term of office. I returned to the issue in my report on the strategy for “Creating a safer information society by improving the security of information infrastructures and combating computer-related crime” (A5-0284/01). This is quite a while ago now. Light must be shed upon the costs of compulsory data storage and of searching for information. I have received a positive response from the Commission on this subject, both in writing and orally. It is good to hear that the Commission has taken these arguments on board and promised to get back to us on this issue. I will content myself with this welcome message and have therefore withdrawn my request on this matter. I also hope that the Commission really will get back to us on the question so that we are able to address it not so as to adopt fixed positions at an early stage but so as to obtain reasonable relations between the United States and the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, opt-in, opt-out. I have to say, it is absolutely appalling, in any arena of politics, to set expectations which cannot be met. The whole idea of opt-in has been put forward as the solution to end spam. Let me put this on the record. The Commission's proposals on opt-in will not stop one iota of spam whatsoever. Spammers do not abide by laws or regulations. They operate offshore and if we want to drive SMEs, the so-called engine of the new economy, out of the EU, then this is the way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of data retention, Groucho Marx has been referred to tonight. Actually, there were three brothers and the contributions I have heard tonight lead me to believe that the three brothers Groucho, Chico and Harpo are present. The whole deletion of this article on data retention which is now being called for was never, ever called for in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this idea that it is a stitch-up, that groups come together to reach a compromise that ill serves the civil liberties of ordinary men and women? Civil liberties, let us remind ourselves, need protecting from the international terrorists who operate cross-border terrorism, drug-trafficking, transnational crime, the trafficking of women and children. These are the civil liberties that we seek to protect with these proper, balanced data retention rules that are in the proposals before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Parliament does the sensible thing, which is to vote in favour of the data retention proposals. We must respect the civil liberties of our citizens, and we do, but equally, we must not allow those who operate across our borders to abuse civil liberties to promote their crimes.</p>

We must ensure that our citizens and businesses do not receive unsolicited <span class="italic">e-</span>mail, that their personal details are not included in telephone directories without their permission, and that their surfing behaviour is not secretly registered via cookies.

<p class="contents">However, I am unable to support the proposal on data storage. In fact, I cannot understand how the Commission can back the Council proposal.

It would seem, however, that we are faced with almost a complete overturning of what was agreed at first reading: there has been a major reshuffling of the cards which has enabled the different groups to review the positions they had taken before, to alter them and to propose compromises which are frankly quite perplexing. We must draw a veil over the matter, so to speak, in any case,<span class="bold"> </span>and remember what it is we are actually discussing. We are discussing a proposal for a directive which seeks to amend the previous European Parliament and Council directive – Directive 97/66 of 15 December 1997, to be exact – which laid down provisions on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, and bring it into line with technological innovations which have taken place which were actually quite foreseeable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate my reservations, which I have already voiced at first reading, about the usefulness and effectiveness of rules which are so specific, too specific in their regulation of the telecommunications sector and therefore too invasive of citizens’ privacy. I still feel that it is possible to apply the standards which are currently in existence and endorsed at European level to achieve the same end while avoiding the risk of overregulation, of excessive regulation, that is. We need to avoid this alleged respect for privacy leading to the establishment of two systems or a system with two different sets of rules, which would mean, first and foremost, excessive protection of the citizens’ privacy and laying down excessively restrictive rules in the private sector, while leaving the Member States, on the other hand, absolutely free to intervene for their own purposes in the lives of the citizens themselves, for example requiring electronic communication service providers to perform tasks which almost amount to police work.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I trust that I will not upset anyone if I say that I agree with the rapporteur when he says, in Amendment No 4, that cookies are ultimately acceptable, almost legitimate tools, for they make it easier to understand how to surf the Internet, providing clear, exhaustive information; in other words, they make the surfer more alert. What I mean to say is I do not believe that surfers are victims of cookies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is spamming, against which we are completely defenceless: those who indulge in this practice do what they want to when they want to and, most importantly, in the quantities and with the quality they want to. At this point, I do not believe it will be easy to produce a directive which everyone can support. We have tried. If it were possible – and I know the Rules of Procedure do not permit it – we should resort to a third reading: it may be only then that we would find that point of convergence and consensus which, at this point, at this moment in time, we are realising that we have failed to reach with two readings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately we did not wait for this draft to stagger in as otherwise the other directives would also have been late too.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not been long since we realised that a crime is a crime also on the Internet and the fact that you can conceal your identity cannot release anyone from responsibility even electronically. You cannot even send <span class="italic">e</span>-mail if the recipient does not want it. Unlike paper-based advertising, this is often at the expense of the recipient. Therefore I am in favour of the compromise with the Council which supports the opt-in view. Direct marketing is possible over the Internet if the consumer has given permission for it in advance. I also support several other compromises. The result is not perfect by any means, but it is an indication of how far we have come.</p>
<p class="contents">'Internet insecurity', actual anarchy, is a major threat to the entire <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe project, the information-based economy and the advancement of democracy.

The proposed electronic communications data protection directive is the only element of the package still to be agreed between this House and the Council. Adequate rules on the protection of privacy on line are just as essential for the sector as rules to ensure competitive markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would like to ask you to join in the ongoing effort to try and reach an agreed solution on this directive at its second reading to avoid any further delay. The seven compromise elements that have been tabled by the PPE-DE and PSE, together with three amendments submitted by the Citizens' Freedom Committee and five further amendments submitted by the PPE-DE constitute a package of compromise texts that are acceptable both to the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, who has put a lot of time and energy into this file. May I also pay special credit to Mrs Palacio and Mrs Paciotti, for their continuous efforts to try and find an overall package that would be acceptable to all institutions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">On all four main and outstanding issues, some balanced solutions are now on the table. All sides have had to make concessions and nobody is perfectly happy with every element of the package as is the nature of a compromise. On cookies, Amendments Nos 25 and 26 align the relevant provisions with the general data protection directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On unsolicited <span class="italic">e</span>-commercial mail, the Council has accepted further concessions to accommodate those in Parliament not in favour of a harmonised policy. Amendments Nos 9, 18, 28, 44 and 45 are acceptable, both for the Council and the Commission. The exception clause would apply to direct marketing by the same company of similar categories of products or services. One such category could, for instance, be books, CDs and DVDs. Another category could be household appliances. This is really as far as we can go without ending up with unsatisfactory solutions for both citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a clear, harmonised approach for the entire EU market, that does not force customers to pay the bill for unwanted direct marketing by <span class="italic">e</span>-mail, SMS and other message services. This is the best boost for electronic messaging services and e-commerce in general.</p>
<p class="contents">On traffic data retention, discussions have been particularly difficult. The Commission appreciates the strong feelings in this House regarding the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms. The Commission fully shares these feelings and, like Parliament, is currently promoting the inclusion of a Charter on Fundamental Human Rights in the EU Treaty, so that it will become legally binding and directly enforceable.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have said from the start of the discussions, the directive we are debating today is not a third pillar instrument. It imposes legal limitations on what we can usefully include in the provisions of the directive, both with regard to any national measures for public security or crime-fighting and with regard to safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission has emphasised in its recent submission to the European Convention, we think that the separation between the three pillars causes numerous difficulties and should therefore be abandoned. But as long as the pillars exist, we are forced to respect them, because the European Court of Justice would not uphold any third pillar elements included in a first pillar directive.</p>
<p class="contents">For similar reasons, we cannot introduce a provision on the cost of law enforcement measures in this directive, as proposed in Amendment No 39. Nevertheless, I can assure Mrs Cederschiöld that the Commission will actively pursue this matter with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise Amendments Nos 46 and 47 jointly submitted by PPE-DE and PSE signify a very important improvement of the Council's common position on the topic of data retention. They strengthen considerably the human rights aspect of the relevant provisions and also refer to case law by the Strasbourg Court on the European Convention of Human Rights. The Commission fully supports these improvements and urges the European Parliament to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the sentence on data retention is deleted from Amendment No 46 as proposed by the requested split vote, the whole compromise would unravel and this would surely lead to conciliation with an even more uncertain outcome. The Commission understands the concerns that have motivated the request for a split vote, but feels that the current text addresses these concerns sufficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of public subscriber directories remains to be solved. While less debated that the opt-in for solicited commercial <span class="italic">e</span>-mail, similar issues are at stake for proposed harmonised opt-in regarding directories. A non-harmonised solution as proposed in Amendment No 35 is not sustainable with the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, an agreed overall solution between all institutions is within reach if the European Parliament tomorrow accepts Amendments Nos 9, 13, 18, 25, 26, 28, 37, 38 and 44 to 50. The result will be a directive with great added value for European citizens and for the development of the information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
