<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission approved its proposals for the specific programmes of the Research Framework Programme 2000-2006. A communication on the possible use of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to implement the Framework Programme was also approved. The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation. Therefore, the Commission’s proposals contain nothing other than the proposal for the Framework Programme, which must be adopted under the co-decision procedure. The proposals do, however, provide some clarification. As you are aware, the Commission approved the Framework Programme on 21 February 2001, and this new Framework Programme is specifically designed to help create the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate the main principles. Within this context, we presented the Framework Programme with the determination, on the one hand, to focus efforts on a limited number of priorities where Community action would present the greatest added value. We are also endeavouring to give some structure to the research that is carried out in Europe, through greater interaction between national activities, in order to create a more consistent European Research Area. We also believe that the management of our Framework Programmes must be made more easy and simple in terms of the means of intervention in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement the Framework Programme, we are proposing a structure based on five specific programmes. This structure is a faithful reflection of that of the Framework Programme and translates the political project into reality. This structure is as follows: a programme on ‘Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area’ which brings together all the activities involving research and coordination of research policies in Europe; a programme on ‘Structuring the European Research Area’ which covers activities involving the integration of research and innovation, the mobility of researchers and infrastructures and issues relating to science and society, and the links between science and the public – all increasingly burning issues within European society. We also have a programme covering Euratom research activities and then two programmes covering the activities of the Joint Research Centre, in the non-nuclear and nuclear fields respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of the proposals aims to provide clarification with regard to the scientific and technological content, which is presented in much more detail than in the Framework Programme. These proposals, however, also concern the new instruments of implementation, which are central to the philosophy of the Framework Programme 2002-2006, the creation of networks of excellence and integrated projects. Further details regarding the way this will operate will be provided in the rules for participation in and dissemination of the Framework Programme adopted under the co-decision procedure, the proposals for which the Commission will present at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">I also said that with regard to the communication on the implementation of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has never truly been applied, we have put together some suggestions on practical ways in which the Community might participate in jointly implemented national programmes. This is the meaning of Article 169. Our aim is, therefore, to launch a political debate on this issue. On the basis of these initial results, the Commission intends to present a proposal at a later date, on a framework decision on the general conditions for Community support within the context of Article 169 and the possible areas where this could be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I think that it is true to say that this is the first time that the Commission has presented its proposals for specific programmes so quickly after having presented the proposal for a Framework Programme. We believe, therefore, that we are responding to a request by Parliament with the aim of facilitating political debate, by providing this further clarification. This information also includes accurate and clear details, since the new instruments require this, and we have also planned an information session with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 5 June 2001. I believe, therefore, that we will have done everything possible to enable Parliament and the Council to approve, within the specified time frame, the new Framework Programme that is a tool for creating the European Research Area, which, in my opinion, is widely supported by the European Union.</p>

That is a major achievement. I should also like to ask him if he could answer the questions put to him by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as soon as possible. That will, in turn, enable us to adhere to the deadlines, which is very important in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two explicit questions to put to the Commissioner. Firstly, in the specific programme, the most important research, and thus the money, is earmarked for the human genome and biotechnology. This may be a major area of research, but the results will only become evident over a ten- to fifteen-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, many EU citizens still die, unfortunately, of the three well-known diseases, namely cancer, heart and vascular diseases, and signs of ageing, such as Alzheimer’s. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed a growing need for a separate life-science programme within the context of the human genome and biotechnology. I should like to find out from the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to help us think about setting up a programme of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question to the Commissioner is of a technical nature: the Commissioner delivered a comprehensive explanation with regard to Article 169 of the Treaty. Why does he not apply Article 168 of the Treaty? Surely that would be a far more practical approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You shall, therefore, have the answer at the beginning of next week, I assure you, and we will be able to continue the debate on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the two more specific questions, Mr Van Velzen has quite rightly mentioned health problems, including both degenerative neurological diseases and cancer problems, and he will see that, if these specific programmes are approved, there is the prospect of carrying out European added-value research on this issue, within the context of genomics and health. For example, there are opportunities in the specific programme to undertake clinical trials for cancer and degenerative diseases, which are some of the new possibilities opened up by genomics. This does not mean, however, that they cannot be begun immediately, since there is an undeniable European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Article 169, as I mentioned, we have produced a document, which is launching the debate along these lines, and we shall explain why Article 168 is not used in the same way. Mr Van Velzen will be given a very clear answer to this in the answers to the questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I understand you correctly, however, this Sixth Framework Research Programme contains far fewer specific programmes than the fifth and I should like to ask you why? What are the reasons? We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes. Up until now, we had one for biotechnology, one for energy, one for the environment, and so on. In future that is all going to be under one roof. Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible? Is there not also a danger that the lobbies representing various professional groups and sectors will be less involved in the Sixth Framework Programme because they are not clear what area it falls under? My question is: Can you give us the reasons why you have fewer specific programmes this time than last? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Framework Programme represents a considerable amount of money, but it only equates to 5% of public spending on research in Europe. We must not, therefore, expect the Framework Programme to fund all European research. What the programme can do is to contribute to acting as a catalyst for European research and to give it greater consistency. If the approach that we adopt is focused on too many sectors, we will then end up with many different measures and our efforts will be too dispersed. We have therefore attempted to tackle the problem by dealing with priority issues first.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just mentioned the problem of genomics, which affects many subjects relating to health and biotechnology, but in the field of nanotechnology, with which Mr Linkohr is very familiar, which is, in other words, developing technologies using more intelligent processes and materials which waste less energy and matter, a large number of sectors will be affected, including the automotive and the aeronautics sectors. We are, therefore, aiming for consistency rather than to cover a whole range of problems. I do believe that this issue concerning the number of specific programmes should not prevent a dialogue on the content of the priorities. We will, obviously, be able to go into much more detail in the content of the priorities. You will see that we will make a further step forward by approving the specific programmes. I believe that the dialogue established with the Commission will enable us to further clarify this determination to create the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the current shortcomings are well known. We are spreading our resources too thinly and Europe does not have a critical mass to devote to the main research objectives, in contrast to other developed countries such as the United States and Japan, and so we must create this critical mass. The European programme can help to achieve this, with new provisions, such as improved networking of national programmes. We must encourage coherent action. It is, to some extent, because of this that there are not as many catalogues of specific programmes in each area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That was not my question, however. Like Mr van Velzen, I would like to ask when we will be receiving a response to the questions we have put to you in writing. You, as no other, know how often I have asked the Commission on what basis certain priorities in the Framework Programme are, in fact, used and what criteria have been used in the process.

<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of choices, I believe I have told you that the main priorities, and I have already had the opportunity to answer Parliament on this issue, are, on the one hand, the work by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) and the debates held with the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES) with various representatives of the Member States’ scientific councils, and, on the other hand, the general trends within the scientific and industrial community, be it genomics, nanotechnologies, the problem of the information society, food safety, sustainable development, and I agree with you on this that there should be more clarification on issues regarding transport, the environment and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main lines were, I believe, defined in accordance with very objective criteria, and I have already had the opportunity to answer, but there has always been a choice. Ultimately, I am still asking the question – what else do you wish to add? Let us discuss this. I believe that there is a degree of flexibility within the framework of the specific programmes, but only on the condition that we do not fall into the trap of following a scatter-gun approach which would compromise the coherence of the Framework Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the need to create a European Research Area, and the need for the innovation that this represents, to make the Sixth Framework Programme more flexible and easier to access. I am thinking, in particular, of the European added value, which we will find if there is more interaction between the countries of the European Union, namely through grants provided to young people so that they can go and carry out research and work in other Member States and discover more about themselves. We must also be able to maintain the values and the knowledge that we have in Europe and not just watch these go elsewhere. Lastly, with regard to the specific programmes, I would like to emphasise innovation, this time in the area of sustainable development. This is an important subject, which we discuss a great deal, but it is an area in which still too little is done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to the fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is organising a meeting on this issue in Parliament, in Brussels and this will take place next week on 6 June. We would like to invite all Members to come and share their views on sustainable development, energy, renewable energy, the environment and ecology in particular, so that we can take these into account and make some proposals in this area which is of great interest to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two aspects to this issue; firstly, obstacles preventing researchers and teachers and others from moving around at present. A High Level Working Group met with experts from all the Member States and submitted a report to us, which will also be discussed at the Research Council on 26 June, and will be communicated to Parliament to present all the difficulties regarding mobility encountered by the scientific community. As I often say, it is more difficult for a researcher who has qualified in Europe to go to another European country than to go, for instance, to the United States. There are, therefore, obstacles that we must try to face and to remove.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect to this issue concerns the mobility of young researchers. You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme, which is a success, but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers, and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe, so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries. You will see that there are very specific proposals on the issues of mobility in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that my final point, which is the problem of how to put into practice the elements of sustainable development, is included in the policy that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will discuss at Gothenburg. I believe that there is research to be done in these areas, particularly on the specific examples, in order to support the policies of sustainable development. Furthermore, Mr Piétrasanta, you have put forward the idea of having some specific ecosites, for example, in a specific area, which, I believe, is a good example of how sustainable development can be achieved on a local level and I think that creating a network of ecosites is something that is feasible in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I rather sympathise with my colleagues who think that the way in which the new programmes are going to be organised makes it difficult to see what is actually happening. My specific question is this: one of the things on which research is urgently needed is the efficacy of vaccination in outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. I do not know – and I conducted some research into this – what is happening as regards such research within the Framework Programme, either the present one or the one which is planned.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be extremely useful for many people in Europe to know what is being done. I fear very much on the basis of the experience in the United Kingdom that foot-and-mouth disease is not going away and that we may be dealing with it over a long period. European research is therefore absolutely urgent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, moreover, planning to allocate EUR 600 million to this section of the programme. I believe, therefore, that we will then have a greater opportunity to adapt the programmes to new problems. The point that we must stress is that we are able to retain a degree of flexibility and adaptability for urgent situations, which means that we will not be committed today if we adopt a new Framework Programme lasting until 2005, without being able to predict what could happen at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific programmes, therefore, we are presenting what, in our opinion, must be put aside on an annual basis in order to deal with possible urgent and specific programmes.

<p class="contents">My second question concerns the instruments.

Naturally, all these questions would benefit from a lengthy discussion, but I would like to attempt to provide you with some initial answers, in the telegraphic style that we are using today. With regard to the programme for monitoring priorities, this applies as much to the Council as to Parliament because the Framework Programme is subject to the co-decision procedure, and the obvious advantage of having a specific programme covering all the priorities is the single committee, which is a committee that can be sub-divided, if you like, according to different areas of interest. I think that, in the discussion, the problem is not necessarily the number but is rather being able to hold an in-depth debate on a specific number of priorities. I think, therefore, that we can discuss working arrangements and the way the programme will be applied to see how we can deal with this objection.</p>
<p class="contents">To take the problem of new instruments versus old instruments, we have to be clear on this point. We believe that the new Framework Programme must be the cornerstone for the creation of Brussels’ European Research Area. Assessments that have been carried out on previous programmes show that they can be useful, because they enable contacts to be made at European level, but that they do not provide enough structure. This is quite clear and that is why we need new instruments. I understand the concerns felt every time the word ‘new’ is mentioned. It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected. This reaction is, therefore, extremely understandable and I sympathise with some of the concerns, hence the need to explain things carefully. I would, however, like to say that calls for proposals are still applicable in the so-called Category 8, which brings together support for policies with emerging policies. So, over EUR 1.6 billion is available for the calls for proposals in the original meaning of the word. The proposal is, therefore, understood.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the general budget, in my opinion, I think that although it appears to have a degree of approval from the Council, I believe I am right in saying that the Swedish Presidency proposes to hold an initial informal discussion on the budget at the Research Council on 26 June. I hope that our proposal will be adopted. This is a sensible proposal, which is also part of the financial perspectives that were drawn up in Berlin on the various policies of the Commission. I believe, therefore, that this could be done.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point relates to the Joint Research Centre. As you are aware, we have made an effort to focus the tasks of the Joint Research Centre on areas to which it is best suited. In other words, tasks involving joint monitoring, joint tests and scientific expertise in problems relating to the environment, health, some aspects of the nuclear industry and security in terms of the information society. These are useful tools, and, of course, we have a programme for the Joint Research Centre, which, in budgetary terms, is, admittedly, unlikely to increase, but which allows the role of the Joint Research Centre to be more targeted. I believe, therefore, that the Centre will always have a future provided that it is given tasks, which will be of benefit to the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Studies of this type are planned. Some have already been carried out, but you are right to say that issues of prevention do exist. Health risks related to the environment – you will see in the document – are dealt with on the page on the priority entitled ‘Food safety and health risks’.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resources that the European Union is making available for research, I think that I tell everyone that it is essential that we make a greater overall effort. This was the message in the statement on the European Research Area – we are only spending 1.9% of our GNP whereas the United States spend 2.7% and Japan 3.1%. Since the Lisbon and the Stockholm Summits, a considerable number of people have become aware of this, and the Heads of Government often discuss the European Research Area. I was also pleased to read that Mr Jospin spoke of the need for a European Research Area in his speech on the European Union, but said that Member States’ determination was crucial. They must step up their efforts. That is why the issue of benchmarking, which we are implementing, of comparisons between research efforts, and of raising the resources to catalyse this research by creating integrated projects through bringing about the European Research Area, by providing support from the Commission to make national programmes consistent, must create a dynamic to help this research.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, you are quite right to highlight a crucial problem at European level, which is the problem of young researchers. We do not stress often enough that the average age of researchers in Europe is higher than the average age of the European population. This means that there is a problem, that there has not been any recruitment or development of scientific research in our Member States. Generally, there has been a specific problem for the last 20 years and there is currently a need, therefore, to attract young people to careers in research and to develop them in this career. Clearly, in many Member States – and perhaps this is putting it very bluntly – there is something almost scandalous about the status of young researchers in terms of their social and financial standing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, a problem that must be tackled throughout Europe, and I believe that we can provide various comparisons so that all Member States properly address this problem, and I can say that people are becoming aware of this now. Everyone knows that the knowledge-based society is the driving force of the economy of the future. At the Lisbon Summit, it was acknowledged that 25 to 50% of the economy is related to knowledge and therefore to research and innovation. This is a positive aspect that we are indeed attempting to make known as far and wide as possible. The Framework Programme must play a part in increasing awareness of this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a very typical example in my region, namely the cooperation between the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg and the Transuran Institute in Karlsruhe. The question arises: should we not in future bring in a European integration week highlighting good examples, and will integration not also require financial assistance from the European Union, which could be used to support particularly promising joint research ventures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can tell him that, with regard to the large research centres in Europe which do not fall within the competence of the European Union, like CERN in Geneva and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, we have made initial contacts with them. For the first time, we are attempting to establish links between them. They came here to Brussels to meet independently with the Commission, but in doing so created a critical mass. I would like to give the same example of INSERM in France that you give of Heidelberg and of the Cancer Research Centre, as you know that there is an INSERM team from France working at Heidelberg with the German Cancer Research Centre. It is vital that we help to create these national links, through either Article 169 or through supporting cooperation in the national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, your idea of showing this networking in a practical manner is an excellent idea, which perhaps, if I may, I can use to show what already exists and that we must build on this. The Commission’s role will be to enable everyone to take part, depending on their interests in a number of areas, but it is obvious that there are initiatives that have been taken. The dynamic potential of the European Research Area is already being felt in some national institutions that have taken this dynamic spirit to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I understand it, within the first seven categories of research programmes, when health comes in, it is confined to highly scientific biomedical research programmes. When people ask what is happening to public health care research, they are told that it has gone into the all-embracing Category 8, which is rather a jumble sale of a programme with a very small amount of money attached.</p>
<p class="contents">They are told that directorates-general of the Commission are already being invited to submit bids, so it is Agriculture bidding against Environment bidding against Health, and so on. This area of public health looks like missing out, just at the time when the Treaty of Amsterdam is putting it up the agenda for the European Union. Will he have a look at that, because if we are going to get the research programme right, we need to have research into that research programme, and to listen to the people in the field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is the type of discussion that we are going to have. First of all, let me take the content of the priorities. As part of genomics research, it is obvious that there are health policies within this as well. I have already answered Mr Van Velzen with regard to the problem of cancer and the problem of Alzheimer’s disease, which will continue to be investigated. I recently attended a meeting of the leading European cancer specialists. They all know that genomics research represents a potential solution for this disease, as we are advancing towards developing increasingly individually-tailored types of treatment, taking into account aspects of genomics research. This is not theoretical genomics dating back 10 or 15 years – these are elements of application that can be highlighted. One of our objectives is, therefore, to create a network of the leading cancer researchers. There is no contradiction whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, you are right to highlight that public health research, which appears to have less of a genuine scientific dimension, but which focuses instead on epidemiology, should also be carried out. It is true that this has not been planned in Category 8. It is planned in another category that perhaps has not been emphasised enough, namely the cooperation of national programmes. We could, therefore, put ‘co-operate’ on, for example, all epidemiological data. EUR 400 million has been set aside to strengthen the European Research Area. There are several angles of attack. You are quite right to say that we should do everything to help to give the problem a European dimension. These aspects must always be taken into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to take this opportunity to communicate to you the double concern of the scientific community, which is practically unanimous, in relation to two questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the scientific community unreservedly supports the idea of a common area of research. However, on the other hand, it has serious doubts that the effect of synergy and added value at a European level may be lost by means of a concentration of the different research projects; that is to say, the smaller the nucleus, the more concentrated those projects are, the more difficult it is for these synergies to be produced at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question relates to the instruments. The three instruments planned: the networks of excellence, on the one hand, the integrated projects and the recourse to Article 169. The scientific community is concerned about the fact that these three instruments are new and that they are the only ones being used. It fears that others which were being used will be lost despite the fact that the scientific community had become accustomed to them. It also fears that a whole series of research teams which had been created could be lost, all of a sudden, as a result of the exclusive application of these three instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like the Commissioner to respond to this double concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will try to answer it point by point. I think that we must consider the dynamic that we wanted to create, in other words, greater concentration, a European added value in the projects, a dynamic of giving structure to the European Research Area. I have already mentioned this. What, then, is the meaning of the question? It is the fact that there are obstacles to creating this structure, because the proposals are too dispersed. The risks of dispersion will increase with new countries joining the EU and with enlargement. We will then have projects that are too small in size, creating problems that the scientific community has itself seen as well; problems involving deadlines, bureaucracy and the fact that the projects are not sufficiently ambitious. This is the negative aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, find the right balance, with ambitious, more integrated projects, which involve the whole scientific community. These projects are, moreover, more geared towards the scientific community, because they have a European added value and they are projects for the longer term. The networks of excellence, for example, are a long-term venture and they affect the scientific community more than the current system. I am aware of the need to find a balance between the desire to create this European space, the dimension of projects, and the fact that everyone should feel involved. Our task, therefore, is to provide information, to refine things, all the more so because the three instruments are tools for the priority areas, but are not so within the context of the 8th Category, where there are projects which remain linked to the support for the European Union’s policy, and therefore with traditional proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the whole debate that we will hold will actually be to find the right balance between change and a certain conformity, which has posed several problems in managing all the projects. We are managing 14 000 projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say once again that the European Research Area is not simply the European Framework Programme. The European Framework Programme is an aspect of the European Research Area. The European Research Area will also be created through the determination of Member States to increase their collaboration with one another in terms of their research tools. We must, therefore, play a part in this. That is our aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, of course, concerned here with the creation of those values which will ensure prosperity in Europe for many years to come. Unfortunately, responsibility for research lies, in particular, with governments which, in all European countries – almost without exception – have merely been cutting back. Nor am I sure that our Swedish brethren are in any way doing anything to encourage support for the national basic research programmes which generate the new knowledge. If, in the Sixth Framework Programme, we are to achieve a situation in which innovative small companies have access to programmes without their intellectual rights being destroyed, we must have mechanisms which enable companies to have access from outside to the major research programmes and which make it possible for contracts to be concluded without subsequent unnecessary bureaucracy. One fundamental question is therefore the following: has the Council finally got around to giving the research department a mandate to conclude contracts without the need for umpteen signatures? If it has not done so, then your power to act is very limited, Commissioner. It is frustrating for a small enterprise or university department to be obliged, at the diktat of the Council, to wait for heaven knows how many signatures. Have we taken account of this important issue in connection with the restructuring of the Commission's procedures? I am delighted that the Council is there for once, and I am looking forward to hearing the Commission’s answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We certainly think the programme as a whole is going well, but it does need improvement. That is the task we must undertake together. Improvement is needed, for example, in the general approach, which is still too bureaucratic. The components of the programme need to be clarified, and so, in my opinion, does the redistribution of the financial architecture. In my opinion, the extremely urgent, serious, emergency issues relating to human health must certainly be considered priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">When we debate networks and centres of excellence, then, I am sure the Commissioner will also see the need for dialogue with Parliament. As far as our parliamentary committee is concerned, we have an idea for a whole series of centres of excellence to be active in Europe. I therefore believe this continuous relationship can enhance the whole programme and make it possible to find the answers to urgent questions like those raised by Mrs Jackson and Mr Bowis, for example. In other words, we should not be working in our own little sealed compartments. We have put together a European public health programme which can certainly be extremely useful to the Commissioner, and I am sure he has largely taken it into account already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the expression that he used to say the programmes must not be too compartmentalised is the answer but phrased differently, to which I say that we must attempt to avoid excessively strict systems that are too compartmentalised, and therefore take up the broad themes, such as, of course, anything related to neurology, genomics, which are problems that will affect health and which affect various areas, and therefore, we will have greater interaction, create networks of excellence taking into account these various elements – this is the idea behind it. This idea must go forward, however, with, of course, a dialogue between the various scientific communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Members of Parliament are obviously well-placed to bring, first of all, the questions from the scientific communities that I am seeing surface, but also proposals for creating networks of excellence on the themes that are of interest to the European Union and which have an undeniable European added value. This is one of the fundamental criteria. I believe, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, that on 5 June, which is next Tuesday, we have an afternoon of work, during which we will attempt to find practical aspects based on the specific programmes as have been set out, but also based on legitimate questions on the new instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
