<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Commissioner, I wish to begin by expressing my satisfaction at the inclusion of this report in today’s sitting, at the very time that in the buildings of the European Parliament in Brussels, the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries is taking place. This is a good opportunity to discuss this measure, which is designed specifically for these countries, but also to reflect, once again, on the problems affecting them and how these can be overcome, even though we have already considered and adopted a general proposal on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must say straightaway that I profoundly deplore the Council’s decision not to involve the European Parliament in defining and considering this measure. I also deplore the fact that no representative of the Council is here with us today. I think that this is unacceptable behaviour and we hope that it does not set a precedent. Incidentally, since this is a measure designed to cover 49 countries, the vast majority of which are ACP countries, it would be desirable, when defining the measure, to sound out the views of these partners of ours. We should do this even if, or perhaps because the countries for which these measures are mainly intended, measures to exempt them from paying customs duties on products from the least-developed countries, are basically those who are not members of the ACP group.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the measure itself and in general terms, we feel it is a positive step, although its scope is limited. I say limited because, as we all know, exports from these countries represent no more than 0.4% of world trade and 1% of the European Union’s imports. It is also limited because more than 99% of Community trade with these countries already benefits from complete exemption from customs duties. The measure is a positive step, which we would like to be seen as merely the first step in a deeper and more global approach, which we think is crucial, feasible and designed to respond to the countless problems facing the poorest countries in the world. I am not talking only in terms of trade. As a matter of fact, I think that it would be a huge mistake to be so presumptuous as to think that these countries’ problems will all be resolved through measures that are primarily geared towards what is known, sometimes rather simplistically, as “integration into the process of globalisation”. We must take account of the fact that, rather than solving these countries’ problems, this process of liberalisation has ultimately become a genuine problem for them, given that their economies are so weak and that the gap separating them from the industrialised countries is so wide. At the same time, we must not forget that just as important, if not more important than access to the market for these countries is their ability to feed communities that often have no access to the most basic means of subsistence, and this should make our main concern their self-sufficiency, food security and also the survival of their family-based farming structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, still in the field of trade, there are various other aspects we must consider in addition to facilitating the export of the products laid down in this measure. I am talking about the prices of products normally exported by these countries, which are being gradually but constantly knocked down. This also applies to the non-diversification of production and, consequently, to the concentration of exports around a limited range of products, moreover not specialised products, not to mention, for example, the sensitive issue of rules of origin. Basically, although we should give the final version of the agreement as adopted by the Council the broad approval it deserves, for the reasons I have mentioned, it still raises some particular concerns. The first of these specifically concerns the transitional periods that have at last been adopted for sugar, rice and bananas, although we are fully aware of the problems that the issue raises and I do not, therefore, think that this matter should be a source of further controversy. Secondly, I feel that we need to ensure that there is proper supervision of the agreement’s implementation in order to guarantee that the LDCs and their communities really are its final and definitive beneficiaries. We must also ensure that the agreement is not implemented in a way that puts the ACP countries at a disadvantage. In my opinion, an appropriate and broad allocation of quotas for the types of exports covered could improve the effectiveness and discipline of the agreement’s implementation. I shall finish by saying that, in any event, it appears essential to monitor the real impact of implementing this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too am pleased, despite the criticism I have concerning this initiative of the Commission. I feel that granting the least developed countries greater access to our markets is a first step in the right direction. Of course we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would also have liked to be involved in the decision-making process from the outset, instead of having to decide on an objective that ultimately has already been decided. We hope that such matters will be settled differently in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the Committee on Agriculture too welcomes this initiative, although of course it has formulated a whole range of reservations. There is perhaps a legitimate fear that, via triangular operations, more goods – such as sugar for example – could enter the European Union than these countries produce. This can be prevented, however, by giving individual countries a quota for the amount of sugar they can supply. This would be easy to keep track of, and also feasible using present-day methods.</p>
<p class="contents">A fear repeatedly expressed was that goods would now enter the country that do not comply with our health and hygiene regulations. To this I can only say that we already have very clear European Union regulations regarding what food products may be imported into the EU at all. In my opinion – and this brings me to a more personal part – accepting this report was the right thing to do – for the Committee on Agriculture too. But in many respects the attitude adopted by the Committee on Agriculture is too protectionist for my liking.</p>
<p class="contents">One need only look at what a tiny share of European Union trade these countries account for. These countries are dependent on a few products that they can export. It is right for the report to talk about ‘everything but arms’. That is precisely what we supply to these countries and what we are least likely to import from these countries, as they do not produce arms of the quality we require.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we have no need to fear being flooded with goods. I would have wished the Council to adopt the Commission's proposal to stick with the original three-year transitional period. I also feel it is important, however, that we support these countries in producing for their regional markets. In this regard I think it is slightly cynical of the Committee on Agriculture to include the motion that we have to keep an eye on these developing countries to ensure that they are not turning excessively to producing crops for export. Up until now virtually no one has really bothered about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Agriculture I also saw motions to delete altogether the sentence stating that we welcome this initiative. I think this is regrettable, especially when one considers that the European Union represents a community based on solidarity that operates with large transfers of funds. Why then should we not give the poorest people in this world a certain transfer too? As I said before, I would have liked the Committee on Agriculture to take a much less protectionist stance. But there I shall leave it for the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And precisely for that reason I believe it is worth putting the debate in context by reminding ourselves that the world of the 49 least developed countries at which the measure we are concerned with is aimed is a world where life expectancy barely exceeds 50 years, where 10% of infants die before their first birthday, where 50% of children under five suffer from malnutrition, and where the average per capita GDP is little more than EUR 282 per year. These are figures that still shock us even though are they well known.</p>
<p class="contents">They shock us, first of all, because these figures are not just abstract statistics but speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, and because we know that every figure reflects real conditions which affect people who are also real. People who have the same rights and the same dignity as we have, who see poverty and underdevelopment looming over them for the simple reason that they were born where they were born. Secondly, these figures shock us because, despite the aid and development policies that the European Union and the Member States carry out to fight poverty and underdevelopment throughout the world, not only are the figures not coming down but the abyss separating the rich countries from the poor countries is growing ever deeper.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, changing the reality reflected by these figures means we must not just sit back in resignation but must enter the field of action and practical measures. Thus on behalf of my Group I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative. This initiative is a good step in the right direction, although to optimise the results that may come of it additional measures should be taken in additional fields. That is precisely why I regret the fact that the Council, under pressure from certain Member States which I prefer not to name, has introduced longer transitional periods, as has already been reported, which may lessen and in any case delay the impact of this initiative on these countries’ economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the points in the draft resolution of the report we are discussing which were highlighted by the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which show a desire either to protect the interests of the Member States or to safeguard the advantages of the ACP countries. Both these interests and these advantages may be legitimate. But in no case, in the Christian Democrat view, should they prevail over the duty of the European Union to foster lasting economic and social development in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, as the Treaty stipulates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we think Commissioner Lamy’s ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, which should allow the least developed countries to place their products on European Union markets with no quantitative or tariff restrictions, is a positive measure. In this overall evaluation we agree both with Joaquim Miranda and his report, which was approved by our Committee on Development and Cooperation, and with the concerns and criticisms that the rapporteur expresses with regard to the proposed amendments to the Regulation that we are discussing here.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel it is unnecessary, mean and even pathetic that for products like sugar, rice and bananas the proposed opening-up will not be fully effective until 2009. The reasons that have led to this cautious measure do not seem justified to us. Other machinery could have been set up to protect Community production of these foodstuffs without diminishing the value of the initiative we are debating through this move.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the proposal made by Mr Miranda that this whole question should be discussed with our partners, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, within the context of the Cotonou Agreement, is also pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">This ‘Everything but arms’ programme is essentially a political gesture, the essential value of which lies in the European Union’s show of solidarity towards those who are most in need within the developing world. As a gesture, it is of interest and important, but there is no reason to exaggerate its consequences – which some have defined as a threat to certain sectors in the European Union – or to exaggerate its positive effects, which are certainly very limited, on the economies of the actual countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though this is all it may be, what should be stressed is that it is a little step in the right direction. Perhaps the most debatable point is the discrimination it makes among developing countries between least developed and slightly more developed ones; this is an arbitrary division and therefore one that introduces injustice, something that in the medium term we should overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall mention a detail that we believe is indispensable and which is already hinted at in the regulation to which this initiative refers. It is the need to establish strict controls to prevent fraud, whereby the produce of other countries, even highly-developed ones, might reach Europe via countries that are beneficiaries of these measures in order to benefit from the new conditions established here. This really could become dangerous, and it would also be cheating the generous intentions behind the measure, which if defrauded would turn against the interests of those whom we are trying to help today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, having been through the Council’s mangle, it undeniably looks less impressive. Industry has lobbied well, in the sense that it has succeeded in convincing certain Member States that the EU system will collapse if developing countries are given the opportunity to export just a little bit more sugar and rice than they do at present. I will not even go into the subject of bananas. Despite the fact that the EU countries like to use fine words about being advocates of the free market, protectors of the developing countries and a region with responsibility in the world and with high social ideals, etc. etc., it is apparent that these kinds of words can generally only be used on special occasions. There is occasionally something of a gap between words and action and, if there is one thing that the developing countries need, then it is action.</p>
<p class="contents">As other speakers have mentioned, there is a kind of tragi-comic situation in the fact that the opportunities of the least developed and poorest nations are being discussed in Brussels right now whilst we are simultaneously having the same debate. It is to be feared that, in both places, the discussion will end once again with a lot of words and, in reality, very little action. But OK, it is a small step in the right direction, and so we can only wish the Commission luck with the new proposal and the new communication on sustainability which also, after all, mentions agriculture. We must therefore hope that the Commission has the necessary strength to settle matters with the agricultural organisations in the various countries. In any event, it is absolutely necessary for us to get to grips with the problems associated with the poorest countries, the number of which has, after all, grown from 25 to 49 over the past 30 years, with only one country disappearing from the list. The developing countries need free trade, debt rescheduling and aid, both technical and economic, and all three are needed urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the detail, as has been said, about 99% of LDC exports already enter EU markets duty free. The problem is not so much about access as about supply-side constraints, about issues concerning infrastructure, education and training. Agriculture is the key area where LDCs do not currently have access, yet it is precisely the area in which we see delays in relation to sugar, rice and bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">Others have raised legitimate concerns about food security in poorer countries. Rather than using their land for ever-increasing exports of agricultural commodities to the north, there are important questions to be asked about feeding their own populations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to raise the question of the general principle behind this initiative. When I was at the ACP meeting in Gabon earlier this year, Commissioner Nielson praised the initiative by saying that it was a great sign of progress that poor countries are now being thrust into competition with each other. To me that is not a sign of progress, but a sign of madness. If the poorer countries compete with each other on small numbers of commodities that can only bring down international prices, with the winners being those in the north, not those in the south.</p>
<p class="contents">Markets in the north are not, sadly, infinite. We are already seeing how the EBA risks undermining the Cotonou Agreement and how the preferential access that has already been guaranteed to ACP countries is now coming under threat. In some senses the EU is being accused of taking from the poor to help the poorest.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am concerned that open markets and global integration are becoming a substitute for development policies. We need to think more imaginatively about supporting poorer countries in their own regional development strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this initiative begins to have a real effect in the near future, bringing about a qualitative and effective improvement in the quality of the living conditions of the people concerned, then, yes, it will be a world first. Even so, if I may, I would firstly like to ask about the timing of this initiative, which is scheduled a few months prior to the re-launch of the WTO negotiations. It would be regrettable if this proposal were used primarily to attempt to bring round all the developing countries to the European position at the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to look at the content of this initiative. Europe imports six times the amount of agricultural products from LDCs than the United States, yet this only represents 1% of all the European Union’s exports. This shows the magnitude of the effort that rich countries must make in order to attempt to restore some balance within the world trade system, which more than works in their favour. Several aspects of this initiative give me cause for concern, however. First of all, the lack of consultation with either Parliament or the ACP countries, which are stressing, as they did at the Joint Assembly, that the preferential system for sugar, for example, as well as all the Community protocols, could be compromised. Also, the need to reclassify impact studies in order to improve understanding and take into account the legitimate concerns expressed with regard to the potential negative effects. Then, products destined for industrialised countries should benefit from access to minimum guaranteed prices and should be protected from fluctuations in exchange rates, whereas the economies of the LDCs are all too often dependent on the international environment and on the exports of one or two basic products. Lastly, diversifying production must be actively encouraged, all the more so because, as confirmed by experts at the United Nations, production capabilities were weakened in the last decade and some industries died out due to competition from imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The French High Council for International Cooperation stresses, for example, that the right of the LDCs to protect and to support their fragile industry, particularly in terms of their food safety, must be recognised. Now, in order to guarantee this sovereignty of food, to make considerable progress in meeting the people’s most pressing needs and to have access to technology, the LDCs are in dangerous and vital need of substantial external funding, and for this to be provided in a spirit of cooperation which will help develop their production capacity. If we can give them help by opening up our markets to their products, the liberalisation of trade cannot be seen as a development policy. How, indeed, can essential needs be met when the growing burden of debt continues to condemn every attempt made by these countries to invest in a future? In 1970, this debt was equal to 10% of the developing countries’ GNP, and now it represents more than 40% of their GNP, whereas the total amount of public money given is less than that paid in interest on the debt. France had, in fact, made a commitment at the second Conference on LDCs to give 0.20% of its GNP, but in 1999, only 0.08% was actually given. I cannot stress enough the gravity of the situation behind these figures half of the population lives on less than EUR 2 per day, one in three does not have access to electricity, one child in three suffers from malnutrition. The time has come, therefore, to listen…</p>

The Commission’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative is therefore commendable. However, for the least developed countries, market access is not sufficient. They lack the infrastructure to capitalise on market access. Furthermore, the transitional periods for rice, sugar and bananas are long, and after these, a safeguard measure can be used at will. Additionally, the EU’s product requirements are high.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to turn the initiative into a real success, it is important to help the least developed countries gain market access. Technical assistance is required if the requirements which European consumers prescribe in terms of their food are to be met. Only then can food safety be taken as a guiding principle. Otherwise, the European market will retain its protectionist character.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphatically support the rapporteur’s call for a study of the actual implications of the initiative. In the past, the indigenous people of the least developed countries rarely benefited from the opening up of markets. The evaluation of the Lomé agreements in the 90s made that abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Miranda report contains a few contradictions. The text of our resolution has the feel of a compromise. The European farmers, the ACP group, the consumers, they all seem to be gaining from it. Although I understand the positions of all parties in and outside the European Union, I still believe that we need to make a choice. Either we choose to improve the situation of 600 million people in the least developed countries, or we do not.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would urge the Commission also to involve the US and Japan in the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative at the LDC Conference, which is currently being held in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy has been accused of many things in bringing this forward: of a cynical attempt to buy votes in the WTO; of seducing developing countries into untrammelled free trade; of seeking to divide the solidarity of the ACP countries; of robbing the poor to pay the poorest. Each of these criticisms has some validity and we need to keep them at the front of our concerns as we take this issue forward. But Mr Lamy should be congratulated, after years of inaction, for helping us take a huge step towards bringing down agricultural protectionism which – according to the United Nations – robs developing countries of some USD 100 billion a year, more than twice the amount of international aid flows.</p>
<p class="contents">In his reply, let me ask the Commissioner to address some important questions. When Ingo Feustal of DG Trade told our Committee on Development and Cooperation on 6 March that Cotonou consultation procedures had been followed and joint impact assessments would be produced, the Commissioner should honestly accept tonight that Declaration XXIII of the Cotonou Agreement, requiring a joint-ministerial trade committee recommendation, was not observed and that no such assessments have yet been produced. Mr Lamy should commit the EU to providing the aid required by the LDCs to exploit the new opportunities and by other ACP countries to achieve transition. He should recognise that the EU is currently badly failing to fulfil its promise to the rum-producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy should guarantee that administrative arrangements will prevent hygiene rules being used as a disguised form of protectionism and, at the same time, apply rules of origin which prevent fraud but enable LDCs to add value to their raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Lamy and I both come from sugar-producing regions. Like him I strongly resisted those who sought to scare our farmers and industry with wholly misleading claims about the consequences of the proposal. We all know they are dwarfed in reality by the impact of the sugar protocol within the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overprotection of our markets is at the expense of the poor, and particularly the poorest, countries. That is why my group too applauds the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative. However, free market access will not automatically lead to a higher level of exports from the least developed countries. For that to happen, supply, above all, will need to become better, more diverse and more competitive. Also, exports should not be at the expense of the local market. The current initiative will not be able to substantially improve the economic situation in the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, what does free access mean without the means or the expertise to raise industry to Western standards? What does this fine initiative mean if it does not apply to sugar, bananas and rice for the time being? Precisely those products which many countries can offer competitively. Europe must help the least developed countries to cope with globalisation. For that reason, all walls will need to be taken down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything but arms – but bananas, sugar and rice too, or, in other words, sensitive sectors for European countries but staple sectors for the LDCs. Furthermore, 40 of the 48 LDCs were already reaping the benefits of these preferences in the framework of the Lomé trade system. Therefore, their situation will not change in the slightest because of this measure. On the other hand, however, it is the non-LDCs that will feel the change, with the end of non-reciprocal trade preferences under the Cotonou Agreement and the creation of free trade areas by 2008. This measure will actually stimulate competition between the LDCs and non-LDCs, even within the same ACP group, which has not even been consulted. We are still taking the approach that only liberalisation and competition can lead to development. In return, as has already been mentioned, Mr Lamy is obviously expecting support from the LDCs at the negotiations in Qatar and, more broadly speaking, expecting them to join the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">On the face of it, these proposals appear to be favourable, but they risk confining the LDCs to the role of exporters of raw materials, at the expense even of the food requirements of their own populations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Opening up our markets to the poorest countries, and this time, fully opening up our markets, has, overall, been well received, although it is undeniable and to be expected that this proposal should have given rise to some concern and some criticism, both in this House and in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore try to give very brief answers on the various issues that have been raised, starting with the impact of this proposal, which, we are occasionally told, would pave the way for a massive influx of agricultural products from the LDCs onto the EU’s market; your report itself puts into perspective the concessions made in terms of volume.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true as you have said that these countries account for only 0.4% of total world trade and 1% of EU imports. These figures are unlikely to increase in a sudden and spectacular manner, especially when the export capabilities of these countries are taken into account. We are, however, committed to increasing these capabilities, particularly by imposing health standards, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler mentioned, but also and more generally by improving infrastructures. We, and by ‘we’ I mean the Commission, Poul Nielson and myself, do not, therefore, see this as a substitute for aid, and here I am replying directly to the point made by Mrs Lucas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the deadlines, it is true that the Commission has re-examined its original proposal in light of the discussions held on the impact of this proposal. It is correct to say that we changed the schedule to bring about a gradual opening of the market, but over time to open it completely, for bananas, sugar and rice. It was on this basis that the Council gave its final opinion. Some regret these concessions. I myself would probably have preferred not to give concessions, but our common law is that of qualified majority and we had to achieve a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">As for respecting the Cotonou Agreements, I would like to reiterate that the ACP ministers welcomed this proposal last December, and that they stressed the need to respect this agreement, which is what we have done. The Commission consulted Mrs Boudjenah and Mr Rod as well as the ACP countries on its proposal, and is currently in consultation with the ACP countries on the provisions needed to maintain the competitiveness of these countries, in accordance with Declaration XXIII, which Mr Howitt quite rightly quoted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the desire expressed by some of you to make more progress, the report clearly demonstrates that universal agreement has not been reached on either the timetable or the resources. We are taking a step in the right direction and we are endeavouring to make our actions match our words. Let us begin by implementing this proposal and let us encourage other trading partners, as Mr Belder proposed, to move in this direction as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the rapporteur’s point of view on consultation with Parliament. This was a decision that would have been submitted to the codecision procedure if the Commission and Parliament proposals at the Intergovernmental Conference on reform of Article 133 had been accepted by the Member States. We know now that this did not happen and that we are, therefore, bound by the rules of the Treaty, which, on the issue of Parliament’s involvement, unfortunately remains unchanged. We have, therefore, worked and, in accordance with the commitments I undertook when I entered office, I personally have worked directly with the various competent parliamentary committees, with the Committee on Development and Cooperation in January, with the Committee on Agriculture at the end of January and with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in February, and I fully intend to continue doing so, unfortunately with the inadequate Treaty texts, which involves working on all the important paragraphs of our trade policy with the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report represents a valuable contribution to our efforts to avoid the LDCs becoming marginalised in a trading system that is becoming increasingly global. The discussion that we are holding today is, nonetheless, welcome, as Mrs Ferrer said, given the UN Conference currently taking place in Brussels. I believe that this report confirms the breadth of consensus between our two institutions on our main goals for managing the multilateral trade regime. As Mr Martínez Martínez said, this is a small step rather than a great leap forwards, but it is undeniably a politically important step, no more, no less. It is now up to us to work resolutely towards putting this into practice. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
