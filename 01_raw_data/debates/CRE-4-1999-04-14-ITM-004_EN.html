<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, since Kosovo is daily and nightly on our minds, I do not mind being taken by surprise in having to make some introductory remarks, bearing in mind that this morning the German presidency and the President of the Commission also devoted time to this very important issue. I am sure it goes for both the Council and the Commission when I say that we are very much aware of the seriousness of the situation, of the human tragedy that is developing, and that nothing must hinder us from examining and thinking continuously how to bring this appalling situation to a politically satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously that is not an easy thing to do. We should be pleased that the Western Alliance, including the European Union – and Russia to a large extent – have managed to maintain a common attitude towards what is seen as a barbarism which should no longer belong on our continent. It is therefore of the utmost importance that this Union is preserved. The Commission, for its part, has supported the presidency in every effort and initiative, trying to show that while it is not our opinion that military solutions should be used to resolve this tragedy, they are at least preventing President Milosevic from imposing a military solution and exploiting his military might against the Albanians in Kosovo. That will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past weeks the German presidency has been working very hard with the other European, American and Russian partners to try to see how the military track on the one hand could be accompanied by political initiatives on the other. The House will be aware that there was an important meeting in Oslo yesterday between Secretary‐of‐State Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov, in an attempt to reach an agreement on a plan that is also being discussed today by our Heads of Government with the Secretary‐General of the United Nations. This provides for an attempt to achieve unity on a Security Council resolution which would make clear to Mr Milosevic that what is expected from him in the first place is to take measures to allow the safe return of refugees – we should perhaps speak of deportees – to Kosovo. This would be achieved by him withdrawing his troops and paramilitary services, to give the necessary guarantees for the security of these people, based on his acceptance of an international military presence on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bonino and I have been trying to give active support to those countries which neighbour Kosovo and which are the most heavily affected by the massive influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Therefore, we were very pleased to note the concerted support from the Council of Foreign Ministers who on Monday pledged EUR 250m to those countries. EUR 150m would come from ECHO, to be spent mostly as usual through non‐governmental organisations where obviously UNHCR plays an important role. The other EUR 100m would enable the governments which are mainly dealing with the refugee problem to take certain measures to prevent destabilisation in their countries as a result of this unexpected massive influx. We are thinking of Albania in the first place but also of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and we are also trying to reach those in Montenegro who are dealing with the massive influx of tens of thousands of displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will be able to present final proposals to Parliament soon. I have already been in touch with the chairman of the Committee on Budgets to try to arrange for the allocation of 100 million, which has to be found in the budget without damaging other important on‐going programmes that, in fact, often benefit the same countries that we want to help with the additional EUR 100m.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not be the last time that we discuss this issue: it is an on‐going process. I can only conclude my introductory remarks by saying that we all hope very much that Milosevic will come to his senses. It is not the outside world that is imposing a military solution on him, it is the outside world that is heavily and, we feel convincingly, protesting against the atrocities, the ethnic cleansing and the deportations that are taking place against the people of Kosovo. Where we can alleviate their plight, we will spare no effort. As Mrs Bonino is here, I take it that she will comment more particularly on the humanitarian efforts. These are my introductory remarks.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what Chancellor Schröder has already said today as President‐in‐Office of the European Council, I would like to stress that in the current serious crisis in and around Kosovo the European Union has demonstrated a high level of solidarity and ability to act. It has shown solidarity in terms of its political evaluation of what is happening there – which, as you all know, has not always been the case – and an ability to act in relation to the aid that has to be provided for the people concerned, to the stabilisation measures that must be taken for the countries in the region and to consolidating the principle of the primacy of politics over war. After all, when weapons speak we must not simply put politics to one side; instead we must always continue to pursue the road of politics. We must be clear that political initiatives can contribute to putting an end to the use of arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bonino and I were in Tirana and in Skopje exactly two weeks ago. Mrs Bonino will no doubt be reporting on that later. I just want to say that for both of us this journey was something totally outside the normal political routine. I for my part – and I am quite sure this goes for Mrs Bonino too – was shaken to the core by what I witnessed there, and I have seen many such things in the past – the victims of torture in South Africa, the victims of famine in Somalia, the victims of expulsion in Africa – but I have never seen such a massive, such a brutal, such a systematic violation of human rights as there, and this is happening in the middle of Europe, on our doorstep! So I believe it is essential that we adhere to the aim of putting a stop to this inhuman action. It can no longer be tolerated in Europe at the end of this century!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have to exercise our political imagination to seek a solution to the problem. The German Presidency is putting all its energy into endeavouring to do so at this time. I am very happy to be able to tell you that broad international agreement is emerging on a process that looks something like this: the Yugoslav Government will be offered a 24‐hour ceasefire as soon as it begins to withdraw its troops and paramilitary units. That ceasefire will be extended if this withdrawal continues; and once the withdrawal is complete and the other conditions have been met, we can begin to implement a peace settlement, one that is still on the basis of what was negotiated in Rambouillet.</p>
<p class="contents">But that only answers the immediate question of what we will do when the shooting stops. The longer‐term question is this: how can we develop a policy that guarantees stability and peace for the entire region in the long term? Here we have put forward for discussion the idea of a stability pact for the entire region. This must certainly be looked at as a medium and long‐term process, at the end of which we do not envisage a new order in the sense of re‐drawing borders or even persuading people to leave their home; at the end of it we want to see a political strategy that enables the peoples of the region to cooperate and to co‐exist peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present situation it is crucial that the European Union and the international community leave no doubt about their resolve. That is why we must adhere to the conditions we set for ending the military action. These conditions are such that Milosevic can quite easily fulfil them. It is up to him and him alone to ensure that his country is not destroyed even further and that the lives of the people of his country are not put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also state again quite firmly: the international community is not at war with Serbia or with the Serbian people. It is not a question of gaining territory, ruling over people, obtaining spheres of influence. Nor is it a question of raw materials or oil or anything of the kind; it is a matter of fundamental human rights and nothing else! It is a matter of ensuring that the declaration of human rights is not a hollow phrase in Europe but that ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in you interrupting because I do not understand you. I do not understand your language. There is no point. I do not understand it!</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of making it clear that we are also prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of our common convictions and to most resolutely oppose the activities of those who are trying by criminal means to destroy all the progress we have achieved in European civilisation!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, yesterday was Holocaust Day in Israel. That anniversary is a stark reminder of our commitment to the principle of ‘never again!", which was the founding principle of the European Union. We must never again turn a blind eye to genocide, we must never again tolerate ethnic cleansing, we must never again appease a brutal dictatorship. The message has to go from this Chamber and from the international community that the Milosevic campaign of ethnic hatred, which began ten years ago, must end where it began – in Kosovo! We must say to him that on the verge of the next millennium he cannot use events which took place in 1389 to justify mass murder today. We will not let him drag us back to the barbarity of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the German presidency on the firmness of its resolve and leadership in this conflict. We all know the immense difficulties this has presented for Germany, and I recognise and pay tribute to the courage of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister in particular. I also congratulate the Commission on the speed of its response to the humanitarian crisis, despite the difficulties it is having to face at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has consistently argued that military action was a last resort because of the very dangers of military action which we are seeing at the moment. However, once every possible opportunity for negotiation was exhausted – and every possible opportunity was exhausted – then military action was inevitable and should be supported by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">That military action must continue until Kosovar Albanians are able to return to their homes in peace. We must not give Milosevic any sort of victory or allow him to play any more games with the international community. We must increase our resolve to deal with the displaced people. They are not refugees: they have been driven from their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also learn our lessons from these events. It is quite clear that we need to have a European defence identity and, therefore, the St Malo initiative must be followed up rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally clear that Europe does not have the resources for a European defence identity: we cannot mount a campaign without American and NATO support. So if we really believe in peace‐making and peace‐keeping, Member States must be prepared to have a defence budget commensurate with our ambitions. It is not enough to talk! We have to put our money where our mouths are!</p>
<p class="contents">The final lesson we must learn: a lot of attention is focused on the importance of Russia and America. This whole tragedy has underlined the importance of one other country in Europe, and that is Turkey. Turkey is clearly crucial to the peace and stability of this continent. It is beholden on the European Union to take seriously its responsibilities for Turkey and ensure that Turkey feels part of the European family.</p>

<p class="contents">The warmongers will continue to shadow‐box to ensure the effectiveness of aerial attacks, which have been going on with catastrophic ferocity for three weeks. Ordinary people, however, are questioning the major role once again given to the Americans by Europe through NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that entire decades passed before Mr McNamara acknowledged that the massive intervention in Vietnam was a criminal error. Nor should we forget that, more recently, just as Mr Milosevic is now being called ‘the butcher of Kosovo", Saddam Hussein was called ‘the butcher of Baghdad". Despite the massive operation in the Gulf, he is still alive and continues to rule, whilst children in Iraq are dying of hunger and disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the standoffs and dramas have reached a climax, there is no room for dispassionate responses. There is, however, grave concern about the disastrous dangerous consequences that the failure to come up with a political solution might have. There is concern that the whole of the Balkans risks becoming destabilised if ground operations are initiated, and unless the inviolability of existing borders is guaranteed. There is concern about a resurgence of cold war tensions and about the fact that the role of the United Nations as the guardian of peace and international legitimacy is in danger of being undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let us hope that this afternoon the Brussels Council will assume its real responsibilities, albeit belatedly, and that it will safeguard not the credibility of NATO, but peace in Europe and cooperation among all its peoples.</p>

On his frequent visits to European capitals and to Brussels, Mr Rugova told us several times, and with growing anguish, that a tragedy was unfolding in Kosovo and that Milosevic's violence would push the Kosovar population, and especially its young people, to armed struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately we did not take heed of those dire warnings. Perhaps we wanted to, but we did not succeed. The time required to reach intergovernmental agreements – the UN is a case in point but so are European mechanisms – is very long, which means that our decisions are dictated by procedures instead of by the true necessities of history and by the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO's intervention was long overdue and I congratulate our colleagues from the EPP Group for clearly rejecting this statement, which I cannot imagine represents the opinion of our colleagues. NATO's intervention did not cause ethnic cleansing. It simply revealed its extent. It did not provoke Mr Milosevic. It has simply shown that Milosevic is a war criminal.</p>
<p class="contents">We respect the voices of those who would honestly not like to see weapons used. We respect the voice of Catholic leaders such as the Pope; but if we do not use force against Milosevic, violence will continue and spread. We need a union of minds and determination. This is the reason why the ELDR Group would have preferred the European Parliament to have considered the utilisation of ground troops if needed. For the rest, we fully agree with the joint statement and with what Chancellor Schroeder said this morning.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pasty</span> <span class="bold"> (UPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Kosovo, which is completely dominating European current affairs, to the extent that it makes the other subjects being debated seem absurd, should be looked at from three points of view: the military aspect, the humanitarian aspect and the political and diplomatic aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The political and diplomatic failure of the Rambouillet Conference, which did not succeed in obtaining the agreement of all the parties in the conflict, unfortunately reversed the order of priorities, and it is now the outcome of the military phase that will dictate what will happen next. This outcome obviously depends solely on the behaviour of Slobodan Milosevic, who should not for one moment be in any doubt as to the determination of the NATO allies; they will only put an end to military action when the safety of all the inhabitants of Kosovo is guaranteed within the borders of the Federation of Yugoslavia, and when all the refugees, who are victims of ethnic cleansing, can return to their country. This non‐negotiable demand has just been pointed out in a most timely manner by the United Nations Secretary‐General, Kofi Annan. It is supported by the large majority of public opinion in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">By blindly refusing to face this reality, the dictator, a former Yugoslav communist, is adopting a suicidal attitude with regard to both himself and the entire Serbian population, whose sincere patriotism, which commands respect, is being abused. While continuing their military pressure, NATO and the allies have to deal with an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The flood of refugees is overwhelming the capacity of Kosovo"s neighbouring countries to accept them, and threatens to politically destabilise them. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is entangled in its own bureaucracy and perhaps paralysed by its inability to quickly mobilise the necessary resources, has proved to be inadequate, but the mobilisation of NGOs and the International Red Cross has been entirely remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the immense scale and the urgency of need, it is essential that humanitarian intervention is coordinated. It seems that the issue of accepting the most vulnerable refugees – women, children and the sick – in Europe and across the Atlantic, is being dealt with in a much calmer manner than was initially the case. This should not of course be interpreted as a de facto acceptance of the ethnic cleansing that Slobodan Milosevic has planned for Kosovo, but it is undoubtedly necessary in order to relieve the pressure on Albania, as it is obvious that the completely safe return of those who have been expelled from Kosovo cannot take place immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The definitive end to the crisis has to come through a political and diplomatic solution. Russia appears to be an essential partner in seeking this lasting solution to the crisis in Kosovo. It has already made considerable diplomatic efforts to make the Yugoslav dictator listen to reason, and will have an essential role to play in negotiating and guaranteeing peace, particularly by participating in a peace‐keeping force which will act under a United Nations mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, to whom the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize a few months ago, has an essential role to play. In order to ensure that he is not used as a tool by the Yugoslav dictator – who is currently holding him hostage – we must demand that he regain his freedom of movement so that he can meet with the authorities directly affected by the conflict, and Parliament should take the initiative to invite him to come and speak to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the European Union, which has been unable to prevent conflict, either in Kosovo or in Bosnia – despite the fact that these conflicts were clearly predictable – should draw all the lessons that it can from these failures, and should finally provide itself with a truly credible common foreign and security policy. While the European Union has enabled the enemies of the past to be reconciled, in the future it should serve as a model for the Balkans and we should affirm loud and clear that there is plenty of room for a democratic and peaceful Serbia, which includes Kosovo, in a united Europe. This is the message of hope that we must convey to our Serbian friends, who are currently being abused by a shameless dictator who is leading their nation towards a collective suicide, and not towards the glorious destiny with which he has dazzled them in order to serve his personal criminal ambitions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wurtz </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, in my view it is right and also encouraging that Europeans are mobilising in their millions in response to the humanitarian tragedy that has been forced on the Kosovars.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must bring aid to the refugees, offer asylum to those who request it, affirm their right to return, work to reestablish them and ensure their safety by means of a European peace‐keeping force. We must also demand substantial autonomy for Kosovo and convene a European conference for peace, security and reconstruction in the Balkans. These are our proposals, some of which date back a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express here today my complete condemnation of Milosevic"s policy. I think that the ethnic cleansing and the forced exodus of the people is an abomination and a crime. Whether the Serbs are the perpetrators, as in Bosnia in the past and now in Kosovo, or whether they are the victims, as in the recent case of the people of Krajina in Croatia, I am among those who believe that sovereignty is a very important element in international relations, but that it does not mean that a power can do absolutely anything to its people or to a minority.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not what we disagree on. The source of our disagreement lies in making war the habitual means of resolving problems, with no regard for the severe humanitarian, material and political consequences. It lies in the refusal to see that the bombing has entirely the opposite effect to the objectives that were officially laid down for it. It lies in the acceptance of the dubious and irresponsible game that some western countries are playing with the KLA. It lies in the rejection of the UN and the cavalier exclusion of partners such as Russia, all of which we can now see are essential for ending this crisis. All these strategical errors bear a mark, the mark of NATO and the American leaders, on the eve of the Washington summit that is aimed at fixing their hegemony over Europe in the post cold war period.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am convinced that Europe has allowed itself to be caught up in this affair, and that it is in its interests to do everything possible to free itself from this tragic deadlock. In this respect, I am following the current European diplomatic initiatives with a great deal of interest and attention.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the way forward. We should be aware that all of the organisations in Yugoslavian civil society that are fighting courageously for human rights, for autonomy for Kosovo and against the power of Milosevic, have recently launched a joint appeal which says that NATO"s military intervention has undermined all the results that they had achieved and has endangered the very survival of civil society in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be capable of listening to the voices that are being raised, from the Christian Democrat vice‐president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE to Monsignor Botazzi, from Helmut Schmidt to Mario Soares, from top political leaders in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Italy and France, to many figures from European progressive movements, calling for the bombing to be stopped and for a full‐scale political battle to be undertaken in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace at the heart of our continent.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, in times of war, the dominant reality is one of fronts, organised and maintained as coherent blocs. Any dissonant noises are treachery and have to be silenced. The room for debate contracts, and in wartime too, the absence of debate is very dangerous. We should not delude ourselves that all the valid and humane arguments are contained in a single analysis and a single approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Who can claim here that the NATO raids, without a mandate from the UN, do not give rise to problems as far as international law and international relations are concerned? Who can say that shutting out the UN here does not create a vacuum, because the UN has not given the green light to action but nor has it condemned the raids? Often in a vacuum of this kind, nothing happens for a long time or another factor intervenes, in this case NATO, with both humanitarian and military strategy objectives. I recommend that everyone should read Mr Brzezinski in today"s <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</span> , who sets out these ideas very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Who can be sure that the criminal treatment meted out to the Kosovo population, which started long before the NATO bombings of course, will suddenly and miraculously stop? But who can deny that the raids have dramatically increased the persecution and deportation of the Kosovars? Above all, who can forget that the scale of this mass exodus and expulsion has been totally underestimated and that the measures to cope with the refugees have been badly organised? Who can fail to see that if the destructive bombing continues, this will in the long term affect not only the regime but also and primarily the population and their day‐to‐day living conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">But most important of all is what we should do now, namely concentrate on political initiatives. We must move away from military targets and look to political objectives. The Greens are therefore happy that the German Presidency and Joschka Fischer are working so hard to secure a peace plan. It is our firm conviction that a lasting political solution cannot be found without involving the UN and Russia. We believe that the Council must create the conditions in which a limited halt to the bombing can open the way to preparation of a cease‐fire, naturally with conditions attached, conditions which Kofi Annan has indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am eternally grateful to Europe"s citizens for their generous readiness to take in Kosovar refugees. Their decision, born of high moral standards, is a clear signal to their government leaders that the EU governments should emulate those same standards, rather than falling woefully short of them.</p>

That was not the case a month ago. Finally, following developments that have taken place, we are facing up to the situation and we are not, as Mrs Alvoet said, pretending not to see that the problem with the UN was not created by Kosovo and that it existed before that situation arose. We are aware of the power of veto within the Security Council, and we know that some countries are constantly using it in order to block any initiative on the part of the international community. There was no alternative, Mrs Alvoet, to NATO intervention. I agree that it is unfortunate, but that is how it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Pasty that I find him very optimistic. To say that Mr Milosevic is suicidal is to give him too much credit and it is a refusal to understand that his policy is a scientific one, which he is continuing to carry out and for which is entirely responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of doubts and am very sceptical about the German plan. It will be used by Mr Milosevic to gradually withdraw his troops as far as he pleases, resulting in a situation that we have been rejecting since August: the partitioning of Kosovo. It will be a partitioning in which he will be the winner, and which will enable him to annex 40 % or 50 % of Kosovan territory, where there happen to be a few monasteries, but more importantly where there are much richer areas, such as mines. He will annex this section, and from that moment on he will refuse to withdraw, and the international community, tired from long weeks of intervention, will sign up to Milosevic"s victory, as it did at Dayton. Just as he was given 50 % of Bosnian territory at Dayton, this will give him 50 % of Kosovan territory, obviously completely cleared of any Kosovar presence.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the danger that we are facing. I think that it should be very much on our minds. We are aware of Mr Milosevic"s intellectual and criminal resources. We know that he is capable of anything. He has proved this once again. There was no need for him to prove it again for me, but I think that it was necessary for some of my colleagues in order to make them finally open their eyes. I think that we should continue to keep our eyes wide open and, while we are waiting, work to ensure that he is found guilty before the Tribunal in The Hague, because he has long ceased to be a person with whom political negotiations are possible. It is high time that the international community realised that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Souchet </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, NATO has launched, on its own authority and bypassing the United Nations, military action aimed at putting an end to an unacceptable policy of ethnic cleansing. What we are now seeing is that this action has undoubtedly contributed to accelerating and magnifying the ethnic cleansing. We are seeing that the initial strikes, which according to Mr Vedrine and Mr Cook were only to last a few days, have rapidly become a full‐scale war against a European nation whose economic infrastructure we are systematically seeking to destroy, and whose civilian population is inevitably being bombed. Meanwhile, we have no idea where this escalating situation should lead if the Yugoslav authorities do not give in to force.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial objective that was given for the bombing was to obtain by force what we had felt we were unable to achieve through negotiation: the implementation of the Rambouillet plan, a substantial degree of autonomy for Kosovo, with respect for Yugoslav sovereignty and monitored by a substantial NATO force. The antagonism between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians has now reached a level where it is almost beyond remedy, which means that the future coexistence of these people within the framework set out in the Rambouillet plan no longer seems to be a realistic prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of these shifts and this deadlock, we all now feel that there is no solution to the escalating military situation and that we should not listen to the irresponsible warmongers who are calling for a ground operation and/or the arming of KLA militias. We all feel that bypassing the UN and excluding Russia were mistakes and that we urgently need to bring them both back into play. We are all aware of the need to take each and every opportunity to reopen dialogue with a view to finding a political solution. We now need to give priority to everything that will enable us to move from the process of war to that of peace, everything that will enable the refugees to return to their land in safety as soon as possible. We will have to rebuild what has been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The peace plan drawn up by the current presidency, which you have just presented to us, Mr President, finally and happily breaks away from the mounting military action. It shows us a course that will not under any circumstances be that of increasing military action, which is something we should make every effort to resist. Mr President, before resentment builds up which could create a deep divide in Europe, we now need to put as much of our energy into seeking peace as we did into starting the war.</p>

At the time, Milosevic"s red army was shelling Dubrovnic and massacring at Vukovar, while this House remained indifferent. For five years, with the <span class="italic">Chrétienté‐Solidarité</span> movement I helped more than 300 Croatian children in Bosnia to be kept alive. I am even more ready to express my total and equal solidarity with the Serbian children who have been subjected to the ultimate in technological barbarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo is not Croatia. For the Serbs, it is not only a province, but the birthplace of their nation. NATO is not bombing Milosevic"s regime, but the entire land, all the people, the entire future of an ancient European and Christian nation. One day historians will have to explain why, up until now, NATO has only engaged in this war. NATO, which was formed in 1949 to protect Europe from Soviet imperialism, did not intervene on behalf of the people of Berlin in 1953, the Hungarians in 1956 or the Czechs in 1968. NATO is in fact solely the tool of the United States, which did not mobilise against the genocide in Tibet or Cambodia, or against the massacres in Lebanon. Today the genocide of Christians in Timor and Sudan is continuing with complete impunity. And NATO cares little about the situation of the Kurds in Turkey or the Kabyles in Algeria, where the habitual slaughter of women and children by the National Liberation Front is continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">So why this war against Serbia? For the Kosovars? Come on! They are also the victims of Clinton"s folly in supporting the KLA, which, we should not forget, is a Communist and terrorist organisation like the Kurdish PKK. NATO intervention is not a cure that is worse than the disease, it is a disease that is much worse than the disease. By bombing Serbia, in contempt of its sovereignty and of the rules of the UN, NATO is establishing the law of the jungle. By using the most obscene tricks of misinforming and brainwashing our people, it is also violating the rules of war. We are waging war against the Serbs, but we are denying them the moral right to defend themselves, and to take prisoners. It has even been said that, in the interests of democracy, they should have to put their television and radio at the disposal of their aggressors. Such claims and such contempt for the enemy have never before been seen throughout history. That does not give credit to our era. The Serbs are the baddies. The Serbs have the audacity not to recognise that the bombing is good for them, as the strikes are only a form of surgery. We want to cure them, and the swines are protesting! The Serbs are wicked, all of them. NATO has the enamelled whiteness of the teeth and clear conscience of Clinton the humanist.</p>
<p class="contents">However, enough of the sarcasm: Clinton, the cold‐blooded murderer of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, is once again a criminal. His crimes are crimes against humanity. Let us hope that his war, which you are slavishly supporting, will not lead, through a tragic chain of events, to the third world war and the end of mankind.</p>

He was assassinated after having stated publicly that Milosevic could not guarantee peace but could only generate a crisis. We also have a duty to pay tribute to the Serbs who are fighting for peace and freedom in their own country and who are risking their lives to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, I am only going to say two things at this stage. Firstly, this morning, Chancellor Schröder quite rightly said that the European Union must be a community of values and not simply an economic community and market. And the values that we are defending now are the values of respect for human rights and respect for life – the most fundamental value – that are being systematically violated in Kosovo as we speak. This is something that we have seen repeatedly in the tragic process of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, for years in Slavonia and Bosnia and now in Kosovo. And perhaps we will see it tomorrow in Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed something that Europeans cannot tolerate. We must therefore strongly support our Commission – particularly at the moment – as it is doing a good job. We must also emphasise that not only is military action underway but we are also seriously suggesting that a global solution for the Balkan problem be drawn up, as Chancellor Schröder mentioned again today. This would allow us to incorporate the process that has enabled Western Europeans to overcome so many centuries of barbarity and confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Mr President, it is vital that we support this plan, and that we give it our full support so that those who have been expelled can return home. This cannot be achieved through resolutions alone; it requires intervention forces. I should also like to point out that, at a time when the Amsterdam Treaty is about to enter into force, these missions are defined as Union missions under the so‐called ‘Petersberg missions". We must put them into practice.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Soulier </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Just this once I thank you, Mrs Bonino and Mr van den Broek, for your prompt intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to point out that four months ago, a man wearing a funny scarf was here among us receiving the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit. We owe protection to this man, because otherwise there will be no point in awarding this prize, which is a sort of Nobel Prize for spirit, each December.</p>
<p class="contents">I must highlight here today the peculiar situation that this man is in. He is considered to be a pacifist. He has fired no shots. He has not mounted an uprising, something for which some of his compatriots might even resent him. Mr Milosevic, who has protested his sincerity through some of our colleagues present here today, and is unable to accuse him of anything, says that he is now protecting him in Pristina from Serbs that may make attempts on his life.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must intervene. First of all, as I proposed in the resolution, we must invite Mr Rugova to come back to speak to us in Brussels or Strasbourg and tell us what has been happening to him, mainly because he feels bitter. As Mrs Renata Flottau said, he is having trouble understanding the silence of all those who have paid court to him over the years, awarded him their prizes, been photographed with him in order to attract media attention, and are now powerlessly watching as the Serb dictator humiliates him.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that he will be thinking of us, and I would like to make a proposal. It is true that our regulations are strict. The European Parliament has not declared war. It is free, and Members are free to speak. A few days ago I wrote to the Serbian chargé d"affaires in Brussels to tell him that in my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, but for the moment without authorisation, I am prepared, along with other colleagues, to go to Belgrade or Pristina. The European Parliament must consider sending a delegation – which can be quickly arranged – to go and meet Mr Rugova in Pristina and to bring him back here. I would like to say the following to Mr Milosevic: ‘As you can accuse him of nothing, here is the symbolic opportunity to show that you are preparing to return to peace. Hand Rugova over to us."</p>

But let us be honest. The West is now paying for its half‐hearted attitude in the early 1990s over the need for a military response to the atrocities in the Balkans. Recognising the independent states, with the exception of Bosnia, was in itself to some extent an acceptance of the ethnic discrimination which at the same time we find so repugnant. In Kosovo, it is about to happen all over again. Little has been learned from the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Little has been done for the Serbian opposition, and little has been done for Mr Rugova. We awarded Rugova the Sakharov Prize, but part of Parliament was busy giving encouragement to the KLA.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a fervent supporter of NATO. But the cynically technological NATO briefings hide the fact that we have become locked into a process whose consequences we cannot fully predict. Hence these questions of mine. How can we stop Milosevic from dragging down Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania to destruction with him? How can NATO extricate itself without using ground forces? The genie of an independent Kosovo has escaped from the bottle. The unilateral agreements reached at Rambouillet have been overtaken by events. How is the Council going to prevent the formation of a greater Albania? These questions are important. In the meantime, our duty is to take in the refugees and to be generous in making good the damage, including damage to Serbia once Milosevic has gone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I totally agree with Mr Soulier. I hope that Russian diplomacy will help us to resolve the difficulties and bring Rugova here, so that we can discuss his strategy with him face to face and incorporate it into the stability pact which the Council has drawn up.</p>

<p class="contents">The joint resolution we have before us brings shame on the European Parliament simply by having been tabled. If we vote in favour of it, it will be a disgrace for years to come. If the European Parliament wants to play its part, it should simply cry out in agony on behalf of the people of Europe: stop the war now! Respect peace! Leave the leaders of Yugoslavia and the legitimate leaders of the Kosovar Albanians to solve their own problems. They have demonstrated that they can. Get out of their way! Otherwise, why not call on the Turkish army, as Mr Titley suggested, to interrupt its ‘charitable" work slaughtering Kurds in Kurdistan to go to Kosovo and salvage the human rights that you are defending.</p>

When someone says that he hates war, everyone applauds him. But when someone does not say that he hates ethnic cleansing, that he rejects ethnic cleansing, then there is a problem. Some people say that the Serbs and the Kosovars should sort out their own problems; well, Milosevic has been dealing with the Kosovars" problems for ten years, and has been saying what he wants to do for ten years. In his speech in 1989 at the Field of Blackbirds, he explained everything. When I was young I was taught that I should read books. We have read what Hitler wrote, and he did what he had written. We have read and heard what Milosevic wrote at the Field of Blackbirds: he did what he had said and what he had written. He wanted to purify Kosovo so that the Serbs could regain it, and that is the current situation. In that situation, there have been attempts at negotiation, and there have been mistakes. Everyone has made mistakes. Rugova has led a peaceful resistance, and we awarded him a prize. That did not work. It is an awful situation, and the bombing has not heightened the ethnic cleansing: it was going on before the bombing started.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now proud of the German Government. I am proud of the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is currently trying to find a diplomatic and political solution to this conflict. However, a political and diplomatic solution and an end to the war must never mean the continuation of ethnic cleansing. We did not build Europe on the ashes of the Second World War to experience the tragedy of war now – and it is an unbelievable tragedy; I would never have thought that my son would see another war in Europe. We do not have the right to sit back and allow ethnic cleansing out of cowardice. Selection and deportation were Hitler"s weapons. We want the Serbs and Serbia to join Europe and stay in it, but not with ethnic cleansing.</p>

Kosovars have been driven out of their country in dramatic circumstances or are actually refugees within it. They are the victims of a totalitarian, ethnocentric nationalism which we deplore. But at the same time, I cannot condemn the NATO action, because I am aware that Europe stood by impotently for ten years, as Mr Cohn‐Bendit has just said, whilst the former Yugoslavia fell apart, and when Milosevic revoked Kosovo"s status as an autonomous region ten years ago, those familiar with the area predicted what would happen in the next few years. We did nothing at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must go back to a political framework, an acceptable international legal framework, which therefore has to involve the United Nations, the OSCE and the Russians too. We want the Kosovars to be able to return to Kosovo quickly, but without a political solution this will have to be done under military protection, as advocated in our joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should be sorry if this were to be military protection under NATO rules alone. We agree with those who advocate a European perspective for the peoples of Eastern and Southern Europe, so that respect for human rights and international law can stand together in peace and development.</p>

<p class="contents">The Members of this House are not, I believe, right‐wingers or left‐wingers, warmongers or pacifists; we are, I very much hope, just men and women seeking to point out that international law does not exist if human rights are not respected first. And therefore we cannot but be divided into two categories: those who are in good faith and those who are in bad faith, with those who fight for principles realising that force sometimes needs to be used to defend them, since force or war are not good or evil in themselves but necessary attitudes and decisions when it comes to fighting for human lives and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case we should note how Rambouillet has once again demonstrated the lack of European political union. If political union had been achieved a few years back, perhaps we would not have ended up with the tragedy we are witnessing today. If Europe had not just been represented at Rambouillet by four powerful nations but had been present as a political union, and if, prior to Rambouillet and at least since ‘92, Europe as a political union had sent a strong message – a strong and clear message – to Milosevic, maybe we would not have experienced all the wars, destruction and tragedy that we have seen. But things carried on as they did because of the choices made by certain governments and political forces: European union does not exist and all we can do is wait for NATO to represent what we ourselves are not in a position to represent. Let us hope that in the future Europe is able to achieve a political content and work towards a stability pact for the Balkans, that it is able to provide the deportees with the certainty they require in order to return home, in other words hope for the future, and that it is able to show solidarity with those who are hard at work – for example in neighbouring regions such as Puglia – in practical terms as well as in words.</p>
<p class="contents">We should give a vote of thanks to Commissioner Bonino and the <span class="italic">Arcobaleno </span> organisation, together with a clear message from ancient Rome: ‘<span class="italic">Parcere victis, debellare superbos</span> ". And Milosevic must be defeated, otherwise the warmongers and the arrogant will continue to trample on the rights of those acting in good faith and defenceless citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I conclude with a request, Mr President: if this Parliament were to convene an extraordinary sitting so that we could all meet at the border between Albania and Kosovo, this might be a good signal to send out at the end of a parliamentary term which has not brought political union but at least has established, between ourselves as Members of Parliament, a common will to be close to the people.</p>

<p class="contents">In this desperate and devastating situation for the Balkans it is more vital than ever before for politics to start playing its full role once again, or at least to try to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meeting of the European Council taking place over the next few hours it may be confirmed that both the European Union and the United Nations are to return to the political arena. The fact that the heads of government of the Member States are meeting with the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, seems to be a prelude to a European initiative – as was moreover announced here by the Council – which might, if there are positive signs from the Yugoslav side, enable a return to be made to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no doubt that the fundamental condition for any suspension of the Allied bombing of Serbia is an immediate cessation of all military activity in Kosovo by the Yugoslav side, the withdrawal of Serb forces from the region and an end to the repression and expulsion of the Kosovar population. And on these issues and principles all European countries must maintain the strongest and firmest possible unity. In the hours to come we shall see the details of the proposals put forward by Europe and by the United Nations. Everything will depend, quite clearly, on the Yugoslav response.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress that whilst a strong and united front among the European countries and NATO is vital, the option of a political solution should remain open. The NATO military initiatives in themselves are not a solution to the problem: they have been and still are the only way to try and stop activities which to all intents and purposes are now genocide as far as the Albanian‐speaking population of Kosovo is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the events of the past few days that the process of creating an effective European common foreign and security policy needs to move much more swiftly and that the Union should avail itself of all the political and practical instruments it needs to defend peace, security and respect for human rights, both on its own borders and in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to outline a solution to the complex problem of the Balkans it is furthermore vital for the Union to work out a strategy, a plan, to build up a long‐term political and economic stabilisation process for the region, including through stronger relations with the Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps today we are all paying the price for not having held out prospects of European integration for the region of the Balkans as well. At the same time there is an even clearer and more pressing need for the whole of Europe, including Russia, to work together across the board, as it were, in order to build a future of peace, progress and stability throughout the continent</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the political and diplomatic initiatives, humanitarian assistance for the refugees and the victims of Yugoslav repression needs to be coordinated and reinforced. There is a considerable awareness of this need throughout Europe. The <span class="italic">Arcobaleno </span> mission launched by the Italian Government has met with the approval and active support of most of the public and civil society in our country, which is springing into action in a remarkable way.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that – above and beyond what has been done up until now, and this is already a great deal – the Council, the Commission, the Member States" governments and the whole of the international community should step up and fine‐tune their efforts to help the people of the region. Today this is the acid test for the present and future construction of Europe.</p>

The reasons for the intervention, to defeat the madness of a dictator who has come up with a barbarous and inhuman plan, are justifiable, but if the bombs do not resolve the matter, I feel that – unless Mr Dupuis is suggesting sending in ground forces, which up to now has been ruled out – political logic calls for negotiations, since we want to avoid the option of a war which is won or lost.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Verheugen said, we did not intend to wage war on Serbia, all we have in mind is to return people to the land from which they have been expelled. We must therefore make every effort to ensure that Kofi Annan and the UN are successful in their endeavours, that Russia is involved and that Rugova can become a partner in the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">May I now make one final point, Mr President. We are defending those who run the risk of becoming a wandering and dispossessed people. There are urgent needs, and while we should be grateful to Commissioner Bonino and Commissioner van den Broek for the work they have done, this is just a drop in the ocean and the situation is explosive. In Italy, as Mr Vecchi told us, LIT 30 billion have been collected from the public and EUR 150 million is available: we would like to know what is the precise extent of the existing needs. What also interests us, and this was accepted by the Council, by the current presidency in fact, is the request made in the other Assembly for a stability pact. This is the objective to follow, because rather than winning a war, we want to make peace win the day.</p>

<p class="contents">According to Articles 1, 3, and 5 of UN Resolution 3314/29 of 14 December 1974, NATO"s attacks and Solana"s decision can be considered a war crime.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Carrère d"Encausse </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, war has returned to our continent for the first time in fifty years and we do not know how long it will last or how it will end, but wars always come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the time that I have, I will not talk about the causes, aims or responsibilities of war. I would simply like to take a look into the future, beyond the war, at the European landscape that will be the framework for the peace that is built, and at the aims of peace. That part of the continent in which the war is taking place has fallen prey to demons that we thought no longer existed. The Pandora"s box from which they come reveals some terrible contents. First of all there is the suffering of all those affected by the war: the Albanians who have been driven from their homes, but also the Serbs, who we should be careful not to confuse with Milosevic; they tremble at the bombs and watch in terror as their country"s economy is destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another demon is that of the division of Europe. It is back. Hopes for a united continent are dying. They have given way to the old situation, with on the one side a strong and united Europe – our Europe – which is capable of deciding its own fate, and on the other side another Europe that has to suffer a fate that it is not yet able to choose. There are many signs of this division. The Ukraine has decided to become a nuclear power once again. The plan for a union between Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, even though it is a plan that has no future, sends a clear message. In the face of the Europe of the Fifteen, Slavonic Europe is seeking to organise itself. What a defeat for us all!</p>
<p class="contents">Yet another demon is nationalism, which is never really dead, but which is gaining new impetus and spreading. Let us not forget that not long ago, the majority of Serbs saw Milosevic as a dictator. Now those same Serbs are rallying around him, purely as a result of a nationalist reflex. The resurgence of nationalism is also reflected in a new attachment to ethnic and religious differences. What a regression! However, after the war, the Serbs and the Albanians will have to learn to live together again and, with time, forget their hatred. No peace‐keeping force will achieve this result. The people will be the ones to decide. In the East, a very serious consequence of this war is that those who were part of the totalitarian system have regained their prestige, to the detriment of those who wanted democracy and reform. Courage will be needed now in Russia, to curb this tendency, and in Belarus, to continue to oppose Lukashenko. There are other examples too.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, it is not only Serbia which has been destabilised, but the entire Balkan region, where there is increasing doubt amongst public opinion about the legitimacy of the borders and the possibility of living in peace with different peoples. There needs to be an immediate response to this unstable situation in Europe, which is the framework for future peace. First of all, we urgently need to move back towards political solutions. War is never an end in itself. It is a tool used in exceptional circumstances for political relations between states.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must not delay in bringing back into the debate two entities that have been wrongly excluded: the United Nations, a symbol of law, and Russia, which still has a great deal of influence in the Balkans and indeed in other countries in the region that could be useful in providing troops for a peace‐keeping force that Milosevic would find harder to reject than he does NATO. Have we tried that?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Europe of the Fifteen must take the initiative, on its continent, to find a channel for negotiation and to curb the general destabilisation of the Balkans. The future of our Europe, that of the continent and of the people who live in it, depends on it. Time is marching on: we must hurry!</p>

That is quite incorrect. We totally condemn the criminal policy of ethnic cleansing being pursued by the Yugoslav regime and believe that Milosevic should stand trial before the courts. The world community has a duty to intervene in defence of human rights. The solution to this situation should be based on the right of the Kosovo Albanians to return home to an undivided and autonomous Kosovo under UN or OSCE protection, as part of a stability pact for southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that the NATO bombardments are wrong and have visibly failed. Room must therefore be made for non‐violent alternatives. Finding these will take time and demand patience. Nelson Mandela negotiated for years. The Dalai Lama – after 40 years in exile – calls not for aerial bombing, but for the possibility to negotiate with a regime which this Parliament has condemned for its breaches of human rights. Why did we abandon the pacifist Rugova in order to support a guerrilla movement about which we know precious little? I fully agree with Mr Soulier on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at what NATO has on offer. Three weeks into the bombing, it is proposing to deploy 300 new warplanes, mobilise reservists and persist with the military campaign. That is what NATO has on offer. According to the International Peace Bureau, NATO ‘has so far done nothing but accelerate the repression, unite the Serbian nation around Milosevic and alienate the Russians".</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the UN has been made to look foolish. I quote from <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> of 2 April, in which Sweden"s former prime minister, Ingvar Carlsson – in an article written jointly with his co‐chairman on the UN"s Commission on Global Governance, Shridath Ramphal – asked: ‘What if in a virtuous rage China invades Taiwan?" Dangerous precedents have been set and it behoves us all to be aware.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us imagine for one moment that NATO is serious in its intent; that all the allegations of cynicism are misguided; and that people mean what they say when they wax lyrical about peace. Surely it would still make sense to acknowledge that the outcome in the field demonstrates that thebombing has failed and must be stopped – unless the idea is to prove that the operation was a success, even though the patient died.</p>

That is why the generals should only intervene after the politicians have failed. But what does a military leadership do if it has been instructed to win a war without waging a war? At present the necessary military action by NATO has been taken on the responsibility of a group of politicians who once upon a time loudly proclaimed themselves pacifists and opponents of war in the peace movements and are now ordering a war without wanting to dirty their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a wide gap between instructions and means here. If peace is to be achieved by political means then the military have to withdraw. If it is to be achieved by military means the politicians must withdraw. At present the two areas of responsibility are being confused in an unprofessional manner and two half‐measures certainly do not make a whole. In addition to the aggressor, those who are incapable of intervening at the right moment with the right methods also bear responsibility for the plight of the people.</p>

We endorse the NATO action on Kosovo. Military action was sadly unavoidable in the light of Milosevic"s response. That action is necessary if the Albanians are to have any future in Kosovo. The European Parliament must leave no room at all for doubt today about where it stands on this. Of course, the starting‐point remains the search for a political solution, but it has to be on the basis of Rambouillet, with an international military presence on the ground and the refugees able to return to an autonomous and democratic Kosovo. Given all that has happened since Rambouillet, that looks very much like an international protectorate. So be it, then. But that means troops. To my mind, these should as far as possible be European, including the Russians. The conflict is after all a European one. Essential requirements will be a robust mandate and an effective command structure. The EU is not NATO. As far as military operations go, the EU is a minor player, and a degree of modesty is appropriate. All efforts to forge a European security policy have so far remained wishful thinking. For the second time, the European Union is playing a subordinate role, despite the Amsterdam Treaty. But that is not to say that the EU has no role. The EU is politically behind the NATO action, as the German Chancellor has reaffirmed this morning. The EU must give a lead in accepting refugees, in the region to begin with and later outside it. Albania and Macedonia need help. The EU must take on the responsibility for rebuilding Kosovo, as it did in Bosnia. The EU must be forward‐looking and not allow a third Balkan conflict to happen, because there is still a good deal of material for conflict, even after Kosovo. Stability in the region must not be seen purely as a military concern. Investment in cooperation, socio‐economic development and the quality of democratic society are equally important. This, ideally, is the substance of a stability pact for the southern Balkans, in which the European Union, under the Amsterdam Treaty, should give a lead, for example by the pursuit of a common strategy. An approach or stability pact of this kind must also hold out the prospect of increasing close cooperation with the EU, because that kind of cooperation, of integration, is and remains the best instrument for peace which Europe has to offer.</p>

People keep saying things that no longer bear any relation to reality. They say we must return to the negotiating table. Think how long we went on negotiating, without any result except that the situation became ever worse. We must finally look at the situation realistically and realise that if we want to be credible we have to take a credible democratic stance. That means realising that people are not there for countries, but countries for people. So if we expect the Kosovars to return under the rule of those who drove them out of their homes and murdered their families, we are asking something humanly impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">We should finally be totally realistic and pragmatic. People keep saying that ground troops could perhaps be deployed. I think that is a big mistake because European ground troops have often failed in their aims in this region. But the Kosovars are in their home country. I myself saw in Croatia – and I was often in Croatia during the time of the war – that the Croats were successful when they had more or less the same weapons as the Serbs. They chased them out, for people who are defending their own territory are far stronger than the aggressors who always come with a bad conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say something encouraging. People keeping asking what will then become of the Serbs. First of all, Milosevic is not Serbia. The Serbs are not Milosevic, just as the Germans were not Hitler. But we must finally realise that we cannot make peace with Milosevic because he will only start to commit his crimes all over again. Secondly, we must do our utmost to ensure that the policy pursued here is based on realism and not on illusion.</p>

We need to learn the lessons of the last few months. Some four months ago in this Chamber I said that Europe would fight and that Europe would be right and that the key thing was to persuade Mr Milosevic of our intentions that we would fight. And fight not just in the air. That is the cosmetic dishonesty of limited involvement. That is the arrogant assumption that you can have victory without risk, or power without bodybags.</p>
<p class="contents">By telling Mr Milosevic that we would not fight on the ground, we invited the vicious and predicted Serbian response on the killing ground of Kosovo. One million people are this week paying the price for the hard lesson which has to be learnt by all of us and primarily by Third Way governments – whether in this continent or in America – who have to learn the lesson that in the case of peace and war there is no Third Way. It is no good Mr Bianco saying this is not a war to the Serbs. It certainly feels like a war to the Serbs.</p>
<p class="contents">So I say to the Council that if you want Mr Milosevic to negotiate the peaceful admission of international troops; you will first have to persuade him that, in the last analysis, we are prepared to use troops to enter Kosovo aggressively. You cannot have one without the other when you are dealing with Mr Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">Rambouillet is dead. In the long term we will have to look at an independent Kosovo, but that will have to be an independent Kosovo, in a new Balkans, in a new Europe that incorporates a democratic Serbia. That is the thinking you have only just begun to take on board at the Council. I beg you to accelerate that process.</p>

To ensure that this principle, which is still somewhat hazy today, does not lead to an arbitrary and selective act of force, it should be incorporated into international law and should depend upon one institution: the United Nations.</p>

<p class="contents">After three weeks of war, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated appallingly in Kosovo, where apart from the ethnic cleansing pursued by Milosevic, there has been a constant hail of NATO"s depleted uranium missiles, DUs. When they return, the Kosovar people will have to protect themselves from the land"s radioactivity for centuries.</p>

Nor should there be any doubt as to the EU"s desire to take responsibility in both humanitarian and economic terms for the huge outpouring of refugees. And it goes without saying that the standards the world has set for human rights must hold sway over the claims of nation states to sovereignty. The demands of international law cannot, however, be put aside. If such laws are wrong, they need to be changed, not broken.</p>
<p class="contents">What is so worrying is that Europe has stumbled into a war which has produced a million refugees, yet there is no evidence of any policy to extricate ourselves from the crisis. A colonel who has been witnessing the collapse of Yugoslavia over many years made the following point: ‘Either people were plain stupid when they decided to launch this war, or they were extraodinarily cynical in believing that the flood of refugees and the attendant human tragedy were a price worth paying."</p>
<p class="contents">The prime task for the EU now is to work for a political solution; to put a end to ethnic cleansing; to support the refugees; to stop the bloodbath; and to create real opportunities for the refugees to return. It is not enough for the EU to be welcoming Kofi Annan"s offer to mediate and bring an end to this conflict; it should be giving him its active support.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a duty to establish the UN as the paramount body for overseeing the rule of law in the international community. The EU must now call for a peace‐keeping force under UN auspices, involving Russian peace‐keeping troops, so that ethnic Albanians can return to their homeland. The EU must see to it that the UN special tribunal on Yugoslavia swiftly undertakes investigations into war crimes that have been committed. Equally, countries need to be encouraged to ratify the agreement setting up the International Criminal Court, so that we have an instrument to deal with war crimes in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be the EU"s task to sanction NATO"s military initiative. The Union"s task is to devise constructive solutions – politically, diplomatically and economically – to this and other conflicts.</p>

For many years these people have moved freely in Bosnia, despite the presence of SFOR troops and have remained free, despite the serious allegations made against them.</p>
<p class="contents">What must also concern us is the escalation of the conflict beyond Kosovo and into Albania. The Serbs must stop their incursions into Albania now. I was particularly struck by the sincerity of the presentation made to us by the German presidency, and indeed by Commissioner van den Broek. I welcome the three‐phase peace plan proposed here.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of the United Nations in the conflict would be a welcome step forward. I look forward to further details of this plan and hope that it can form the basis for meaningful negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all very concerned by media reports coming from Kosovo, especially of rape being used as a weapon of war. It is a despicable repeat of the most heinous crimes committed during previous conflicts this decade in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">President Milosevic has a ten‐year record of terror and manipulation. He has shown repeatedly that he can play on ethnic fears and has presided over an expansionary regime based on terror. The solution to this horrific 20‐day bombing campaign will obviously involve negotiation. We cannot ignore the reports of great human rights abuses. We want peace – yes, but not at any cost.

Bombing has not stopped the killing, but increased it. It has not put an end to the catastrophic humanitarian situation, but intensified it. It has not advanced a political solution, but retarded it. It has consolidated Serb opinion behind Milosevic and weakened the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that NATO bombing was justified outside the United Nations because two permanent members of the Security Council would have blocked it is a body blow to the UN and a most dangerous precedent. The bombing needs to be stopped. The proposals put forward for a settlement on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions including a United Nations peacekeeping force with Russians should be wholeheartedly supported. Above all, an immediate cease‐fire is required, to concentrate on the terrible plight of those displaced and their return home.</p>

During the peace talks in Rambouillet on the outskirts of Paris, it gradually became absolutely clear that the people representing Yugoslavia's President Milosevic at the negotiating table were only there for show. At the same time they were able, under cover of the peace talks, to continue with the cleansing of the Kosovar Albanians. The cleansing continued during the negotiations in Rambouillet. At that time 60 000 Kosovar Albanians were in flight, and over the past year several hundred thousand have already been forced to flee. NATO therefore answered Milosevic by employing the means that we had said would be used if the talks did not produce a result, namely military force. Milosevic was not unaware that this could be the consequence. He simply did not believe that the West would use the means that we are now using to tell him that talks have taken place – and plenty of talks have taken place, but Milosevic would not negotiate. Now he should negotiate, but the bombing will continue until he comes to the negotiating table.</p>

No SFOR military personnel have been killed in Bosnia in combat, only in traffic accidents: the threat of using arms has been sufficient.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in this most serious of debates about the war in Kosovo, I thank you for having exceptionally allowed me to speak out in favour of one single refugee, resident in my constituency in Essex, who fears he will be forced to return home to the midst of the conflict. This man has legal immigration status in Britain but has helped himself by attaining a job, one which itself involves foreign travel in other EU States. Yet the delays in issuing the necessary visas from the Member State embassies in London currently threaten his employment on which, in turn, his immigration status depends.</p>
<p class="contents">When the whole of Europe is turning its eyes to the hundreds of thousands of refugees on the borders of Kosovo, it may seem strange to raise this one case. But our humanitarian concern must extend to each and every individual refugee as long as their safety is threatened, wherever they may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that my parliamentary question is referred to this debate, will Mrs Bonino in her reply, and the representative from the Council taking note, commit themselves to investigate this individual case and the anomalies in European immigration procedures between Member States which threaten his status. Do not send this man back to a war or to possible death.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate has shown that with the exception of one political group, this House is unanimous in condemning the method of mass deportation used – and not just recently either – by Milosevic. I also feel that views have differed slightly about what should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want peace, except perhaps Milosevic. And this is something we should keep in mind: if there is anyone who has pursued an ultra‐nationalistic plan for ten years, which history shows to be a losing battle but which is bloody and cruel and has cost the lives of millions of Croats and Bosnians, that person is Milosevic, who has pursued, caused and used war for ten years. So, we want peace but he does not, and it is important to say so. The problem is how to force this man to accept a solution, a reasonable solution, after ten years have gone by. I believe that after ten years the use of force was the only option. And I say this as a person who believes in non‐violence as well as in my capacity as a Member of the Commission. But there is more to it than that. For ten years now – I repeat, ten years – there have been negotiations with Milosevic, plus conferences, counter‐conferences, partial agreements and full agreements, but they have never led anywhere; each agreement has just prepared us for the next massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are seeing a sort of collective amnesia in our countries. Is it possible that names such as Osiev, Vukovar, Srebrenica, Bihac or Sarajevo no longer mean anything to anyone?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Could it be that all this never happened? Or that we have forgotten all about it? Am I mistaken or were you not the very people who wanted to face up to the disgrace of Sarajevo, saying, ‘Never again should we witness the cowardice and shameful behaviour which allowed the events of Sarajevo to happen"?</p>
<p class="contents">For once, ladies and gentlemen, what is at stake is not oil, or diamonds, or even territorial conquests, for once what is at stake is the right of an entire people to live in their homes, in peace and dignity, and for once when force is used we discover all of a sudden that this is not acceptable. What is the point? Yet another Rambouillet? This is the question I think we should ask, and above all the answer that should be given. I hope that we can end up with a serious conference, a situation in which commitments entered into will not just be taken seriously but be verified and verifiable as well. I do not want us to fall into the umpteenth trap of a half‐way agreement, which might even prepare the ground for a massacre in Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">There is one point I wish to stress during this debate, and that is that today we are witnessing the break‐up and annihilation of Kosovo and of an entire people. And all this did not start on 24 March, ladies and gentlemen; back in August – perhaps we were all on holiday, or had our minds on other things at the time – there were already 400 000 displaced persons in Kosovo, forced to wander across the mountains. It was these people who were then being kept inside the country and whom in the last few weeks Milosevic has fired off like human bombs at Albania and Macedonia. Let us hope he does not decide to fire them off at Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, even from a humanitarian angle, there is no aid organisation with the remit, the resources and sufficient preparation to deal with a human bomb of 500 000 people in a few days. I should like particularly to emphasise that the Commission may have resigned, it may be corrupt or whatever else you care to say about it, but perhaps you should try to understand the unusual institutional situation in which we have had to work, and I think we have nonetheless faced up to this situation and done what it was in our power to do. Let me repeat that at present there is no aid agency which could deal with 500 000 people in just a few days.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two further concerns of a humanitarian nature that I should like to voice. First of all, what in happening inside Kosovo, where the Kosovar population is without assistance, without protection and without witnesses either? The second concern relates to Montenegro. If a hundred thousand deportees are forced into Montenegro, this will clearly lead to disastrous instability there as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I very briefly mention three points on the humanitarian front. In the first place, this crisis shows us that in complex situations such as Hurricane Mitch in Central America it is sometimes impossible for aid workers to cope without the assistance of military structures. Of course, it would have been more appropriate to use the WEU. Fair enough, but for the moment it seems to me that the WEU is more of a virtual organisation than anything else, so I understand why Mrs Ogata wrote to NATO asking for technical resources at least to help with transport and setting up the camps and so on. We should bear this point in mind because, as in the case of Hurricane Mitch, in this situation there are times when it is absolutely vital to use military structures for civilian purposes, even if just for logistical reasons. Secondly, my colleague Mr van den Broek has already spoken of the need to give support to the countries receiving this enormous influx of refugees. We will of course ask Mrs Gradin to monitor the individual case that was mentioned. Finally, could I make one last exhortation: I do hope that all the efforts to show solidarity, including activities involving the general public, are made in a disciplined and coordinated way. There is a risk of bottlenecks developing and of the limited port and airport facilities getting clogged up. Furthermore, it is better to purchase supplies on the spot, hence money is better than food parcels. This is a very important message which we hope you will pass on.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank the Member States, starting with Italy which reacted swiftly and immediately, but not forgetting the other Member States which are making absolutely tremendous efforts to help. As you know, the part of the budget containing the available reserves amounts to EUR 150 million; bilateral cooperation and donations from Member States now amount to EUR 170 million. We should make sure that these sums are used in a coordinated and complementary manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope above all else that this institution is able to stand firm, to withstand the test of time and to get across a sense of leadership to the public, so that a distinction is made between the attackers and the attacked, the aggressors and the innocent victims, including Serbs. I would like to point out that humanitarian assistance is also being provided to the Serbs, via the Red Cross; there is no discrimination as far as we are concerned. I trust that together we will be able to face this tough and complex battle, fought so that national sovereignty should not mean ownership and so that the rights of the individual may be advanced.</p>

Depleted uranium is radioactive and highly toxic. Of course, it knows no frontiers when the wind decides to blow. Could we have a report from the Commission rather urgently, as well as from the Council of Ministers, of an investigation into whether or not we are using depleted uranium bombs. At the end of the day there is no time limit on the contamination of the environment.</p>
