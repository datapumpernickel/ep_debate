I agree that the European Union’s social dimension takes particular importance in a time of crisis, uncertainty and hardship like the present situation today. The unemployed, the vulnerable and the socially excluded expect Europe to show solidarity and help them in practical and clear ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The main EU instrument to support the employability and inclusion of the most vulnerable members of our societies will, of course, remain a strong European Social Fund. That is why the Commission proposed a guaranteed minimum budget for the ESF representing at least 25% of cohesion policy and that at least 20% of the funding for each Member State should be allocated to social inclusion measures. We also proposed that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be maintained and strengthened as a way to show real solidarity with newly unemployed workers in particularly difficult circumstances. In the Commission’s view, a programme to assist the most deprived people in Europe should form part of these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The harsh reality is that there will always be people in our societies in need of a programme of this kind and that is why the Commission’s proposal for the multiannual financial framework seeks to allow the EU budget to continue to finance full assistance under heading 1, where it also fits more appropriately with the poverty reduction target of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This would also be the best way to solve the legal impediment which was raised against the current scheme. As you know, discussions among the Member States on the legal basis for the current programme revealed difficulties in finding agreement on EU financial support for full assistance. The Commission had to take note of this, of course, but we will not give up on our right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, in our view, the EU budget could support full assistance in the future as well in the framework of a wider effort to fight poverty. The Commission is currently looking at various options on shaping the future programme within the cohesion policy framework in a way that maximises the impact of the support the various cohesion policy funds can deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">We still need some time to work out a model which is both effective and realistic. Let me close by thanking Parliament for its very helpful contribution to our work and for raising this point for debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the debate on the future of the programme, the Parliament repeatedly expressed its strong support for the continuation of food aid during the next funding period. In the resolution adopted on 7 July 2011, we called on the Commission and the Council to find a way of continuing the MDP scheme for the new funding period 2014-2020 on a legal basis that cannot be contested by the Court of Justice of the European Union, maintaining the EUR 500 million annual financial ceiling so as to ensure that people dependent on food aid will not suffer from food poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that before our vote on 15 February, Commissioner Andor, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, responded to a question asked by Ms Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, relating to the future of the scheme during the new funding period. In his answer, Commissioner Andor stated that during the next funding period, the food distribution programme should be financed under the heading of the first budget, since placing it there, in the Commissioner’s opinion, would best serve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy, which is to reduce poverty. The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission would, at the appropriate moment, use its right of legislative initiative and introduce the matter of the programme’s future into budget negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament regards this declaration as a clear message. The Commissioner’s statement is particularly significant in the light of the European Commission’s non-binding declaration of 6 December 2011. This declaration, issued under pressure from the programme’s opponents while attempting to reach a compromise in the Council as regards the programme’s future in 2012-2013, states that the Commission is taking into account the opinion of a significant number of Member States which believe that the programme should not be continued after 2013, without prejudice to the right to legislative initiative enshrined in the Treaty. The Commission will take into account strong opposition to any legislative or financial proposal for the programme’s future. Although this declaration is not legally binding, there is still…</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, food aid is being provided to 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At one level, this indicates how far we have to go in alleviating poverty and the huge challenges we still face. While the provision of food aid itself is certainly not sufficient to alleviate poverty, it can be one piece of the jigsaw, and indeed for those who receive food aid, it is an essential piece.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Commissioner Rehn that those who are likely to suffer from poverty expect a certain level of solidarity from the EU, and while I heard his positive comments about the European Globalisation Fund, unfortunately, his views are not shared by many Member States. I see that eight Member States have voted to scrap this fund or have said that we should do so. So, while there is Commission support and Parliament support for the continuation of this fund, this same level of support is certainly not forthcoming at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems that this programme we are discussing this morning is running into some difficulty with the Council and it certainly begs the broader question about the future of social policy. We are all aware that one of the five priorities of the EU 2020 strategy is to reduce poverty. Hopefully, the Commission will support Parliament in that. Commissioner, you will certainly get the support of this House for that programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is continuing for this year and for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have no time to lose in giving food banks clarity about the future after that. My worst nightmare scenario is that we continue giving food banks the idea that the programme will go on after 2014, only to discover – much too late – that it will not. If we do not give clarity now, food banks will not take the necessary steps to become independent of EU food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pretty sure that a majority can be found in this House to continue direct food aid in some form, but I am equally sure that there will be a majority in Council to block this and that there are even countries ready to go to court over it. Can the Commissioner confirm that a deal made in Council means that the programme could continue for two years, but on the explicit condition that it will stop after that? Can he also tell us whether there is a foolproof way to get around this Council blockade or whether the strategy is to propose something in the cohesion policy and then just hope for the best? Because if hoping for the best is all the certainty that we can offer food banks, I think we are doing the poorest people in Europe a disservice if we do not say very soon that the programme will stop giving direct food aid in 2014 so that they will have at least some time to adapt to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will do everything in its power to put concrete proposals on the table in the near future concerning where exactly the programme will be based and how it will be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is urgently needed and I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that the food programme becomes reality. This is not because I see it as a last resort, but because from my perspective, it sends out a signal that we still have a fundamental sense of solidarity with the day-to-day lives of those people in the European Union who, unfortunately, are not able to take part in any of the developments going on around them and who have become the first and most serious victims of the methods used by the European Union to combat the crisis. I am thinking about Greece, Spain and other countries where the measures that the European Union is taking are having the greatest impact on the poorest of the poor. We are sending out a signal but, unfortunately, it is no more than that. Therefore, I think we urgently need to put combating poverty at the top of our main agenda, and not just for the sake of the 18 million people in the European Union who are currently dependent on food aid. Until now, we have not sent out a clear enough signal. However, in my view, this is the decisive point if we want to continue to make progress and if we want the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in us to create a social Union with a strong sense of solidarity. In this respect, you have our support. However, ladies and gentlemen, we are also called upon to ensure that the governments which are currently blocking this programme adopt a different attitude. This is a personal commitment that we must make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The food aid scheme has been allocated EUR 113 million in 2012. This amount is lower than the previous amount of EUR 500 million. This scheme has reduced the food insecurity of the most deprived persons in the Union. An estimated 43 million people in the European Union are at risk of food poverty, meaning that they cannot afford a proper meal every second day. Many charities and non-governmental organisations around the EU recognise the importance of this programme and its special significance. We therefore need to find a way of continuing this programme without reducing its funding. I have to point out that in Lithuania, social tension is increasing due to dramatically increasing food and heating costs. The reduction in funding for this scheme will further exacerbate the situation for poor and vulnerable families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not without relevance who these companies are. I urge my fellow Members to investigate to whom these sums are distributed in their own Member States. I did, and the results were quite shocking. Hungary received an amount of almost HUF 4 billion in food aid, and a considerable portion of that money was distributed among enormous corporate giants rather than small and medium-sized enterprises. To give you just a few figures, Gyermely Zrt. received HUF 660 million, and Diamant Zrt. HUF 333 million. Both corporations, by the way, belong to a group of companies on which serious fines had been imposed for their prior involvement in cartel activities.</p>
<p class="contents">What interest could a Member State have in distributing these public funds among such corporate giants while what we actually say is that we support SMEs? It would be quite welcome if no Member State of the European Union made smallholders and SMEs feel that if they are not close to those in power, both politically and economically speaking, then they can only be losers, as is the case, for example, with those Hungarian farmers who are losing access to state lands in tender procedures because those, too, can only be awarded to friends, pals and cronies, just like these enormous food aid funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Siekierski and the other Members of Parliament who worked on the two committees responsible for producing this report, but I must start by pointing out that we reject the Commission’s proposal regarding the provisional nature of the aid. We will vote in favour of the programme as it has been drawn up, but we hereby reject in the House the concept that agreement was reached at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 14 and 15 December solely on the basis of a commitment to abandon the programme after this two-year period. Today’s vote is a positive vote, and tomorrow this will become a commitment to continue the programme. Among other things, the multiannual financial framework includes a reserve of EUR 2.5 billion for the 2014-2019 programmes under the Social Affairs heading.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore nothing to stop the Commission from following up the projections in the multiannual financial framework and confirming its intention to continue the measure. Too much of Europe is dependent on this programme. There is a great need for aid at the moment, and Europe cannot tackle the crisis with cuts and taxes, creating deprivation in government budgets and taking away aid from the poor. It is a short-sighted and blind policy that we cannot support.

<p class="contents">It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now.</p>
<p class="contents">What do you actually intend to do?</p>
<p class="contents">I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are proposing that the food aid programme for the most deprived should be funded under the European Social Fund (ESF). Commissioner, I would like to point out that the ESF is primarily intended to help people get into employment, which is an absolutely vital step on the way towards social inclusion. Social inclusion will not come about unless people’s employment prospects improve. We must not take our eye off the ball on this subject. We must continue to be very attentive and proactive on getting people into employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the food aid programme for the most deprived, I agree that the sums that we have allocated up to now – EUR 500 million per year – should be maintained so that the scheme can continue on a solid footing through to 2020. I also agree that you will need to convince those countries that are holding back at the moment. However, we cannot allow the conditionality clause on proper management to be attached to social affairs, as this would amount to penalising the scheme twice. I want you to know that we need this programme and that it has a great deal of support. It is your responsibility to keep it going. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is our job, naturally out of a sense of solidarity with the 18 million people who rely on it, to ensure that this programme continues. However, it must be given on a new basis. That is clear to all of us here. As Mr Lyon has already mentioned, the surpluses from European agricultural policy no longer exist. Therefore, we need to find a new foundation as quickly as possible which will allow us to establish a new distribution system, taking into consideration the court judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that we need to strengthen the existing regional initiatives responsible for handing out and for distributing food. We also need to include food banks in the supply network. In addition, we must provide security. We must not find ourselves in the same situation as last time, when we just managed to save a fund for two years. Now we have been talking about it for two years and we still do not know what will happen next.

In 2010, about 23.4% of the population, or 115 million people, were at risk of poverty and this risk is still present, even for workers in employment. According to Eurostat itself, this risk of poverty is closely linked to situations of poorly paid and poorly qualified employment, to jobs with no stability, and to part-time work.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called budget consolidation measures approved in this Chamber will certainly exacerbate the situation even more. No proposal can therefore be acceptable if, at such a difficult time, it deprives people and workers of the food aid that guarantees them a minimum standard of living and guarantees their right not to live in food poverty. It is obvious to us that if the annual EUR 500 million of funding is not at least maintained – and it would be desirable to see it increased – then the wished-for spirit of solidarity of the European Union will be even more compromised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, some Member States have regrettably advocated abolishing this mechanism completely from this year.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 18 million European citizens have received food provided by the food distribution programme for the most deprived persons and 80 million Europeans live below the poverty line. I would just like to stress one key point. We also have hunger and poverty in the European Union, and we cannot ignore this reality which has been exacerbated by the economic crisis. The figures mentioned above highlight how much this programme needs to be continued in the future as well. It would be inhumane to abandon this programme during a period which is looking increasingly difficult. Poverty will not disappear in 2013. This is why we need this programme to continue after this year as well. It must continue to be a European programme, as it has been right from the time it was set up, and enjoy the same funding as it has hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am asking the Commission to determine where it will actually be possible to include this in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I am strongly against any attempt to impose national cofinancing. The discussions on the future multiannual financial framework are already under way at the moment, but the continuation of this programme is still not being discussed publicly. I would like to ask the Commission to guarantee that this programme will not be completely overlooked in the discussions outlining the new multiannual financial framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, EUR 2.5 billion has been proposed by the Commission in the next multiannual financial framework. The Commission does indeed have the intention to exercise its right of initiative. I agree that food assistance forms part of our wider efforts to fight poverty in society and, most likely, this can only be accepted if it is part of a coherent set of instruments to promote social inclusion and, in particular, instruments that will be financed from the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Ms Cornelissen and several other honourable Members, I want to say that we do indeed want to fight for food assistance to be continued in the future too, as we have proposed, but we are aware that either an agreement or a definitive rejection has to be known early enough for food banks and charity organisations to be able to adapt to the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who ask why we should have this programme, our answer is that, at a time when we have very concrete and commonly agreed targets for employment and for the fight against poverty, the European Union simply cannot ignore the fact that more than 43 million Europeans cannot afford a meal with protein every second day, and that over seven million of our children do not have three meals a day simply because their parents are too poor. In the face of this reality, European solidarity cannot just be seen as an ideal, but becomes instead a moral imperative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, it is disappointing that a number of Member States have chosen to oppose continuing to provide support to the most deprived citizens from the common agricultural policy budget. I welcome the fact that the negotiations have been kick-started and that the programme will be continued until the end of 2013, which is the outcome of the efforts made by the Commission and the European Parliament.

I welcome the fact that this programme will continue this year because, in Romania alone in 2011, NGOs provided assistance to more than 2.8 million people on very low incomes. However, in my view, it is paramount that this aid also continues in the future. I think that the EU needs to provide support to deprived persons at a comparable level to this year as people in need still have to be given assistance. The Member States which oppose this measure must prove that they understand the situation of the poverty-stricken groups and agree to continue the programme under the necessary conditions.

It was unacceptable to have a properly functioning programme blocked by a group of states. The programme is perhaps more important today than at any time in the past. Food stocks are at an all-time low, the number of deprived people has risen due to the crisis – and I am afraid it will grow further – and food prices are also rising to dizzying heights. The programme must therefore be strengthened and its budget increased. The Commission, after all, suggested the same thing. Food is now harder to obtain from surplus stocks than at the start of the programme. It now has to be purchased on the open market, which is understandably more expensive. I am pleased that, thanks in part to the European Parliament, the dispute over the continuation of the programme has been resolved. Member States have received guarantees that the programme will be efficient and that as much money as possible will go towards purchasing food, and as little as possible towards related expenditure such as distribution and administration. The example from Slovakia shows that the distribution of flour was not entirely without problems, although this is not a reason to suspend the programmes but to make it more efficient. It is important for the programme to be further legitimised and popularised, as it is only in force for two years in its current form. A decision will then be taken on it again. I would hate to see a repeat of what happened last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our country, the aid programme for poor people works well and involves some 20 000 volunteers, 7 000 non-governmental organisations, Food Banks and the charity Caritas. There are many needy people in Poland, with two million people only able to meet their basic needs and five million in very difficult living conditions. In Poland today, four million people benefit from the food aid programme. They receive food products such as flour, grain and tinned goods, with 21 different types of product provided in 2011. It is worth noting that the food aid programme brings benefits in several areas. In addition to providing support for people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, it makes an important contribution to farmers’ incomes and the agri-food sector. For these reasons, EU food aid for deprived persons should be maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A sudden change in funding for the current, functioning programme, without prior warning or preparation, would have a major impact on the EU’s most vulnerable citizens. According to the Commission’s own estimates, 43 million people in the EU are at risk of a lack of food and, as a result of the economic and financial crisis and the sharp rise in food prices, this number may increase further. One of the five priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is to limit poverty and social exclusion. I therefore very much welcome the Commission statement promising that the programme will also continue after 2014. The EU budget must continue to participate in funding this programme, despite some Member States requesting a reduction in the EU budget. The demand of some Member States to end the food support programme is, in my opinion, reckless, coming precisely at a time when the most deprived sectors of the population are acutely affected by a crisis that was not of their own making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, Hungary will be granted more than HUF 4 billion from the EUR 500 million pool allocated to aid and can use that sum to support those in need. Last year alone, more than 3 500 tonnes of food were distributed to the most deprived citizens in Hungary thanks to the EU. This is particularly important to my country, where nearly one hundred thousand people are starving and a further 1 million are threatened by qualitative starvation. Amid the turmoil of the economic crisis and austerity measures, a projected 18 million citizens in 20 EU Member States will be in need of EU aid in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, the largest beneficiary of food aid, receives an amount of nearly EUR 100 million from the Community funds. The debate should therefore not be about whether we are providing food aid under social or agricultural policy. The common agricultural policy has always covered a number of social aspects. It is our joint responsibility to act in the spirit of European solidarity to bring food to the needy in times of distress. At the same time, the food programme reinforces the reputation of the European Union, which is at an all time low. I therefore firmly call on the Member States that are opposed to the food programme and on the European Commission to not impede the EU ‘food fund’ in the future. I, personally, and the European Parliament are fully committed to continuing this aid programme, which helps us combat social inequalities, after 2014 as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, 43 million people are affected by food poverty; 18 million needed help from the food aid programme for the most deprived in 2011 and 80 million people on our continent are living below the poverty line. For many European citizens, the question is no longer ‘what are we going to eat?’ but ‘are we going to eat?’. Through its spokesperson, Dacian Cioloş, the European Commission has proposed bringing the food aid programme for the most deprived under the umbrella of the economic and social cohesion policy from 2014 onwards. However, in the light of Germany’s announcement that it refuses to let Europe engage in social policy, there is cause for concern. In any case, the Belgian socialists consider it out of the question that this agreement should be a pretext for stopping European social support from 2014 onwards. It is important that we find a solution. We will be monitoring the situation to ensure that a new system is put in place for 2014 and beyond, in order to guarantee greater social cohesion and to prevent millions of people in Europe from sinking into outright starvation.

In 2010, about 115 million people in the European Union were below the poverty line, equivalent to 23.4% of the population of Europe. This situation requires the Member States to introduce social measures to support the most vulnerable, namely, children and the elderly. The effects of austerity have led to high unemployment rates, making it impossible to raise living standards in the Member States. Public policies are needed to support food distribution and to bring an end to wastage of food in restaurants and public canteens. At EU level, moreover, the Union must not only implement sectoral policies, particularly cohesion policy, but must also continue to support the food aid programme, which uses food surpluses to benefit 13 million people.

Unfortunately, some Member States have called for the funding for this programme from the CAP to be stopped. However, the Commission has suggested that the programme continues through the CAP during the 2012-2013 period to the tune of EUR 500 million per year, a proposal approved by the European Parliament and EU Council. Every year, the programme has contributed to distributing approximately 440 000 tonnes of food to 18 million deprived people from 19 Member States. We call for the programme to continue after 2013 as well and urge the Commission to integrate it properly into the future multiannual financial framework so that it can continue to help meet both the EU’s social objectives and the CAP’s objectives.

The European Union has undertaken to reduce poverty levels significantly by 2020, by coordinating current policies more effectively and by setting concrete goals. Alongside a series of other measures, the EU ‘Food for Free’ programme has become an important tool for overcoming poverty. In an area which actually comes under the authority of the Member States, it has been possible to help people who would otherwise have gone hungry by using resources from the agriculture industry. This important assistance, which directly benefits those affected and which has therefore also been able to convince a large number of people of the importance of the European project, is now likely to come to an end, as a result of disputes about responsibility and the opposition of some Member States. This will not only result in a serious reduction in the amount of food available to those sections of the population which are at risk of poverty and exclusion, but also to a further loss of credibility in the progress being made in Europe.

The aim is for the number of people at risk of poverty to fall by 20 million by 2020. In this context, I believe that it is important to continue food distribution, financed from EU funds, to needy people in the European Union. At present, EUR 500 million is spent on this scheme from the EU budget each year, and 18 million people benefit from this aid. Polish citizens are key beneficiaries of this scheme, since four million people receive assistance in the form of free food products, including staples such as grains, flour and tinned foods. Over 20 000 volunteers and many non-governmental organisations are involved in programmes to help the poor in Poland. It should be noted that implementation of the EU programme does not just provide tangible support for many poor people but is also important for agricultural producers, for farmers’ incomes and for agri-food processing companies.
