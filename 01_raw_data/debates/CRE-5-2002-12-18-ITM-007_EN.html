<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to give an account of this very important area of work in which my dear colleague Commissioner Vitorino has been extremely active ever since he started, and in which I believe we are starting to reap rewards of which I am pleased to give an account. With the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was decided that various measures on asylum and immigration should be taken within five years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is, 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the European Council repeated and reinforced its desire for action in these areas in Tampere in October 1999, in Laeken in December 2001 and in Seville in June of this year. In Seville, specific priorities were devised along with deadlines for adoption of the individual legal acts. We have not simply met these deadlines; we have gone even further. As was stated in the Seville conclusions, the Council must find the right balance between, on the one hand, an integration policy for immigrants who have settled lawfully in the Member States of the Union and an asylum policy that complies with the international conventions – first and foremost the Geneva Convention of 1951 – and with the efforts required, in particular the efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Seville conclusions has been a task of the Danish Presidency. This applies also to the issue of combating illegal immigration and administering the external borders. Seventeen different projects and initiatives have been implemented with a view to strengthening border controls at both sea and land borders and at airports. In addition, a general dispatch programme and a specific plan for the return to Afghanistan have been adopted. These two were approved a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to asylum policy, substantial progress has been made in respect of implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam objectives and the priorities set in Seville. The European Fund for Refugees was established back in September 2000, and in July 2001 a directive was adopted on minimum standards of temporary protection in cases of mass influx of displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Further progress has been made on the area of asylum under the Danish Presidency. There is now agreement in the Council on the Dublin II regulation, which is expected finally to be adopted. This was the particular task to be achieved under the Danish Presidency. This task has been achieved; there is political unanimity. There is possibly one more parliamentary reservation, but I am sure that we will be able to adopt the Dublin II regulation – possibly as soon as tomorrow, when there is a Council meeting in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is similarly expected to be adopted at the Council meeting tomorrow. Over the past six months intensive negotiations have taken place concerning the Commission’s proposal to set minimum standards for the recognition of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or persons in need of subsidiary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial progress has been made, and there is now political unanimity on the definition of a refugee and political unanimity on the definition of subsidiary protection. This unanimity is based on the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. We have achieved political unanimity on virtually all of Articles 1-19 concerning the basic terms used in refugee law. All that remains is the issue of the rights of refugees and of persons with subsidiary protection, which is why we can expect the proposal to be adopted by the summer at the latest, as was decided in Seville. The things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things. Some might say: that is all very well, but where is the skill in adopting something based on conventions that have already been in force for a long time? The answer is: it is skilful because it means that from now on these conventions must be observed in every country, and that includes the new Member States that we decided just last Friday to bring into the Union. Moreover, there is a big difference between having conventions and having directives. The difference is that the Commission has much greater authority when it comes to considering whether the directives are being complied with, and finally there is also the possibility of going to Court if countries breach the conventions. The answer to the question that I myself asked is therefore: it makes an incredible difference that the standards of these conventions are now being introduced in the form of directives.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council meeting in October we had an open debate on the Commission’s revised proposal on minimum standards for asylum procedures at which the ministers of the Member States contributed various comments on the proposal. This proposal, too, will be adopted by the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as immigration policy is concerned, the Seville conclusions state that the Council must approve the Commission’s proposal for provisions on family reunification and long-term residence status by June 2003. Substantial progress has been made in the negotiations on the revised proposal for a directive on family reunification – the proposal that was submitted by the Commission in May this year – and it is expected that it will also be possible to adopt this by the deadline set in Seville, that is, by June 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal on long-term residence status, on 15 October 2002 the Council discussed a number of outstanding political issues. A certain amount of progress has been made in this area under the Danish Presidency, but a number of crucial issues remain – including the right to a certain form of free movement. The Council will work towards meeting the deadline laid down in Seville for adoption of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, an open debate was held in the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs on 15 October 2002 on the Commission’s proposal for a directive on the conditions for entry and residence by third-country nationals for study purposes. Parliament has been consulted in all these cases, and Parliament’s statements have been incorporated, or will be incorporated, into the basis for the Council’s decision. The Council considers it very important that Parliament be involved in this area, to which the codecision procedure does not yet apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council looks forward to even closer cooperation with Parliament in the area of asylum following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I have, in this way, given you a comprehensive status report as regards the results achieved within the area of asylum and immigration policy. I believe that, overall, it conveys a positive picture. I agree that matters have proceeded too slowly. I know that the Commissioner felt this too, as indeed I myself did, when I sat on the relevant committee here in Parliament. Though I say so myself, I think that the Council has picked up speed, that we have eventually started to see quite a number of results and that we have started to live up to our own aims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the deadlines are met. Asylum and immigration policy is of great significance for the people concerned, and it is important that we achieve results and find the balance that I spoke about in the introduction to my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I could have spoken for much longer, since in reality there are a great many initiatives – for example, in the area of border controls, in which a full 17 initiatives have been implemented – which I could have talked about for a long time, but everything must come to an end, so I will stop here and let the Members’ contributions decide what we will discuss in more detail in the hour ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will continue to press ahead quickly with the examination and adoption of the several measures under discussion, as the European Council requested at both Laeken and Seville. I recognise that under the Danish presidency significant progress was made, not only as far as the Seville conclusions are concerned, but in particular on the development of the common asylum policy. This progress was due to the personal engagement and knowledge of Mr Haarder, whom I praise for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Dublin II regulation is expected to be formally adopted in the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow. Together with the start of operation of the Eurodac system, which is scheduled for 15 January 2003, this will constitute a positive step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fairly optimistic about the discussions in the Council on the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States. I share the President-in-Office's view that it is possible for the Council to have this directive adopted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the adoption of this legislation, the first phase of the common European asylum system is progressively taking shape. Two main elements of the system are still to be adopted. However, as the President-in-Office said, good progress was made, thanks to an energetic Danish presidency, on a common definition of 'refugee' and a common approach to subsidiary protection. Little remains to be done on this key proposal which could be adopted by the Council at its first meeting in 2003. I also expect the Council to speed up the examination of our amended proposal on asylum procedures, which we presented six months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of the utmost importance for the credibility of the Union in these areas, which are at the heart of public opinion's expectations about Europe, that substantive progress is really achieved. In such sensitive policy areas, the strategy of small steps will prove to be efficient and win the confidence of our citizens. Moreover, the time has come to consider seriously the forward-looking ideas that were recently presented by the High Commissioner, Ruud Lubbers, and which have been blessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Executive Committee. In early 2003 the Commission intends to put forward a communication where we will express our own views on the main elements of this new agenda for protection presented by Mr Lubbers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know – and as already mentioned by the President-in-Office – the directives on family reunification and long-term residence status are still under examination. I encourage the incoming Greek presidency to finalise these negotiations as soon as possible. It is possible to have them adopted during the first half of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules on admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment, presented by the Commission in July 2001, have now been complemented by a new proposal, presented in October, on the conditions for entry and residence for study purposes. Urgent progress is needed on these two texts, which are key elements for an active EU immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with regard to international relations, the Commission has recently put forward, on a joint proposal by myself and my colleagues, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, a communication presenting our views on the nexus between migration and development. In this document we also elaborate on the possibilities, but also the limitations, of the Community budget in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this occasion to confirm that the Commission will put forward a proposal in 2003 with the aim of establishing a multiannual programme of cooperation with third countries in the field of migration, working on the experience that we have gained on the basis of the use of budget line B7-667. Our intention is to respond in a specific and complementary way to the needs of third countries in their efforts to ensure better management of all aspects of migratory flows and to stimulate them in their preparation for implementation of the readmission agreements or to assist them in the implementation itself. This programme complements other Community cooperation and development instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The degree of harmonisation attained or currently being negotiated has often failed to meet the Commission's expectations. Certainly more could have been done. However, the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort. Those of us involved in the formulation of this policy should not forget that we have been pioneers in laying the first building blocks of European legislation and policy on such a difficult subject as migration and asylum, and Parliament most of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this first attempt at building a policy has also taught us a few lessons. This policy is still encumbered by too many institutional and legal constraints, as the President-in-Office was commenting in his remarks on conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Codecision should become the norm and general provisions should allow the Commission to formulate a fully harmonised policy. The objective should not be simply the achievement of minimum standards but a fully common asylum system. Unanimity in the Council – especially in view of an enlarged Union – appears more and more to be an invitation to stalemate. Therefore, I am very pleased with the constructive conclusions reached by the Bruton report within the framework of the Convention. They point in the right direction as to the future of European policy on asylum and migration. I am sure that those conclusions will receive the full endorsement of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That enlargement extends our borders to Russia, to Ukraine and Belarus – it is hardly surprising if issues of border control and immigration policy are centre stage. But when it comes to immigration, no country is an island. A real debate is needed at European level, and not the kind of distasteful sloganeering that we suffered at the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As a policy issue, immigration is simple. Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries, thus helping their people to prosper, we will take their people. And unless we set our own immigration policy, either anarchy will reign or – more worryingly – criminal gangs of human traffickers will set that policy for us. What a pity that our governments did not listen a little more carefully to the advice of the Canadian Government about how, if we wished to get on top of the trafficking in people, we should open our front door a little to legal migration, in order to close our back door more effectively against illegal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the proposals that he brought forward a couple of years ago at the beginning of this whole debate. I deeply regret that Member States did not adopt them as proposed. The debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects. The strategy has hardly been one of small steps as the Commissioners suggested – one of ‘faltering feet’ is perhaps a better description.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in this House for the first two years of that discussion. I regret not only the EU’s failure to establish effective and complete policies on immigration and asylum, but also its failure to ensure responsible stewardship of our economy which is intimately linked with immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s review of the European economy in 2002 shows the devastating economic consequences of stagnating population growth, which could lead to the rate of potential economic growth falling by 1% of GDP per annum for the next 50 years. What should we do? Well, exhortations to procreation have never been known to work. The evidence suggests that the higher our living standards become, the less people will want to have children. So for economic reasons too, we need a mature debate about a policy of managed migration. I hope that this afternoon’s debate will contribute to achieving some joined-up thinking on immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been asked to report on the readmission agreement with Hong Kong. I regret that Parliament has been neither consulted nor kept informed during the negotiations on this readmission agreement, that we find ourselves in the position of having to deliver our opinion after the agreement has been initialled – and, moreover, after the Agriculture Council on 23 December adopted the decision authorising its signing.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Rule 97 of our Rules of Procedure, throughout the negotiations – and here I quote: ‘The Commission and the Council shall inform the committee responsible regularly and thoroughly of the progress of the negotiations’. I deplore the fact that did not happen, all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community. In the case of future agreements, I ask that Parliament be kept informed about the state of negotiations by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Readmission is about the return of persons found irregularly on our territory. Few in this House would deny the need for a policy of return. It is an integral part of any credible immigration policy. Effective return safeguards the integrity of asylum policies and of regular immigration programmes and it acts as a deterrent to irregular migration. Return has risen to prominence essentially because of the way in which our over-stretched asylum systems are being used as alternatives to a closed-door immigration policy. When the Council adopted its return action programme at the end of last month, I am sure it took into account the many advantages of assisted voluntary return, as well as the possibility of forced return.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-punitive and a cost-effective way. It has been shown to work in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in the Netherlands and in Belgium. It is more convenient and it is less costly, both financially and politically, than deportation. It has been almost exclusively a European phenomenon and we need more research on the sustainability of return under AVR programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">But our policy needs to be rational, driven not by prejudice, but by a sober assessment of our needs. It must be carried out by governments who ought to resist the temptation sometimes to deport in order to seek approval from the mob. That policy must also address gender and health issues which are vital in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The readmission agreement on which I have been asked to report is the first readmission agreement that the Community is entering into. I share the Commissioner’s appreciation of the willingness of the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate this with us. There is a danger that today’s debate will be confused with a debate on Hong Kong tomorrow which reflects concern about the implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. Some may argue that Hong Kong is not a safe country. I accept the assurance given on 10 December by Donald Tsang, Hong Kong’s Chief Secretary, when he gave his personal guarantee about the free flow of information and the freedom of speech remaining essential characteristics of Hong Kong society. Nor have I any doubt that the Hong Kong administration is competent to administer a readmission agreement. Moreover the agreement itself refers to international commitments to the protection of vulnerable persons.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements. Authorisation has already been given for the negotiation of such agreements with many countries – some of them have even been initialled. The fact is that some of those agreements will be far harder than this one.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues. The first concerns the scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by the Member States, the categories of people involved and their countries of origin. Are the measures that Member States have adopted adequate and effective? Since this House is also very concerned to ensure that the policies of return and the readmission agreements we negotiate respect fundamental rights, I would also ask how the Commission proposes to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected in the event of repatriation, especially if this occurs on a large scale. Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law? Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements? The House would like answers to all these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know why the European Parliament is never mentioned in the Commission’s communication on a Community return policy. I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular. The role of the European Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority is clearly important in this, and I would be interested to know whether we will, from a financial point of view, need a new legal base for this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights clause in the readmission agreement used for Hong Kong is not strong enough to protect us against all eventualities in such agreements with other countries. We should recognise that, while concluding the agreement with Hong Kong was a relatively easy matter, as we were able to offer them visa-free access to the EU in return, cutting a deal with countries such as Russia and Morocco will be not a whit as easy.</p>
<p class="contents">We will need to provide incentives for many third countries to cooperate with us, rather than threatening them with economic sanctions, as Mr Blair and Mr Aznar proposed in Seville. That is why I welcome the Commission’s recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union’s external relations policy. If we join up the dots between this paper, our development policy, the negotiations on readmission and our economic need for immigration, we will be demonstrating the joined-up thinking we so urgently require in immigration and asylum policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am happy to see that has carried on and followed the evolution of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Commencing with Hong Kong, we welcome this first ever European Community readmission agreement with a third country or territory. It proves not only the willingness of Hong Kong to commit to cooperation in the management of migratory fluxes with the European Union, but it also reinforces the credibility of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as this concrete agreement is concerned, we have adopted a balanced approach. As you may recall, the European Union decided to grant visa-free access to Hong Kong citizens in March 2001 and, at the same time, we proposed the negotiation of a readmission agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that we should have kept Parliament better informed regarding these negotiations. In my defence, the only thing I can say is that there was only one round of negotiations. It would have been difficult to inform Parliament in the middle of the talks. Nevertheless, we take seriously the fact that we will now negotiate several readmission agreements. We need to introduce practical ways of consulting Parliament and keeping Parliament informed. I can assure you that I have already contacted the secretariat of the Citizens' Rights Committee to establish how Parliament can be granted direct access to information on how negotiations on readmission agreements are developing. I hope that I will be here next time to discuss readmission agreements with you and that I will then have a better story to tell you.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the oral question is concerned, the Commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by Member States. I can tell you that an average of 40% of the money allocated to Member States in the European Fund for Refugees is used to finance voluntary return. Only voluntary return comes under the provisions of the Fund for European Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">According to CIREFI statistics for 2001, with returns from 12 of the 15 Member States – the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands did not provide figures – a total of around 333 000 people have been returned.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, from January to September, 98 000 people have been returned by Member States, but this figure does not include the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg which have not provided us with the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that we need to have more accurate statistics on these issues. For instance, I cannot distinguish between voluntary returns and forced returns because national Member States' statistics do not make the distinction. I can give you the citizenship of those who have been returned but I cannot tell you to where they have been returned because, as you know, some of them have not been returned to their own country, they have been returned to the countries through which they entered the European Union. We recognise the need for better information and, therefore, we will present a proposal during the Greek presidency to have a specific instrument for exchange of harmonised and standardised statistics so far as asylum and migration policy are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enforcement of decisions to return people, the Commission has no responsibilities so far as enforcement is concerned. That is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States. Nevertheless, we believe that some instruments should be adopted at European level. For instance, mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is a key element. There is an instrument with very limited scope in this area; we are now assessing how it has been working in practice and I hope that next spring we can present you with our evaluation of how mutual recognition of expulsion decisions works in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the standards for expulsion. We believe that we should have some common standards at European level for decisions to return people; I therefore hope we will be able to present some specific proposals on this topic fairly soon. I recognise that the Commission does not have any instrument for monitoring post-return situations. It is not within our remit and we do not have the tools to make such an evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I welcome the idea of having a broad debate on return policy. As you know, we have published a Green Paper, we have presented an action plan and the Council has endorsed this action plan. I hope that, in the framework of the debate on communications about migration and development, we will be able, together with Parliament, to discuss what the key elements of return policy in the European Union are. I am looking forward to hearing Parliament's view on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, asylum policy is particularly difficult, and has many unpleasant aspects. One major aspect is the fact that a large proportion of asylum seekers are ultimately faced with the prospect of return – or even forced return. This is something that always attracts a great deal of attention and arouses emotions amongst the general public. While on the one hand enormous pressure is often exerted on politicians to turn away as many asylum seekers who may not be entirely legitimate as possible, on the other hand people are extraordinarily moved by those who ultimately have to be sent back, sometimes even after many years. We do have to take account of the often highly contradictory emotions of the general public. Besides, voluntary return is not always straightforward, and I have learned that an organisation such as the IOM, for example, at least in the Netherlands, is often very unsuccessful. The number of people who have been organised to return voluntarily to their own country or to their former country is relatively low. The whole of our asylum policy – or at the very least our return policy – must meet the requirements of human dignity in all respects.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a point to which we must pay much attention, and I am also pleased that we are working on the aspect of return in an orderly fashion in agreements such as the one with Hong Kong and others currently in preparation. It goes without saying, however, that these should include other aspects than just the return clauses. With regard to what has just been said about checking up on what happens to people who have returned, I believe that there are many things that we can do about this in an EU context as well. Governments often say: OK, our embassy will keep in touch with people who are sent back despite the fact that they claim to be in danger in their own countries. Such cases naturally occur in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that it is important to create a particular specialism in the embassies of the Member States in order to find out whether it is possible, in some cases, to keep in touch with people who have returned so that we can be sure – really sure – that their return was a considered judgment by the person who sent them back.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Hong Kong agreement is concerned, I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Watson says about it. It is of course a pity that we are being asked for approval at this very late stage. Its legitimacy naturally depends on our approval. We are therefore justifying this approval now. This is in fact a risky reversal of procedures, but I take Mr Vitorino, whose good will has been demonstrated on several occasions in this Parliament, at his word when he says that he will ensure that other opportunities for notifying Parliament about such documents earlier on will be investigated in the future so as to enable us to make a material contribution if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the clarity of European policy is concerned, Mr Haarder has already spoken about this. I think that it is very important, particularly from the point of view of human dignity in respect of third countries. If we have a homogenous, or relatively homogenous, asylum policy, one in which we have co-ordinated many different standards, we will be able to provide information on it in third countries so that the people there will know what treatment they can expect everywhere in the European Union. This will give asylum seekers who are really only trying their luck the opportunity not to try their luck, the opportunity not to remain in debt with their families, fellow-villagers or neighbours, but to stay where they are and not risk returning penniless.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I have a question about the European Fund for Refugees that was mentioned. Is it possible for the European Fund for Refugees to have a better future, and is it possible for the European Union itself to therefore address itself to the matter of relief in the region to a greater extent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Apart from this decision, you have not taken any great measures, either in this Council or in any other, in relation to the field of immigration at least.</p>
<p class="contents">We have on the table a full range of proposals from the Commission in relation to immigration policies, a proactive immigration policy, and I will not list them since I will bore Parliament if I do so in every speech. None of them have been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council in Seville, without having done its homework in this field, the Council once again established priorities and time limits in relation to immigration policy. They began to talk there less about this policy and more about the fight against illegal immigration. But we have not made much progress on that either. In any event, what did happen there was to begin to talk about this in a different way which gives me some concern. They began to talk about the return of immigrants, the control of external borders, in a way in which there is not much room for many concrete proposals. There was talk of security, the term border control was introduced into this field and, listening to you, it appears that illegal immigration has to do with lack of security. If you take a walk around our cities, you will see that illegal immigration has more to do with domestic staff, people working in agriculture and people working in our restaurants. And we know who they are. To give you a figure, in my country, and in just one town close to Barcelona, L'Hospitalet, which has 800 000 inhabitants, 17 670 people have been recorded, many of them illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">During this period, the Commission has presented two proposals which provide a global approximation of the issue, as laid down in the Tampere conclusions: the Green Paper on return, the inclusion of the immigration policy in the Union’s external policy. Of course, this global approximation must include a repressive aspect, but in order to ensure the fulfilment of an immigration policy, in order to control illegal employment – if Berlusconi will allow me – in order to establish a policy for integration of external trade. If we do not have this global approximation, if we do not focus on this approach, we are not going to be effective in the fight against illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the speed problem, there has been a spurt on asylum policy under the Danish presidency. I too pay tribute to the energy of Mr Haarder. However, on the question of balance, I still feel very frustrated that legal migration and rights of migrants have been neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">There is so much criticism of migrants who fail to integrate, but little is done to assist them through, for example, family reunification or rights of free movement. Let us take, for example, the reception conditions directive which highlights the classic danger of the ‘lowest common denominator’ approach imposed by the unanimity rule. This is not Mr Haarder’s fault. After apparent agreement on the text last April, debate was reopened. The result was that the Germans got their way, and consequently there is no requirement to allow asylum seekers to work if a decision on their case is not forthcoming within a year. The British have got their way in that Member States will be allowed to refuse reception assistance where the asylum seeker cannot show that he has made his claim as soon as possible. If there was qualified majority voting and codecision with this Parliament, neither clause – I am sure – would be in this text since a more progressive majority would have prevailed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of return, are we forcing women to return to Afghanistan, to an environment described by Human Rights Watch as being just as oppressive as it was under the Taliban? Spied on by teenage boys, women are marched to hospital and forced to undergo abusive gynaecological examinations to prove their chastity. They still have to wear the burkha, which is medieval. I suggest that we cannot guarantee the security of women returned to Afghanistan.</p>

Furthermore, I wholeheartedly support the comments made by my fellow Member, Mrs Terrón i Cusí. I believe that, although we set the objective of harmonisation with the Treaty of Amsterdam and we took a huge step forward at Tampere, thanks, amongst other things, to Commissioner Vitorino’s involvement, we took two steps back with the Seville European Council. Because, rather than talking about a global harmonisation policy, about a policy which will take proper account of all the disparities, all the complex points of existing laws, and which will bring about harmonisation, everything is focused on the issue of illegal immigration instead. What was proposed at Seville was very disturbing, because if we had carried the Seville proposals through to their logical conclusion, we would have imposed sanctions on the countries of the South that are already suffering from famine, war and violence. We would have imposed sanctions on them to force them to take back their nationals. This shows that we understand nothing: we do not understand that those who migrate do not leave their country out of pleasure: they leave because they are victims of violence and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue that concerns me as well, Commissioner, that of the ‘brain drain’ affecting the countries of the South. Today, as we know, nobody objects to admitting young IT professionals. Nobody objects to hiring young students either. However, when it comes to the question of the immigration of regular and regulated flows, we will no longer accept anyone. We fall back into the trap of these old fantasies or, quite simply, of meaningless phrases such as zero immigration or ‘wide-open’ borders. In seeing people come to our countries and fall into the hands of slum landlords we clearly find the great liberal ideal which drives some of us. .</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by also saying that I am shocked to see that the majority of immigration policies are dealt with by the Home Affairs Ministers. I think that this issue must be a part of a co-development policy, since it does not stop at sanctions. We know that, today, the UK army can turn people away and we know that there are refugee camps in France. In my view, therefore, cancelling third world debt, Commissioner, and helping development with a good governance policy appear to be solutions that we must not disregard if we want to have a fairer and more humane immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to stress two points.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the procedure is concerned, the lack of information given to Parliament raises the issue of the role and powers of parliamentarians: it is our democratic credibility that is at stake. We complain about the rate of abstention, about the fact that Europe is an unknown entity to the citizens, we want to convince citizens of the need for the Union, but, as long as their representatives are scorned and are not consulted, we cannot make the Europe of the citizen that we want to build credible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the readmission clauses, the Union reaffirmed its commitment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions at the Tampere Summit. It is therefore unacceptable that these readmission agreements can make it possible to send back third country nationals when there is no guarantee that human rights and democratic freedoms will be respected in their country of origin. What criteria are applied in order to verify that a country to which a national is being returned is safe?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is basing its policy on respect for fundamental rights. This applies, in particular, to the measures which regulate the movement of individuals, and especially to the measures relating to voluntary or forced return. How does the Commission intend to verify that these rights are respected in case of return, particularly when it is a question of mass returns? These issues are real issues. Today, Afghans may be returned to Afghanistan despite the fact that there is no guarantee of their safety and of peace in the region. The closure of Sangatte has provided no solution to the problem of accepting refugees; Kurds and Iraqis continue to arrive every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the readmission agreements compatible with the obligations under international law, do they respect the principle of ‘non-refoulement’, on which the right to seek asylum depends? What common control mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with the countries with which these agreements are negotiated? We should like to have been reassured that these fundamental rights are being respected. In spite of the quality of the work of our rapporteur, we have no guarantee regarding these questions that are fundamental for our freedoms and our rights.</p>

<p class="contents">Excluding population pressure, political instability and regional war, it is clear that the main pressure stems from economic disparities. In short, the bulk of immigrants seeking access to the European Union Member States are economic migrants. Therefore, any successful policy must deal with not only the exclusion issues but also the causes of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Here it seems clear the European Union is making things worse. Virtually all its external policies in respect of third countries and its policies towards the candidate countries seem geared to causing migration from less-developed countries. The Union has rigid quotas, tariffs and other protectionist policies restricting trade with third countries. While it subsidies its own industries – especially agriculture through the unreformed common agricultural policy – and it dumps subsidised goods on the world market, all of this destabilises third-world economies. In terms of fishing agreements, the Union pillages third-world waters, instead of encouraging local industries. It also takes skilled, educated workers from these countries, depriving them of the building blocks of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this cruelly exposes the imperialism of the European project. Instead of getting on with practical issues, you launch upon idealistic common policies. These policies are making the problems worse. It would make far more sense to stop damaging third-country economies, rather than embarking on these extraordinary new ventures. In other words, leave immigration control to the Member States – a policy that my party supports – and address the failures of existing policies. There it seems to me, in deference to the Council member present, you must try <span class="italic">harder</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, although we are more aware of the dangers related to illegal immigration, that does not mean that the Union has practically implemented all the most effective measures for opposing it, such as, for example, readmission agreements with third countries, which must progress much faster and be much more practical, given that – as we are all aware – the Union has strong tangible grounds for putting pressure on these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the coasts of southern Italy, the flow of illegal immigrants ferried to the country by sea continues, despite the adoption of new, more stringent criminal legislation against traffickers, precisely because there has been no fall in the support or complicity traffickers enjoy in countries such as Albania or Turkey. The measures announced to combat illegal immigration include the project for a European police force to deal with all border control, not just control of sea borders, although this police force must be properly trained. This project must be given full support and pursued without delay, and proper training in this field must be given to the police forces of the new Member States, which will very soon have to address these issues – if they are not already addressing them – for their borders will become ours in this respect too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another important warning bell which it is our duty to ring too: we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to a number of proven cases of active members of Bin Laden’s network who have penetrated our cities as regular immigrants in order to prepare the ground, as has recently been discovered in France, for biological weapons attacks, possibly with what are known as dirty bombs containing nuclear waste. This danger is now present within Europe. We must take care that we do not help those intending to bring about incidents similar to those which took place in New York, Mombassa or Bali with excessively generous provision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will refer firstly to immigration. It is a good thing that it is said and repeated time and time again in this House that regulated migratory flows make a very positive contribution to the development of the receiving country, the situation of immigrants themselves and even the development of the country of origin. But it should also be repeated that the unrestricted arrival of persons in an illegal manner leads to a saturation of the structures of our societies and ends up exceeding those societies’ capacity for reception, resulting in situations of inequality and marginalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need a coherent European policy which takes account of all the elements inherent to the phenomenon of migration. The European Councils in Tampere, Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration. Nevertheless, not without reason, many people have criticised the lack of agreement in non-repressive fields, as my colleague and predecessor, Mr Watson, has said; it is true that, on the basis of such tragic events as those which take place on an almost daily basis in the waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, or on Italian coasts, vigilance, border control and the fight against mafias and exploiters of illegal workers, can and must be the response to the concerns of the citizens, who are increasingly sensitive to issues such as insecurity and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of other aspects still awaiting substantial progress. Firstly, the intensification and reconsideration of the policy of development aid in order to generate, in the countries of origin, a dignified and promising environment and thereby prevent the exodus of people – the majority of whom are young – who, rather than fleeing towards the unknown, risking their lives, could and should play an essential role in the development of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to begin work on the implementation of an observatory, which at the moment is virtual, for migration, which by means of analysis and distribution of information, would allow us to deal with the phenomenon of immigration on the basis of true facts, which are reliable and comparable between Member States, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, promoting the integration of legal immigrants, one of the keys to the success of any immigration policy, by means of measures which include family reunification, the education of children, non-discrimination, access to housing, facilities for the learning of the language of the reception country, or social or health measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in order to prevent clashes with the receiving society, and as was acknowledged at the fourth Mediterranean forum in Bari, held on 17 and 18 June, it is necessary not to forget the twin aspects of the phenomenon, that is, the need to also work to ensure the respect on the part of the immigrants for the principles and values of the society receiving them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, cooperation with countries of origin and transit in a spirit of partnership and co-responsibility, as agreed at the aforementioned forum, on the control of migratory flows, the fight against illegal immigration, the adoption of national readmission agreements and integrated management of the Union’s borders. This is a task which, in order to be successful, must be carried out in close cooperation with the third countries bordering the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">And to move on to the field of asylum, Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of, and respect for, the Geneva Convention, regulating, in a complementary manner, other necessary forms of international protection for those cases included in it. However, I regret once again to have to make a criticism, as I did when we discussed the directive, for which I was rapporteur, in relation to the conditions for receiving and asylum because, in practice, the negotiations on the different aspects of the asylum policy are still being carried out in a confused and disorganised fashion. There is a saying: ‘do not bite off more than you can chew’; and I have the feeling that this is the current situation in the field of asylum. It is also incongruous to discuss proposals which, in their provisions, depend on concepts regulated by others, the negotiations of which should have been concluded earlier, but which instead are making no progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore appeal to you to rationalise the European process, and let us not get tied up in vicious circles which are highly influenced by national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, last but not least, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the fact that, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, scheduled for 1 February, the Parliament-Council codecision procedure, and the qualified majority, will be applicable in such sensitive areas as all those which relate to the minimum standards regulating the different aspects of the procedures, requirements and conditions for asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where repressive measures, including combating illegal immigration, are concerned, the Council has once again done a lot of energetic work this year. There is, however, currently no sign of an actual common asylum and migration policy, and that is not the Commission’s fault – no, it is the Council’s fault. The Council has opted for a highly unilateral approach. It has put control of our external borders and sanctions against offering assistance to those entering and staying illegally right at the top of the agenda. The removal and return policy has now been added to this as a priority. In this context we are talking today about the readmission agreement with third countries, in this case Hong Kong. Parliament was more or less left standing on the sidelines during the negotiations for this agreement, and has not been able to act in accordance with its allotted role. This should not have been allowed to happen, particularly as this agreement will be a model for future agreements of a similar kind. I have taken note of Mr Vitorino’s promise that this will not happen again, and I intend to remind him of this. My group can otherwise live with the content of the Hong Kong agreement, but we do endorse Mr Watson’s critical approach. Leading on from his questions, I would like to make the three following comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to what extent are the deportation measures already taken effective in general, and how do we prevent people from third countries who have been deported from coming straight back into the EU countries they came from? Or is our policy of return primarily a virtual policy intended for domestic consumption, and is it supposed to mask the fact that the political courage to tackle the real problems is lacking?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, is forced return not supposed to be a tailpiece of our policy of return, a last resort, and what instruments does the European Union actually have to promote voluntary return in order to avoid forced return?</p>
<p class="contents">My last point: collective deportation is forbidden, including in the European Charter of Human Rights, but how are European Union Member States supposed to ensure that decisions to deport individual illegal immigrants from third countries are individually monitored, and how do we then prevent the principle of ‘non-refoulement’ from being violated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with that praise. However, I am less satisfied with the EU’s refugee and immigration policy. The proposals are more often than not about control and repression. The global perspective is easily lost. What is required? Well, that poverty in the world be combated and that we obtain more aid, more trade and more democracy. Mr Haarder is well aware of this. We need a humane asylum policy based on respect and human dignity. All human beings are entitled to seek asylum within the EU. Not all will have reasons for requiring protection that enable them to stay, but all must be dealt with under the rule of law and under decent conditions, as well as having, for example, access to the labour market. The fact that the EU is opening the door to immigrant labour should ease the pressure on asylum policy and, at the same time, give us an opportunity to cope with the increasing population problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the EU needs a common asylum policy is shown by the Danish example. When Denmark tightens up its policy, the refugees come to Sweden. A humanitarian EU must be able to do better. That requires codecision making in this Chamber, something of which Mr Haarder is more aware than anyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also agree with the words of Mrs Terrón i Cusi, who said that a global approach to these issues is needed. A global approach means that we need to focus on the two aspects of the set of problems posed by asylum and immigration; the causes underlying them and how we can combat their abuse. And on this point I wish to say that I do not agree with those who oppose repressive measures on the grounds that they are not necessary. Unfortunately, they are. Combating illegal immigration must be a priority for the Union, because this phenomenon represents the greatest threat to human dignity, it allows criminal networks and trafficking in human beings to flourish. Illegal immigration and our inability to control migratory flows allow people to react in exaggeratedly xenophobic, racist and intolerant ways.</p>
<p class="contents">It would probably be easier to make everything that is illegal legal, but we cannot do this. Not everyone who wishes to enter EU territory can do so. And therefore, as Mr Watson said, we must have a policy of repatriation that ensures the credibility of our immigration policy. And this is crucial and must be done without any complexes of an ideological or any other nature. What we have, therefore, is a lack of speed and a lack of balance. As to the lack of speed, I have confidence in the energy of Commissioner Vitorino; with regard to the lack of balance, I think that this Parliament will have to shift the balance of some of its positions. Concerning the wisdom of Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to emphasise something that he said and which I believe to be extremely important: on this matter we must have a policy made up of small steps; small steps, but steady ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commission itself points out, more than 90% of the world’s immigrants live and work outside the European Union, close to their countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time of the Seville European Council, we warned of the danger of making cooperation for development conditional upon the control of immigration on the part of the countries in which it is generated.</p>
<p class="contents">Development cooperation is not an instrument for resolving the internal problems of the donors of aid, but a tool for fighting poverty. The origins of migration, whether legal or not, lie in poverty, political repression and armed conflicts. These are the causes which must be combated through development cooperation, rather than using it to repress their effects.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission's desire to integrate European immigration policy is a wonderful opportunity to ensure that, instead of spending development funds on monitoring borders and the forced repatriation of immigrants, they are assigned to more constructive activities in accordance with the principle of combating poverty which governs European cooperation policy. It is a question of co-development or, in other words, contributing to the development of the areas of origin of immigrants, so that they can return with hope for the future. In this way, the Commission would be acting coherently with itself, since it states, in the communication we are debating today, that it is aware that the European Union’s relations with the developing countries must be based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement on readmission led to problems and protests. Therefore, we say yes to negotiated readmission within the framework of global development programmes, but no to forced repatriation, especially when this is paid for from development funds. We will be vigilant in order to prevent, by means of the reallocation of the scant resources in category 4, any modification of the development priorities established by this Parliament, especially given that the Commission’s report demonstrates the concern at the lack of money available for resolving this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether the position of minors, in particular, is being addressed, with regard to the right to asylum and migration issues, and if so how, and whether a huge problem known as ‘Eurocracy’ – in other words the fact that waiting times for both the rejection and the acceptance of certain applications relating to what are still extremely lengthy, complex procedures are excessively long and certainly do not respect what we call human rights – is being addressed, Commissioner, and if so how.</p>

It is high time to realise that the sacrosanct principle of laissez-faire and laissez-passer spells disaster for Europe. One European government after another has been incapable of managing the uninterrupted waves of immigrants, and the recent, highly publicised agreement between France and Britain regarding Sangatte is not going to change things. The Sangatte refugee camp has closed, that is all very well. The United Kingdom has agreed to admit one thousand illegal immigrants, but then what? What about all the others, those who were not tagged by the Red Cross, and what about the hundreds of immigrants who arrive illegally every day? Closing Sangatte without closing borders is obviously inconsistent, absurd and ineffective. It is once again a matter of urgency, as a first step as a safeguard and a precaution, to restore controls at all our national borders and to condemn the irresponsible and obsolete Schengen agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, initiatives such as the proposal for a Directive on the free movement of citizens or family regrouping, or those relating to the conditions for entry for work purposes for immigrant or third-country nationals, should be approved by this Parliament as soon as possible and with the greatest possible consensus, in order to demonstrate that we are in favour of a single immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second point, the success of an immigration policy undoubtedly depends on the integration measures which must accompany it. Therefore, reception and integration must be considered as an essential part of the general immigration policy and this means agreed action, not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of national and regional governments, civil society and the immigrants themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take advantage of the generally positive impact which legal immigrants have on our economies and ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of third-country citizens and the rights of receiving communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to support the measures of the Danish Presidency with regard to readmission agreements. I would point out that in one of the Convention’s working groups it was said that the negotiation of readmission agreements with third countries has been shown to be more effective when carried out at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the creation of an integrated system of management of external borders. In this regard, I would also praise the Danish Presidency, which wished to promote a rapid and secure exchange of information between the Member States, with a view to strengthening cooperation on the control of borders. In this regard, it is appropriate to mention the report adopted last week in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a quote from Mr Vitorino, which I have often used: ‘immigration is neither a problem nor a solution, it is a phenomenon of a clearly human, social, economic and political nature’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is it worthwhile refreshing the failing memory of our governments of Article 63 of the Treaty, which defines the process leading to the harmonisation and communitarisation of questions related to the right to asylum and immigration? I wish, for my part, to express my frustration at the pious hopes that we hear in each statement made by Council representatives on these issues, when, in reality, obviously, no EU Member State actually wishes to share with its neighbours one of the prerogatives of national sovereignty, namely the admittance of foreigners to its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the proposed measures have mainly been focused on the question of illegal immigration. On the question of establishing proper procedures for immigration, there has been a lack of consultation with the European Parliament, on the one hand, and a lack of agreement between the governments of the Fifteen on the other. After the Tampere Summit in October 1999, however, the Commission approached the task with a positive outlook. We believe that it is impossible to discuss combating illegal immigration unless we also consider proper procedures for immigration and the conditions for integrating foreigners. We need a global approach, this has been pointed out. It is essential. It is not a fortress Europe that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I shall say that the lack of political will on the part of the EU countries leads us to confirm that we still have a great deal of work to do before we achieve the European area of freedom, security and justice which was, in fact, one of the fundamental themes of the Treaty of Amsterdam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First and foremost, we should welcome the signing of the first bilateral agreement enabling illegal immigrants to return home, which comes three years after the Tampere European Council’s initial request. In reality, however, when we read the agreement’s explanatory statement, we are appalled to learn that, in conjunction with its signing, the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs have, in return, obviously, exonerated the holders of Hong Kong passports from the visa requirement. We feel that the two parallel decisions are utterly disproportionate. How many Chinese nationals are able to enter the European Union thanks to the visa exemption and stay here illegally? And how many can be returned to Hong Kong – at our expense, I might add – under the readmission agreement? We therefore feel that this agreement is, in all respects, not at all beneficial. We would very much like to know how many of these concessions might have been negotiated. In any case, it is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, that is what we have to deal with in this area in the European Union, and on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that my fellow German Members who are taking no part whatsoever in this debate have good reasons for their absence. I assume that they are celebrating the fact that, from today, Germany will no longer have a modern immigration law, because they have been successful in preventing the creation of a modern law of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I believe, is what the Christian Democrats should finally ask themselves – they should ask themselves what they think they are doing. If they were to act responsibly, they would inevitably end up sharing with us a concern that there should be a common asylum and immigration policy. But that is not what they are about. The Christian Democratic majority in the European Union has but one objective: integration and the frustration of any reasonable immigration policy.

We believe that it is possible to respect human rights while pursuing a proper policy of combating illegal immigration. However, we do need appropriate instruments, appropriate forms of control, for otherwise a blind, bureaucratic system of rejection and forced repatriation will lead to tragedies such as that which occurred recently in Italy. In Milan, a family travelling from Syria, in transit from Amman to Casablanca, was forced to be repatriated to Syria, where the head of the family was immediately arrested and is in danger of being tortured and may be sentenced to death. We call upon you to ensure that similar tragedies are avoided so that nobody can say, as is stated in the minority opinion, that the Union’s readmission policy leads to the death of human beings.

Greece’s extensive coastline forms the external border of the European Union with the countries of Asia, countries from which immigrants are now flooding into Europe, which is why it is vital that the Greek Presidency introduce a framework policy to divide obligations and responsibilities fairly between the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as other members have also pointed out, immigration policy means more than just guarding borders. It means more than repressive measures, repatriation and readmission. It also means recognising the human rights and fundamental employment and civil rights of immigrants and what they have to offer and can contribute to the development of Europe. It means fully recognising the rights of anyone who has resided in the European Union for five years, as we have repeatedly proposed here in Parliament. It also means recognising that women who have left home under the threat of religious fundamentalism or barbaric traditions and practices which clash with the modern perception of respect for human rights have a right to apply for and be granted asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not entirely understand this remark, because I was after all able to say that we have just reached agreement on the cornerstones of a common asylum policy. We have agreed on the definition of a refugee, on what is to be understood by subsidiary protection and on the directive on reception conditions, and by all accounts all this will be confirmed at a Council meeting tomorrow. In addition, we have also agreed to convert the Dublin convention into a Dublin directive. The agreement is based on the first receiving country being responsible for the first year and thereafter the country in which the person concerned has resided for five months, and if the person concerned has not resided in any country for five months then it is the country in which the application for asylum is submitted. That may sound very easy, but the opposing interests of the various countries are so enormous – depending on where they are situated in Europe – that it has been tremendously difficult to reach agreement. I believe it is extremely satisfactory than we now have agreement on these cornerstones of a common asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino and I met for the first time in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. He was the chairman and I was a member. The first thing we talked about was these things, which we wanted to lead to a common policy, and we talked a lot about Eurodac. When will it come to something, we asked the Commissioner. Now we can answer: something will come of it on 15 January, that is, next month. So I think we have achieved a great deal. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sbarbati is right that something must be done for asylum-seeking minors in particular, and I can only state that in my home parliament I have introduced a Bill which ensures that an adult is present, that a lawyer is present when necessary and that cases involving minors are processed extra quickly. Similar efforts are in progress in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mrs Ludford, I would say that if not much has come of a common immigration policy, that is partly to do with the number of work permits to be issued. Most governments maintain that this must be a national decision. This is why it has also been difficult to arrive at common rules on the right to free movement between countries. It is only natural that reaching agreement on this point is a difficult task, not least because some countries have very high levels of employment whilst others have very low levels of employment. We will probably make some progress, but as I have mentioned, it is not that easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go on to say to Mrs Swiebel that one specific aspect of the common asylum policy on which we have now agreed is that we ensure compliance with the conventions in every case. With regard to Mrs Swiebel’s concerns regarding forced returns, I believe that all the governments are doing everything to ensure that those whose asylum claims are rejected are returned voluntarily; likewise illegal immigrants, if the governments wish to return them. One cannot rule out forced repatriation, however; if we were to rule that out, we might as well pack up and forget all about an asylum policy, including a common asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding what Mrs Ludford said about women being returned to Afghanistan, it is naturally the case – as it should be – that nobody must be sent back to persecution, torture or degrading treatment. To reassure her I can state that the Afghans in most countries – this is true in my country at least – are young men from the Kabul region. Even they are not being sent back home at the moment; but it is obvious that, when this becomes possible in the spring, then it is only reasonable that, if their asylum claim has been rejected, we ensure that the person in question returns one way or another. I think it is great that Mr Vitorino has now achieved agreement in the Council not just on a general return policy, but also on a special return programme for Afghanistan. For this aspect of the matter must be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say to Mr Olle Schmidt that I thank him for his interest in Danish legislation. It already meets all the common minimum rules that we are talking about, and even goes beyond them. So thank you for your concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Approval of these instruments is very important, because it paves the way for the full implementation of the Treaty of Nice, which provides for the development of the second stage subject to qualified majority. I understand the difficulties and the reluctance that is felt on occasion, but for my part, it is very important to be able to say that we have completed, within the timeframe stipulated by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the first phase of legislative instruments in the area of asylum in order to be able to pave the way for the full implementation of the Treaty of Nice, including the integration, subject to qualified majority, of a common European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the contradiction between repressive policies and proactive policies is concerned, I feel that the Commission has strived to present a range of proposals that is balanced in both areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding, for example, the policy on return, we have financial instruments for voluntary return, which is the European Refugee Fund. We have also recently presented a proposal for the use of heading B7-667. To this end, we shall present a proposal for a legal basis which provides for the possibility of using financial resources to support the application of re-admission agreements, including forced return.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, a policy for the management of migratory flows must include, by definition, the existence of financial instruments for forced return. This is precisely why we wish to adopt common rules in the area of forced return and we wish to ensure respect for certain rules in the area of fundamental rights, within the framework of the development of the policy on forced return. In this respect, I shall respond to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and say that the Commission has no executive responsibilities in the area of return. All Member States, in applying decisions on return, are meant to respect the relevant international instruments on fundamental rights, including the non-refoulement clause. There are also legal instruments for judicial protection where the Member State breaches the rule on non-refoulement. All readmission agreements must respect the Geneva Convention as well as the principle of non-refoulement.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support Mr Watson’s approach in that we must emphasise the dimension of fundamental rights within the framework of the re-admission agreements. That is why – and if you have an opportunity, you can verify this – the Commission has strengthened the non-appropriation clause in the new mandates for negotiating re-admission agreements with Albania, Algeria, Turkey and the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the relationship between the development policy and the immigration policy is concerned, let us be clear and speak openly and honestly. It is true that the development policy deals with the profound causes of immigration, but the development policy can only bring about long-term changes in this area. It would be impossible to expect immediate effects from a sustainable development policy of the kind that we apply in our relations with third countries. That is why we must not neglect the need to take short-term measures, for example in the area of managing migratory flows of qualified workers, flows are a genuine scourge for developing world countries which are thus deprived of human resources that are essential for their development. It is this whole complex framework that we are trying to lay down in the Immigration and Development communication. I hope that we shall have the opportunity to discuss it here at a plenary sitting of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am wholly of the opinion that we must provide special protection for minors. I would also draw your attention to the fact that, in all the proposals that we have made in the area of asylum and immigration, we have introduced specific rules for the protection of minors and also of women.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I hope that we shall have the opportunity during the Greek Presidency to debate a Commission communication which is currently being prepared in conjunction with Mrs Diamantopoulou. The communication relates to the interaction between the policy on managing migration and social policy in general, and the European employment policy in particular. It will be an important time for clarifying the close relationship between the management of migratory flows and employment policy at European level, as Mr Watson highlighted so clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
