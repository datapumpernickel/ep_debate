<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cashman (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – I have the honour to present this report on a subject that is crucial to the lives of the people we represent and, indeed, to the future of the Union. My aim throughout the report has been to produce a proposal which is politically mature, eminently reasonable and practical for both the institutions and the citizen. I believe my report reflects that and the view of my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, to whom I pay special tribute.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that this is a legal text; it must be detailed and watertight. It is not an information pamphlet. That will come later. However, I regret that the report has been misrepresented by some for short-term political gain. A few cheap headlines, a few inches of print remove such people from reality. This report is even more urgent in light of the rules which were adopted by the Council in August, the so-called ‘Solana Decision’. My report specifically states that the August Decision should be repealed along with other decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeking is a change of culture. As a collection of 15 Member States we approach the issue of public access to documents differently, but I am glad to see that, largely, the European Parliament stands as a bulwark against the forces which seek to keep the doors of the institutions closed to the public. Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable and stimulates greater efficiency. I remain confident that, with the crucial input of Mrs Maij-Weggen, we have produced a mature and sensible text and introduced revolutionary changes for the institutions, but also real and tangible benefits for the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Article 255 of the Treaty permits a broader interpretation of citizens' access to documents of the institutions, so allow me to outline some of the changes in my report. All the institutions and bodies covered by Article 255 should be expressly stated in the regulation and should include not only committees and working groups, but all agencies created by the institutions. All documents of the institutions should be public unless there is good reason why they should not be – based on a harm test and on a limited number of exceptions. These exceptions are discretionary, not as others would have you believe, mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘document’ should be interpreted widely and must include internal documents of the institutions, although information documents, the ‘space to think’, can be excluded. As in the Commission proposal, a register of documents should be established. It should contain documents which are directly accessible. It should also include documents which are classified as ‘non public’ with the exception that applies. That way, the public knows of the documents and can challenge such classification. Furthermore, access to documents must be user-friendly via the Internet or traditional methods and there will be ongoing scrutiny – extremely important – of the new process and implementation by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clarify some other aspects. The classification system outlined in my report is intended to make the process of access to documents easier. An application for a document would challenge the application of the exception. At the time of the request for a document, the application of the exception must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. What we must ensure is that the existing or future interinstitutional agreements, referred to in my report, have as their legal basis the Article 255 rule in order to ensure that a coherent framework is agreed between the institutions, with the maximum right of access for the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have suggested that in my text I come too close to the Council and Commission view. In fact, the fundamental problems which the Council and Commission foresee with my report are, interestingly enough, the very same differences apparent between the majority of Parliament and some of the smaller groups in this House. Therefore, I urge the Council and Commission to embrace the change. The Union must move closer to the citizen. It must be more accountable and more transparent, especially as we approach enlargement. Together we must seize this opportunity and together solve the problems that it poses. I urge the House to support my report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it was a long time before the European Commission submitted a proposal in the field of openness of government. A number of MEPs had been asking for one for years. At the beginning of this part-session I even submitted a complete proposed initiative to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. The latter then announced that it would produce a concrete proposal within six months, and it has kept its word.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just a shame that the content was not what we had expected it to be. There has been a fair amount of criticism on the part of the journalist organisations, the NGOs, a number of Member States and also Parliament. It therefore comes as no surprise that there is a broad package of amendments, so broad in fact that the regulation is being adapted to a quite considerable extent. Adapted to the legislation on openness of government in a number of Member States, but also to the Freedom of Information Act of the kind in force in the United States. After all, why would we want to give our European citizens less openness with regard to Brussels than the Americans get with regard to Washington?</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a huge number of amendments and I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Michael Cashman, for his cooperation with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with myself. What we have before us is, in fact, the work of these two committees.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the most important amendments? The most crucial one is of course the amendment relating to Article 4, in which the Commission laid down 17 exceptions for access to documents and we managed to whittle the exceptions down to six.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, when it comes to information on military and defence matters we suggest that an interinstitutional agreement should be concluded between the Council and Parliament so that secret information can be imparted to a so-called select committee. This committee could then assess if it was right to keep it secret. In this way, Parliament would function as a link between the Council and the citizens, and that is why it is entirely appropriate that this proposal should be incorporated into this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important amendment is the proposal to have not just the Council, the Commission and Parliament fall within the scope of the regulation, but also all the external bodies. Why should we not force these bodies, which are funded by the Commission and whose staff are European officials, to adopt a culture of openness? I think that is a very important point, and a substantial annex will be appended to this regulation in order to ensure that this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to classification: in short, I completely agree with what Michael Cashman had to say. I, too, find it quite hard to understand the criticism voiced by the Liberals and the Greens because classification is exactly what we need to achieve openness. That explains why the Council has such an aversion to the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider a fifth important amendment to be that relating to the annual report, which must relate specifically to the documents that must be kept secret, or which <span class="italic">are</span> kept secret at any rate. That could be reviewed again on an annual basis in order to establish whether it is reasonable or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has advised us on an informal basis that it has not quite finished working out the position vis-à-vis Parliament. That might not be a good thing, but if Mr Cashman is of the same mind then we can consider whether it might be possible to postpone the final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, this proposal is particularly important in terms of democratic standards within the Union. That is what it is all about, i.e. the citizens, which is why I hope that the broad majority here in Parliament will vote in favour of this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, we are creating an open and modern-style administration, in which it is natural that the public should have this direct right. Obviously there have to be limits to such a right, and that is something we are also discussing today. At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation, and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years. We are not exactly starting this discussion from scratch: we can consider it our duty to see to it that transparency is increased and the criteria of the Treaty of Amsterdam are met.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction. It is excellent that the report should state that public access to documents and the obligation to release documents affect all the institutions, and not just the three main ones. It is also excellent that the institutions should be obliged, or they should be allowed, rather, to release documents also to those not resident in the European Union, or who are not citizens of the European Union. This principle should be strengthened further. Ladies and gentlemen, you can no doubt imagine that one day an EU citizen will need information, for example, on what the administration in the United States of America is doing. In fact, there is no reason for restricting public access geographically.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report does not sufficiently explain how possible separate provisions, which would remain in force at the same time as this regulation, would meet the criteria of greater transparency. This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments. As regards the definition of documents, this is a crucial question, and we could surely argue about just that for a whole year, which is probably what has happened. It is essential that scope for practising some degree of internal thought process should be allowed for the institutions, but we have to be very careful here, as we might create a situation in which documents drafted to prepare a decision may be excluded from the principle of transparency, and obviously decision-making cannot then be influenced. In my opinion, the report also goes too far in its recognition of the rights of so-called third parties to restrict the availability of documents. It may be the job of the Council and the Commission to uphold such restrictions, but I think it is not in the interests of Parliament or the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of exceptions, as Mrs Maij-Weggen said, is essential, and perhaps the most important part of this work. That aspect of the matter has made substantial progress, but I would like to focus special attention on the fact that if we want our citizens to be able to follow general developments in security policy in the future, I repeat, general, an exception regarding defence, security and military matters is much too broad in scope. It should be defined more precisely or a harm test should be attached to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the right of Members of Parliament to confidential documents is a very important issue, but it cannot replace the direct right of access to information on the part of the public. Parliament still needs to work on this report more, and for that reason I believe that it must be improved upon still here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opportunity of gaining access to public documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy, something the EU has precious little of at present.</p>
<p class="contents">International research also shows a clear connection between open administration and a low level of corruption. The Cashman report is, therefore, not just any old report. This report establishes the essence of what will become a European principle of public access to official documents, that is to say, the principle that all documents must be publicly available. There will be few exceptions and these will be clearly regulated. All documents must be registered. The documents must be examined on a case-by-case basis. If access is refused, a reason for this must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy objects to the idea that documents relating to foreign affairs and security issues will automatically and collectively be excluded from public inspection. This would be unacceptable. In this sphere, too, every document must be examined individually. We have therefore proposed, as a democratic safety valve, that those documents which – after examination – cannot be made public, could be communicated to a small group of Members of Parliament. However, it is important that this in no way replaces the desire for as many documents as possible to be made available to the public at large: journalists, interest groups and individual citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 255 of the EC Treaty concerns <span class="italic">citizens'</span> access to documents. The rights of the <span class="italic">institutions</span> ought to be developed further in separate provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cashman report is the first step on a long road towards increased openness, democracy and confidence on the part of our citizens. A common directive is necessary and important. Much work will also be needed in order to change the attitudes and the culture within the different institutions and progressively replace them with an understanding that openness is necessary, natural, effective and democratic. We now await the Council's move. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparent procedures enable the administration to enjoy greater legitimacy and to be more effective and closer to the citizen. They also provide effective protection against the arbitrary use of and the abuse of power and against corruption. These are the considerations that led the Committee on Budgetary Control to deliver an opinion under this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that the report repeats a crucial principle that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control also vehemently support. It is this: there can only be exceptions to the requirement of transparency in exceptional cases. That is why we cannot accept the long list of exceptions set out by the Commission. Here we are sending out the right signal to the citizens by radically cutting the list of these exceptions in our Amendment No 30, but, personally speaking, I find it most regrettable that we have only managed to simplify and clarify matters on this particular issue, however important it is, and not in the regulation as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the wish to anticipate any eventualities and to produce a regulation that is as complete and comprehensive as possible seems to have prevailed. Instead of a shorter text, we are therefore ending up with a longer one. I fear that will make it less legible or user-friendly. So it will become even more important for the citizen not to be left on his own with this regulation, but that each institution should establish contact points to which applicants can turn and where they can obtain practical assistance in their search for documents. If we really want to make it easier for the citizens to exercise their rights in practice, we will need specially trained staff in these contact points, who can, so to speak, take the citizen who is seeking information by the hand and guide him through the complex labyrinth of the institutions. The same applies to the use of languages.</p>

All the same, I should very much like to commend the considerable work Mr Cashman has put into this report. As I see it, it is one of the most important pieces of work done this year. The statement by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, too, in fact goes farther than the Commission had proposed. We drew inspiration from the Nordic models for transparency in administration, for the Nordic countries have a very long tradition of having the right of access to documents. Naturally enough, it has also been the task of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport to emphasise that the language in the rules must be as clear, simple and understandable as possible. In the same way, we have also pointed out that openness and transparency are the best tools for solving the problems which may arise as a result of cultural and linguistic differences between the Member States, on this issue too.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, right of access to documents is an important part of the EU’s information and communication policy. All investigations have, of course, revealed the distance between the European citizen and Brussels, and people themselves think they know too little about the EU. What they learn is at the media’s discretion or depends upon special interest groups, and they often feel powerless over and against the institutions. Now, they will be given the opportunity also to acquire some insight into circumstances which do not receive the special attention of the mass media and special interest groups and, in that way, they will be better able to participate in the open and democratic debate which is so important to confidence in the EU. I hope the Commission will make a big effort to inform people, including the man in the street, about this legislation, for the media and the special interest groups will no doubt find their own way to the documents they are interested in. I also hope that the Council and the Commission can give us a commitment today to continuing to deal with this issue in a positive way so that we might, as quickly as possible, start making the necessary changes to the business procedures in such a way as to benefit people and the image of the institutions. At a hearing in September in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we learned that it takes ten years for an administration to change mentality, so the sooner we get started the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I nevertheless think that we should emphasise that this is a question of standing matters on their heads. It is now a question of giving citizens the power to control the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Committee on Petitions, the importance of registers is mentioned. Registers are important if we are not to have a form of public access to documents that is <span class="italic">insider access</span>. The Committee would like all documents to be included, irrespective of whether they have been drawn up by the institutions or whether the institutions have them in their possession. Of course, the institutions can be given time to consider documents, but in that case it is not a question of forever preventing these documents from being released. When this time is up, it must also be possible for these documents, too, to be evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also do the balancing mentioned by Mr Cashman as rapporteur. We must always weigh different interests against each other: the interests of having a public discussion and the interests of protecting individual people, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the parties affected have rights. We wish to emphasise that these parties must have more rights than the general public. However, the issue here is the public's, not Parliament's, access to documents. The Committee on Petitions would like to see shorter waiting periods before documents are released. Time is power in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to emphasis the important role the Ombudsman has played in the progress that has, nevertheless, been made. I believe that he will also have an important role to play in the future. We would also like to underline the fact that this is not a matter of harmonising national regulations. National cultures must be able to continue, for example in the country I come from, where some time ago the whole principle of public access to official records was conceived. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The general public's right of access to the EU institutions' documents is one of the mainstays in the establishment of an open and democratic EU. Access to information also stimulates increased efficiency. This is a significant step towards a more open and more democratic EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman and also Mrs Maij-Weggen for an excellent collaboration, which has in fact created a good basis for the continued negotiations. There are no block exemptions relating to foreign affairs or security, and neither must there be any block exemptions in these areas in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of access to documents must of course include all the institutions and bodies of the EU. It is therefore extremely important that we keep a record, a register, so that citizens have a reasonable chance of seeing what documents exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Public access to documents must be all-embracing and the main and basic principle, but it must naturally be supplemented with certain well-defined exceptions. Citizens must of course be protected. The Commission suggested 16 exceptions, which we felt was far too many. We have therefore reduced them to six. Justification for a document being classified as confidential must be required in each individual case. Furthermore, confidentiality may not be assigned permanently. As soon as confidentiality is no longer justified, the document must naturally be made publicly accessible. There may, of course, be negotiation strategies whereby a document may need to be kept secret before a meeting, but once decisions have been taken there may no longer be a need to maintain confidentiality. The document should then be made available. In addition, it must be possible to appeal against all decisions relating to confidentiality. It must be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the Ombudsman or the relevant EU authority, and Parliament must always be able to question the grounds for confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important principle, which has been one of my hobbyhorses since the debate on openness began, is that, as far as possible, documents must be made available in electronic form on the Internet. This is something that Parliament has supported and will probably also emphasise again today, which is important.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard this as a very good example of Swedish and Nordic influence on the system of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increased openness will reduce bureaucracy and the opportunities for cheating and fraud and, at the same time, increase the legitimacy of the institutions among citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not get too bogged down in some of the details of the report – it is always possible to wish for more when it comes to details – but keep to the main principles. The basic principle of the proposal on our table now is that all documents must be made public. The exceptions are considerably fewer and clearer than those in the Commission's proposal. The general public is guaranteed the greatest possible access to documents and in the easiest possible way. The same thing applies to citizens in third countries. A register of all documents must be established. Requests for access will be handled <span class="italic">relatively</span> quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Those countries which have better systems will not be adversely affected, but will be able to retain their systems. Furthermore, a report must be sent to Parliament every year so that we might continually follow up this action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible. In our group, we have also discussed the possibility that the visually impaired and those with other types of functional disability should be able to receive documents in a form other than written form. I would like to draw attention to the Internet and other possibilities which in the future may facilitate access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that, in Parliament, we must be very unified in supporting this comprehensive proposal, because the problems do not lie with ourselves. It is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission. That is the most important thing, and that is the task we face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the eyes of the citizens, the European Union is a cumbersome bureaucracy that spends its time cooking up all manner of regulations behind closed doors. As a parliamentarian, I can confirm the accuracy of this impression. The Council of Ministers, in particular, is a sealed fortress. And the present legislative proposal from the Commission is no cause for celebration either. Fortunately, this Commission proposal has been heavily adapted by the various parliamentary committees, due in part to the contribution of a number of liberal draftsmen of opinions that have just spoken. The guiding principle must be that all documents are accessible, subject to certain exceptions. That is the will of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the ELDR Group feels that the proposal has been substantially improved on, but that there is still room for improvement nonetheless. I would point out that the arrangements pertaining to the registration of documents are too complex, the grounds for exceptions could be formulated better, and that non-European EU citizens have a right to openness too. The stipulations concerning the duty of the Commission and the Council to provide Parliament with information, have no place in this legislative proposal. The doctrine of political responsibility must not be confused with the citizens’ rights to openness. All in all, I call upon the Social Democrat and Conservative groups, and, of course, the others too, to support our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a word about the position of the European Commission, because I have already talked about the Council. My group and I have our doubts about the European Commission. According to reports, this regulation on public access has rarely been discussed in the college, and has been regarded by it up until now as a predominantly official matter. I am keen to hear what the Commissioner in attendance today thinks about this. If it <span class="italic">were </span>to be the case then it is a miscalculation because this is about the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens. I call upon the Commission to give its full cooperation in delivering a sound regulation based on the principle of public access subject to certain exceptions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are fewer exceptions and it gives Member States the option of retaining their own national, more far-reaching legislation. But there are also points of criticism and I would like to highlight one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It relates to the announcement in our report of the so-called ‘select committee’, the committee of inquiry. And just remember, what we are talking about here is a ‘select committee’ of the European Parliament. A small group of MEPs who may be able to gain access in the future to secret military documents.</p>
<p class="contents">My problem, and that of my group, is that this provision for parliamentarians is incorporated in a provision which should be about accessibility to the public, i.e. to the citizens. It is totally unacceptable, Mr Cashman, for us to get a good deal out of all this ourselves where access to documents is concerned, but to then leave the citizens out in the cold on that very point. I would remind you that this is not an imagined danger because Parliament has decided to lodge an appeal against the Solana decision. But at the same time, it has said that whether or not we go ahead with this case depends on the progress of the negotiations as regards the select committee. In other words, as I see it, a link has been established – erroneously so – between the rights of parliamentarians and the rights of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the rapporteurs to delete any reference to the rights of parliamentarians from the provision concerning public access to documents, and I call upon all my fellow delegates to make very sure that their interests are not played off against those of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a project which may lead to citizens being placed in a position in which they are co-players and active participants and are not just spectators or like pawns in interesting, large-scale games of chess. I therefore also think it is important that, in this report, we should concentrate on citizens’ rights. We should not confuse this issue with every other possible matter connected with the right of access to documents and we should not confuse it with Parliament’s, the Commission’s and the Council’s internal quarrels about access to documents. It is citizens’ rights we are dealing with on this occasion. I should like to emphasise that we shall, in any case, vote in favour of as broad a definition as we possibly can of what the documents in question are. There is a multiplicity of documents nowadays, and we should like to ensure that there is a high degree of access to as many different types of document in as many different forms as is humanly possible. This also means, of course, that, conversely, we want to ensure that the exceptions are as minor and as few in number as they possibly can be.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply cannot understand why, in the context of this cooperation, it should be necessary to introduce rules more restrictive than those which individual Member States can live with. I cannot understand how it can be accepted that citizens of the European Union should have poorer rights of access to documents than citizens in some individual Member States. I cannot understand why it should be more important or dangerous if something were to be leaked from this ‘Community’, as it is called, than if something similar were to be leaked from the Swedish, or possibly Danish, government. That is why I think it is so crucial that citizens’ rights should not be restricted in those Member States where there is at present good access to documentation and why I think that cooperation should instead be used to increase citizens’ access in the individual Member States and, indeed, in the European Union as a whole.

Before focusing on our concern over certain points, I would first like to state that the right of access to information should be recognised as a civil and political right. Today, as a tool to help us exercise this civil and political right, we have the Internet, a term which has a strange ring within the European institutions and which, although we are starting to make use of it, is not exploited to the full. The Internet is a remarkable tool, and it is certainly now the simplest, most economical and most easily accessible tool available. We will therefore vote for the amendments facilitating its use.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concerns are threefold: the first is regarding the common foreign and security policy sectors, but also the sectors of justice and home affairs. Access to documents is not guaranteed in these sectors and is denied not only to the citizens, but even to the European Parliament. Moreover, Parliament is neither kept formally informed nor consulted regarding fundamental documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern stems from the way the Council takes legislative decisions behind closed doors. The citizens and Members of Parliament are currently denied the right to be aware of the positions adopted by the national delegations within the Council and the way these delegations vote. If the Council of today is supposed to be a co-legislating organ, a sort of upper House with legislative power, then, logically, the Council's votes and proceedings ought to be made public. The citizens have to be able to find out how their government has voted on highly important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The third concern relates to the limited access to examination scripts from the Union's recruitment competitions. There is, in fact, a grey area which leads to incidents of discrimination and poor administration. These incidents have a direct bearing on the quality of the work produced by the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we Members of the Bonino List feel that we must not go too far and introduce extreme regulations allowing indiscriminate access to information or opinions which are of no decision-making import. Our vote will therefore be targeted at finding the right balance between the two extremes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 13 October, it was sent to Parliament, but I have only just seen it tonight. It appears from this document that, if an MEP asks for information as part of the discharge procedure, Mrs De Palacio’s employees must refuse to respond to such requests. There is only one person – the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control – who is in a position to request information in connection with the discharge procedure. This internal handbook for employees goes on to state that, if an MEP finds an interesting piece of information in a newspaper and would like to see the document concerned, then there is only one Member of Parliament who can submit such a request, and that is the President of Parliament. This is scandalous, and it shows what the Commission’s intentions were in connection with the framework agreement. If not even Members of Parliament can obtain the information they ask for, how for heaven’s sake are ordinary citizens to obtain such information? All MEPs are therefore justified in going to their groups...</p>

It is essential and fundamental to the system for the citizens to have the broadest possible access to the EU's documents. In principle this regulation is positive, especially the clarification that it covers all areas of activity and all the institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But one serious cause for regret remains. If it is applied extensively, the list of exceptions in Article 4 could totally destroy the object of this regulation. The regulation is marked by imprecision, which will produce legal uncertainty for the citizens. I consider it extremely questionable to deny access to documents where – and I quote from Article 4 – disclosure could undermine "the effective functioning of the institutions". That provision could open the door wide to arbitrariness. The concept of the "effective functioning of the institutions" is vague and inconsistent with the case law of the European Court of Justice. According to that court, the decision on whether to grant access to a document must take account of the relative interests of the institutions, the confidentiality of the document and the interest of the applicant.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that it could undermine the effective functioning of the institutions is not sufficient grounds for the denial of access to documents. This provision must be deleted or at least supplemented by the obligation to weigh up the various interests. The purpose of this regulation is to optimise access to documents while adhering as far as possible to the principle of openness. The proposed regulation can only achieve that aim if the list of exceptions in Article 4 is toned down, to say the least. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the report sends a powerful signal to all the EU’s institutions and to the general public. Openness in legislative work and in public administration is, of course, crucial to our democracies being able to function. It is therefore not enough that a system should be formally open. It must also be experienced as such. The Commission’s draft Regulation is in reality reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersen’s story of the Emperor’s New Clothes. There is a difference between words and deeds. Here in the European Parliament, we must adopt the role of the little boy in the story. The usual method of international cooperation, with all the customs and ground rules of diplomacy including the rule that everything must take place behind closed doors, will not do in the modern form of cooperation the EU has developed into.</p>
<p class="contents">We must give up this habitual way of thinking. With relatively few exceptions, documents must be fully accessible to the public. Otherwise, we shall lose people’s support for European cooperation. I might also add that, even if the rules in question only affect people in the EU, Mr Cashman’s proposal will also have a knock-on effect in the Member States where it will no longer be possible to keep documents secret on the basis of the standard justification we almost always encounter, namely that it is an EU matter. This is the attitude behind the poor opinion people have of the EU, an opinion which Mr Cashman’s report will change for the better. The report is also good for people’s confidence in European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just conclude by saying that I think it was a pity that Mr Jens-Peter Bonde had got the wrong script for his intervention today. It was not, in any case, relevant to the Cashman report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what if people are not or not adequately informed and then encounter a jungle of provisions through which not even a Member of Parliament, let alone the man in the street, could find their way? Surely information also implies that the citizens can recognise their own interests in our decisions, for instance in decisions on aid projects and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, documents are often couched in the kind of language not even a lawyer can understand, let alone a citizen.</p>

Do these institutions <span class="italic">really</span> want to bring the citizens closer to Europe? Their attitude would suggest a propensity towards the centralisation of power. Why did they opt for a regulation? Surely this is about documents belonging to the institutions? And why have access exemptions been formulated so broadly?</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is for sure, now that unanimity is no longer required in the Council, the only possibility of redressing the balance rests with Parliament. Fortunately, the Cashman/Maij-Wegen report represents an attempt to compile a document which lays down the citizen’s right to access to documents, and not the right of institutions to impose restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">But Parliament is no stranger to these little power games either. For example, the report contains amendments about the right of the institutions to classify documents as secret or public. These are amendments that are mainly geared towards increasing our own influence. But does this subject actually belong in a regulation on the right of the public to have access to documents? Besides, Parliament’s passion for regulation, as borne out by so many amendments, will result in a regulation that is difficult to implement. And bear in mind that transparency and openness, which are necessary to guarantee the involvement of the citizens, would be best served by the exact opposite, i.e. a clear and simple regulation. That is certainly what we as a Parliament should stick to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I think that he is referring to all the institutions except the Council, for the Council is a black hole in the European Union. The Council is the unknown on the far side of beyond. In my opinion, a step has been taken towards making it possible for citizens to avail themselves of their right to information and knowledge. In all probability, the advent of electronic data will eventually bring the citizen this possibility, providing information automatically without the citizens having to make an – albeit legitimate – request for it.<span class="bold"> </span>Furthermore, I feel that, as the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have requested, we also need to endeavour to outline clearly the institutional and bureaucratic stages in the process, defining the responsibilities which – rightly – still lie with the institutions, therefore without separating the different responsibilities within the organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mentioned responsibility precisely because the information has to protect the citizen from errors of public administration. If this were not so, we would merely be talking about a desire for knowledge, pure and simple. However, the citizen's right to defend himself against the public administration means that information must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: information cannot be made available, that is, the right to information, the right to protect the citizen from public maladministration cannot be provided if the procedures are not made simpler and more comprehensible, if the number and complexity of procedures is not reduced, because, although the citizens are familiar with the complex procedures, these procedures are the antithesis of transparency and deny the relationship between the citizen and the institution, which ought to serve as a channel for improving the quality of life of the citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, transparency has been little more than a much-misused slogan when applied to the activities of the EU institutions. The Cashman report with its demands is now a first, valuable step forward, although, in my view, no more than that. We Members should be more courageous. We will be setting up an inter-party and interparliamentary European transparency initiative, known in short as ETI. It will be made up of MEPs, members of national parliaments, but also media representatives, because it is important to defend ourselves jointly against the intolerable habit of secrecy in the EU institutions. It is not just a matter of the principle of unrestricted access to all documents but also, of course, of finally managing to open the doors of Council meetings, so that in future the Council can no longer take lonely decisions in camera <span class="italic">à la</span> Metternich and then go in for cheap ‘Brussels bashing’.</p>
<p class="contents">The media representatives, in particular, are warmly invited to support our parliamentarians and to work together with us so that we can find out all the things the citizen wants to know and needs to know. Tomorrow there will be a meeting in London. We will ask the British Foreign Trade Minister and the Minister for Science to show their understanding for our concern. The weekend after that, the European Council of Artists will be meeting in Madrid and there, too, ETI will feature large on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The model for us all is the American Freedom of Information Act and the living practice of transparency in Sweden. It is not just chance that we have heard almost only Scandinavians speak here, with very few speakers from Germany or Italy and, so far at least, I believe, none from France. It is fortunate that the Swedes will be taking over the presidency of the Council next year; perhaps they will be able to send out a much clearer signal. In any case, we need a new age of enlightenment and this is a great opportunity for us MEPs to show our true colours.</p>

However, he is not the only one I should like to thank, as my sincere thanks also go to Hanja Maij-Weggen, of the PPE-DE Group, who is the other rapporteur, thanks to the enhanced Hughes Procedure. I am glad that they have been able to work in close and successful cooperation in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and democracy are important values in our work, and they will come about if registers on existing information, including that deemed confidential, are made obligatory. This is the principle which I have made the starting point in my own report on the accessibility to information on the environment. It would also be important if the public were given information as to when a document, which is not available to the public at the time a request is made to examine it, because it is incomplete or confidential, will actually be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus attention on something which concerns public accessibility to documents which fall within the authority of the Commission or are in the possession of bodies set up by the institutions. These latter would include, for example, the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen as well as the Food Safety Agency, which is soon to be established. Naturally, the documents these bodies hold must unambiguously be included within the scope of provisions on accessibility. I do not think Mr Cashman’s chosen technique here is a good one, however. It is technically cumbersome to classify these bodies in a separate Annex, as new bodies are forever being created or changed. It would be better to create provisions in the paragraphs themselves, which would oblige all bodies to publish their documents and create registers on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the work on derogations. The provision of derogations is a very delicate matter, and what is otherwise an excellent report and a huge increase in transparency will very easily be overshadowed in the minds of the public by any clumsy set of provisions on derogations. Naturally we have to finally decide on the sort of practices which would shed public light on the work of the Council, and no set of derogations must be allowed to let the Council retreat behind it in the way it did before. But it is just as important to temper public opinion, which borders very much on the paranoid as a result of exaggerated secrecy with regard to documents on such matters as security and defence. In fact, it is important, as far as security is concerned, that the public can judge, using facts and documents, just how much confidence they have in European defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparency must become a founding pillar of all the work of the European Union, but the right to access documents is still not enough in itself to establish transparency. We must see to it that the work of all the institutions is based on transparency, clarity and intelligibility, and that means that the decision-making structures are clearly visible. Bureaucracy has also to be avoided here. The times being proposed for the release of documents must be absolute deadlines, because in normal circumstances documents are readily available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is very important that this report proposes a yearly review as, then, lists of documents that have not been able to be made public, can justifiably be gone through. At this stage we would also then have the chance to examine, on political grounds, whether the suppression of documents has been judged entirely appropriately. I hope that this report is received favourably here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This gap is symbolic of the distance between the European Union and its citizens. Our people regard Europe as being undemocratic, a place where decisions are taken behind closed doors. The gap is also becoming a democratic deficit in Europe. At the end of the day, exchange of information is an essential foundation of modern democracy, which is nurtured by public debate, media and public control and the contribution of social organisations. Parliament’s proposals bridge this gap. I would also emphasise that the vast majority of MEPs support the proposals, and that includes delegates whose own countries may be less familiar with the tradition of openness. I regard this consensus throughout Parliament as a great achievement, enabling us to demonstrate that this has become a Europe-wide fight for European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude that the Council committed a serious error in July when it categorically declared all documents about military affairs secret. This decision illustrates just how far we still have to go before Europe actually has a democratically controlled security and defence policy. That is why Parliament is calling for European security and defence policy to be embedded in the structures of the European Commission in future. Firstly, we must tackle the insupportable decision taken by the Council. Naturally Parliament recognises the need to keep certain military matters secret, but only if this is done on the basis of an assessment of the content of each individual document, and with the aid of verifiable criteria and procedures. Parliamentary control of secret documents could then take place via a parliamentary select committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, access to documents is fundamentally important to our European democracy. The Council and the Commission must deliver the goods with interest in the negotiations due to take place in the coming weeks. Otherwise, the Social Democratic Group, along with others, will endeavour to enforce this right to information by having recourse to the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to express my satisfaction at being able to explain to you the Commission’s position with regard to the amendments tabled by the various committees on the proposal for a regulation, a regulation which we all consider to be of great importance to the reality of democracy and progress in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say how much the Commission and myself appreciate the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, and the draftsperson of the proposal, Mrs Maij-Weggen, to present this report in such a short period of time. In accordance with Article 255 of the Treaty, the proposed regulation must be adopted before 1 May 2001, that is to say, two years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Before presenting the Commission’s position, I would like to point out that, in drawing up its proposal, the Commission based its work, on the one hand, on the experience and functioning of the voluntary code of the last six years and, on the other, on a study of the legislation of the Member States, some of which have a great deal of experience in providing their citizens access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty recognises the citizens’ right to have access to the documents of the European institutions in accordance with certain principles and conditions. As the proposal indicates, the Commission feels that providing citizens with access will mean that they are guaranteed better information on decision-making processes, and that administrations will have greater legitimacy, efficiency and responsibility in a democratic system. The fundamental principle is therefore openness, but this must be reconciled with safeguarding the public interest and respect for certain rights which warrant special protection. This is the fundamental balance that we must achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Our legislation must also respect another type of balance which is equally essential: the balance between the three institutions that are considered in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This does not mean that it would not be appropriate for the other institutions also to adopt the regulation when we adopt it. When President Prodi addressed Parliament on 3 October, he referred to the institutional triangle and stated that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the efficient functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest. Each of the institutions has a different task to perform and its needs and obligations are therefore different.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of Mr Cashman’s report we now have a clear idea of Parliament’s priorities. However, the Council’s position with regard to some of the most important provisions of the proposal is still not clear. This element of uncertainty means that the Commission, at this point in the procedure, can only offer a general position. We are therefore unable to agree to some of the amendments without prejudging a future negotiation and a definitive position in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased to see that the European Parliament agrees, to a large extent, with its view of many of the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, other amendments do not present any problems of principle. We must go further in relation to the ways in which the regulation will be applied and implemented, because openness, transparency and the provision of access to documents is an attitude which must be strengthened in our respective administrations and which must become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that many of us who are in favour of the maximum degree of transparency, which would allow the institutions to become more efficient, were truly amazed, a few years ago, to discover that, in a country which always sets an example in these areas, certain sterilisation practices had been taking place for several years, specifically in relation to certain categories of citizen, in the most shady and least transparent manner. I believe that this demonstrates that there are no perfect situations and that we all have to make progress in order to prevent situations of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the Commission from accepting certain amendments. One of them is the need to achieve a fair balance between openness and efficiency. I am referring in particular to texts for internal use and to initial drafts and preparatory study documents for exclusively internal use by the institutions. All national legislation in this field excludes these documents. Forcing institutions to publish these internal notes could, in many cases, simply lead to confusion amongst the citizens. As one Member has said, there is a paradox here, and that is that sometimes the worst type of disinformation results from an overload of information. In this respect, I believe that access to preparatory documents would not provide much information. Furthermore, an attitude such as this would discourage creative thinking and would encourage strictly bureaucratic approaches within the institutions. I believe that this is precisely the opposite of what the institutions intend.</p>
<p class="contents">I must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is the precise definition of what documents are. In this respect, I believe that we must now continue to make progress in seeking a common definition, on which all the institutions can agree. Therefore, although I cannot agree to the amendments to Articles 3 and 4 today, that is to say Amendments Nos 28 and 30, this does not mean that we do not have to hold discussions and make progress in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem lies in the treatment of entry documents, that is to say, documents drawn up by third parties. The institutions lack experience in this field, since the current system only deals with documents presented by the institutions themselves. The Commission’s proposal on third-party documents takes account of what was agreed at the last Intergovernmental Conference – in Declaration No 35 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we cannot ignore – which gives them, both the institutions and the third parties, the final word on whether to publish these documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s amendments completely reverse this approach and we therefore believe that greater consideration is required and that the proposal for a new Article 4c, Amendment No 36, is not yet sufficiently mature to be accepted favourably by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to other amendments, we believe that we need time to assess the consequences of the proposal from the operational point of view and we must ensure that the procedures incorporated are not bureaucratic, but are truly accessible to all the citizens. I include here amendments such as those tabled on measures which must be agreed by means of an interinstitutional agreement: Amendments Nos 34, 45, and 48.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out previously, in certain cases we can agree in principle to the amendments, but we have to work together from a technical and administrative point of view, for example with regard to the amendments referring to the classification of documents and the register. For several decades the Commission has had a system for the classification of documents. Therefore the principle that documents should be subject to a classification system does not raise any problems. Nevertheless, there has been no discussion as to whether or not the rules for classification should be common to all the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is premature at this point in the legislative procedure to take a position on whether there should be a direct relationship between classification and access to documents, as proposed in Amendment No 29, or whether rules to this effect should be included in the present regulation. The relationships established by the amendments between rules on classification and rules on the content of the register therefore prevent us from accepting at this stage Amendment No 46 relating to the register.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight that, at the right time, the Commission could accept practically all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18, 21 in part, 23, 25, 26.1, 28(f), 35, 38, 40.1, 40.6, 41.1, 42, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52. Furthermore, the Commission believes that we will be able to reach agreement, with some modifications, on Amendments Nos 11, 12, 40.4, 40.7, 43.2, 47, 48.4, 50.1 and 50.2. Perhaps also Amendments Nos 63, 66.2, 73.1, 74.2, the final part of 75, and 78.2.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the fact that, although the Commission is only able today to express certain global and positive approaches in certain respects, and with regard to other amendments we are making no comment or only doing so cautiously, this does not mean that we do not want to go ahead with the debate, the negotiation and the search for common ground between the three institutions. We hope to be able to work in this respect so that the appropriate regulation will be approved by May.</p>
