<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Manders (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, may I begin by thanking everyone who has contributed constructively to the creation of this compromise and the directive, which I hope, and I am almost sure, will be accepted. I would in particular like to thank the Vice President, Mr Imbeni, who headed the conciliation delegation, Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and all shadow rapporteurs, who contributed constructively to the creation of the compromise, as well as Ambassador Gunning who attended the conciliation on behalf of the Council. I would also particularly like to thank Ana Palacio, who has since left this Parliament. At the time Mrs Palacio was chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and was responsible for a unique moment in this Parliament, namely for what I call the ‘Manders procedure’. The ‘Manders procedure’ meant that the whole of this Parliament ultimately had to vote on which committee was authorised to draft and deal with this report. I found that a particular honour, and I think that it has led to an acceptable result.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we satisfied with the compromise reached? Because, after decades of debate, we have for the first time found a legal title that will enable us to ensure that the costs of repairing environmental damage can be recovered from the polluter. The liberal principle that the polluter pays is the main theme in this respect. As a liberal, I am, of course, particularly happy with this. This is new, it is the cornerstone, a bridge that connects economic and environmental legislation. I am, however, not entirely satisfied, although as I said at my press conference after the compromise with the Council had been reached, we will have to regard this as a seed that has now been sown, and we hope that it will grow into fully fledged legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening? In my view, because of the extent to which this directive 'allows', there is still a very good chance that we will create a kind of patchwork quilt in Europe and that the Member States, particularly in more economically difficult times, will find the economy more important than environmental protection. I therefore regret that my ultimate proposal to apply Article 95, maximum harmonisation, has not been adopted and that we have taken Article 195 as the basis. The environmental organisations, the environmental NGOs, played a particular role in this. They are not complaining that there will be too little harmonisation, and during the procedure they did not support maximum harmonisation, something which I deeply regret. On the other hand, Europe was obviously not ready for that. This is also evident from the conciliation procedure, because only four amendments to the Community point of view were adopted in Parliament. Only four! For this we had to convene three more conciliation meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, I believe that the compromise can be described as successful. This was also evident in the outcome of the vote in the conciliation delegation from Parliament, because 12 to 1 in favour of the result achieved is of course fantastic. I hope that this is the beginning. I also hope that the Member States will not abuse their licence policy and the state of science in order to upset the level playing field for economic activities, which we are after all so keen to create in the internal market, by some Member States allowing more than others and doing nothing to benefit the environment. On the other hand, certain benefits have already been achieved. For example, the maximum liability amount in the IMO Convention has been increased from 50 million to 1 billion. The preventative effect of the directive has thus already proven its worth. I hope that Euratom will follow very soon, and I think that this will ultimately result in excellent legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we have made a start, and I hope that this will result in something good. I would like to wholeheartedly thank the Commissioner. It was of course one of her top priorities, and she can now conclude this theme as part of this mandate. I would therefore like to wholeheartedly thank her, her staff and, in particular, Charles Pirotti, who is also present today, for their constructive contribution to this matter. I would like to invite the Commissioner to lunch or dinner, as her busy schedule has prevented us from giving a joint press conference. Perhaps this is a good idea, because by way of this invitation I would very much like to explain my thoughts on how I would like to see this directive grow into fully fledged legislation in the future, and in particular my thoughts on my EMAS (Environmental Management Assessment). I would very much like to speak to her about this and I therefore hope that she will take me up on my invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps there will be time for a quick beer after this debate. Thanks again to everyone, and I hope that a full majority will accept this proposal tomorrow. Thank you most kindly, Mr President, and thanks to everyone concerned for their constructive contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time I have had an offer of a date through the European Parliament plenary, or at least an invitation to a drink. Thank you for that, Mr Manders, and thank you for your good work on the environmental liability file! You are absolutely right that we have been waiting a long time for this to come true.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee under the chairmanship of Vice-President Imbeni, because the positive spirit which animated Parliament's delegation throughout this conciliation enabled us to find a satisfactory overall compromise: the joint text before you today, which has been approved by the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this new directive, a comprehensive framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability will be put in place for the first time. This new system will be a valuable benefit for the citizens and the environment of an enlarged Union. I am very pleased with the result that has been achieved by the co-legislators. We all wanted this directive to be an ambitious and workable piece of legislation, and finding a balanced compromise in such a technically complex and politically sensitive subject was certainly not easy. I think that the text before you will constitute a significant step forward towards better environmental protection in Europe. The contribution of this new directive to the conservation of biological diversity in Europe, through its application to protected species and natural habitats, is just one example of the many gains made possible by this directive.

<p class="contents">This House has been working on the environmental liability directive for a long time, and it has been the subject of major and lively debate. Many of its critics were already sceptical that the directive could be adopted before the elections or enlargement. I am all the more glad, as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that tomorrow’s vote will make it possible for the directive to become a reality – and I hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt what the conciliation procedure has produced.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a great day for environmental protection in the European Union. This directive will, for the first time, introduce compensation for damage to protected species and habitats – what is termed purely environmental damage. Moreover, there will, for the first time, be one system of liability for the whole Community, doing away with liability loopholes whose closure was long overdue and thereby benefiting the environment, so my group very definitely welcomes the outcome of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does, though, also see it as important that the conciliation procedure has produced a proportionate result, for the fact is – to use an adage quoted in the first-reading debate by Lord Inglewood, who will speak later – that the better is the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me pick out one point that was at the heart of the debate until very recently, and which can be taken as representative of the directive’s many crucial issues: is there, or is there not, a mandatory financial security regime? My group has always rejected compulsory insurance of this kind. There are still simply insufficient reference data for a system of this sort. The purely environmental damage to which I referred at the outset cannot at present be calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Council and the Commission, the Conciliation Committee addressed these misgivings, with the result that insurance will not, at first, be mandatory. Instead, the Commission is urged to submit an evaluation report six years after the directive’s entry into force, and then decide on any new approaches that are appropriate. I see this as the right way ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I may conclude by saying this on behalf of my group: let us join together in adopting what has come out of the conciliation procedure and thereby improve the protection of the environment in the European Union in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see that as the reason why we achieved such a very good outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, though, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we Social Democrats are less than enraptured by the outcome; we would have liked the ‘polluter pays’ principle to have been enforced with much greater rigour, along with a mandatory and immediate financial security regime, but it was not possible to get that through the conciliation procedure, quite simply because the majorities in this House are not what they need to be if that is to be done – with consequent effects on the lawmaking process. The Group of the Party of European Socialists will nonetheless be voting for the compromise, for some of the things we have managed to achieve can be described as first steps in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, for a start, managed to require the Commission, within six years, to submit a report on the availability of financial security provision, and what is very much of the essence is that it has undertaken to respond to the House’s concerns by presenting proposals for a system of harmonised mandatory financial security instruments. I do not think we would be able vote in favour had it not done so, and another reason why I see this as important is that it would not merely leave it to the market to develop a single European system of provision for financial liability; instead, from the very outset, one would be given shape and guided in a proper direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why we will be voting in favour is that this House will be able to get the Commission to examine to what extent limited liability, as provided for in international conventions, is at present possible when goods are transported by sea. This report is also to examine the relation between the liability of shipowners and the contributions of those who buy crude oil, for calamities such as the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>make it necessary that we again rethink the arrangements for liability at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up by saying that we are not entirely satisfied with what has been achieved, and we would have liked much more. I can see Mr Manders nodding; he too, I know, would have liked more, but that was not possible. This, then, is a first step, and we will, in future, be persistent in seeing to it that it is followed by more as we move towards the right solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that it has been very difficult to bring this very important Directive to fruition. At all events, we now have a draft on which to vote tomorrow, and I and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance shall be supporting it.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that we are completely satisfied with the result. The ‘polluter pays’ principle is excellent. It is also excellent that we now have a harmonised system of liability to prevent environmental damage and ensure that the damage already done is remedied. As Mr Manders said, Europe had not been properly ready for it; at least, parts of Europe may not have been ready for it. There was a good number of us that wanted a more harmonised system, and we could have gone a little further than this. After first reading we were very content, but after second reading we were no longer so content. Now we have a compromise that we can live with, and it is a good thing that something has been achieved, after all.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that the Commission should present a report after six years on the mandatory financial security instruments, in particular, is incredibly important if these are to function at all. One way of reaching a compromise at the final stage is through a declaration by the Commission, in which it makes clear that it intends to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council. I am not sure whether such a declaration would be binding, but I hope so, so that we do not drag our heels for these six years. I hope that this does effectively apply. Perhaps Mrs Wallström could tell us something about the legal status of this type of declaration? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To use an English cricketing metaphor, it is important to deal with these kinds of issues in a pragmatic way and to 'take it in singles', to move one step at a time in order to try to ensure that the way in which we deal with the kind of pollution problems that this directive is supposed to deal with actually works.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly it is important to make sure that pollution is not generated in the first place. I am not sure how much that has to do with the apportionment of the way in which liability arises if pollution does occur. If it occurs then we need to see how it is dealt with. As other speakers have said, the polluter-pays principle must be the right one. On the other hand, if one defines the polluter-pays principle, it is important that one does not just cast about to find some wretched victim who may have had some kind of association with what happened and heap all the liability on to him. Perhaps that is why we disagree with some of the other speakers in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I can envisage circumstances where it is right and just that the government has a role, where pollution has taken place, and where it may not be appropriate to put the blame or impose the responsibility for what occurs on some other party.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is important in the context of the politics of this kind of debate not to have a knee-jerk reaction to any particular pollution incident in the recent past. We often hear mention of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. Of course that was a disaster, but when we are thinking about general rules against general problems, we must not be too specific. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive represents a step forward in principle, but not in practice, because its application by the Member States has a time limit of three years, the possibility of examining an obligatory insurance system is left for a period of six years and there are provisions which will not enter into force for nine or ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">This at a time when these types of accident are happening constantly. Specifically, in the field of responsibility for damage caused by ships and other things, there are international conventions which limit the responsibility of shipowners.</p>
<p class="contents">From a practical point of view, therefore, Community citizens are not going to see any difference now nor for many years to come. This is a beginning – Parliament has been very cautious in accepting it in order to maintain the commitment of the States – but we must be completely realistic: there is no real progress here. Accidents will continue to happen, causing immeasurable damage which is not insured, there is no way of obliging the shipowners or other sectors creating risks to take responsibility and there could be cases of regions, such as mine for example, which lives exclusively from its coasts, being faced with an oil slick which entirely wrecks the activity of the region without the possibility of receiving compensation nor of damage being covered by an insurance system. That is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, however, this Parliament, in fulfilling its responsibility – which seems excessive because, since Parliament has codecision powers, it appears to be characterised by a high degree of responsibility – has preferred to suffer slings and arrows in order to accept the compromise – I would not call it a compromise, but rather a diktat – imposed by the Council and the Commission and, to ensure that the proposed Directive can go ahead, has accepted these conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this task, Mr Manders has done everything he could. We are left with just a few verbal commitments. Let it not be said, however, that we or the electors have been deceived: this is just the beginning. Let us hope that the Commission does not wait for these long periods of three, six, nine and ten years, but that within a short space of time – probably as a result of another great accident, which will cause enormous damage in any part of the European Union, whether it be in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the North Sea or any other place – it is obliged to present us, and to do so quickly, with a proposal which changes this and allows us to move ahead with much more precise rules. Another issue which must be clarified is whether a Directive is the appropriate instrument or whether we need a Regulation which makes this type of rule obligatory, without waiting for the States to slowly fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would remind you that, in the Convention’s draft of the new constitution for the European Member States of the EU, we undertake to implement a policy intended to secure social, economic and environmental development on a sustainable basis. In that the environmental liability directive deals with the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, I see it as a logical consequence of our commitment to the European model of the environmentally responsible market economy, and so I very much welcome the fact that the polluter pays principle will apply from now on, and that businesses or other operators will be obliged to prevent damage to the environment and, where they have caused any, to repair it themselves or bear any necessary restorative costs. Reference has already been made to the evaluation process and to the agreement that has been reached to the effect that preventive and restorative work has to be carried out in close consultation with the operators.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two flies in the ointment that I would like to mention; one is that this directive does not deal with nuclear liability. We find it incomprehensible that the polluter must be held liable for any environmental damage done by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, but not, according to this directive, when such pollution arises from the operation of nuclear power plant.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Member States to ensure the exclusion from liability of normal operation permitted by the authorities and development risk, to neither of which it has as yet been possible to secure an explicit reference in law. We endorse the joint text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am bound to remark, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that the decision that our committee should undertake this work, much contested by colleagues in other committees, has been more than amply borne out in the practical and pragmatic response that we have had, and I think we have a workable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as a number of colleagues have said – and this is a time for looking forward rather than backwards, because we have the agreement on the table – there is a lot of work to do to establish the clear responsibilities with organisations and to ensure through the so-called competent authorities in Member States that companies' operating processes and anyone involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities are fully aware of their potential responsibilities under this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to encourage the Commissioner – who, I hope, will leave something in place as part of her legacy as five years as Commissioner – to start to encourage Member States to exchange practice, firstly, about how they are going to establish their competent authorities or, indeed, how they are going to allocate responsibilities to existing environmental agencies that many of them have already established; and to establish the sort of networks of sharing of best practice that we are seeing in a number of other pan-European regulatory environments, such as energy and communications. There seems to me no reason why that process should not start at once, and also why communications to affected organisations should not also start.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, as a number of colleagues have said, has a very slow-burning fuse to it. Member States have quite a generous three-year timescale. There are also long timescales before review. However, if, as we all believe, prevention is what we are after – rather than clearing up damage afterwards – we need to start action straight away and there is no excuse for delaying on that. So I welcome the agreement. However, this is only the start and I am sure – and hope – that the Commissioner will leave that structure in place for us to follow through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted to answer Mrs Schörling directly because the Commission statement about looking at the financial security again in 2006 is not formally legally binding, but you might call it politically binding. I hope that means as much as if it had been legally binding. It is an obligation and a commitment from the Commission so, of course, we will have to come back on this. I am sure we have only seen the beginning. It is so important, for the reasons you have all mentioned. Thank you again, and all right, I will come for a drink!</p>
