<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simitis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am both honoured and delighted to be here today, in my role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to present the priorities of the Greek Presidency. As chairman of various Councils in the past, I have been involved in proceedings with the European Parliament and have appreciated at first hand how useful and indispensable this dialogue is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency plans to cooperate with Parliament to the maximum possible extent at all levels. It plans to cooperate not merely as a formality, but because cooperation is, I believe, a necessary and fundamental factor in achieving our joint objectives. We shall grab every possible opportunity for fruitful cooperation between us. Greece is one of the countries which believes that developing the European Union will help to strengthen the role and authority of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic phase in the ongoing development of Europe. All of us, the Council, Parliament, the Commission and our citizens, are expected to help with this phase. To support the move towards European integration, to a Europe of the 25 and/or more Member States, a Europe constructed and developed on the basis of our common values, the values which have informed our actions over the past fifty years. A Europe which creates the potential for everyone to grow and prosper, which strengthens every country’s society, and which promotes cohesion and solidarity. A Europe which, in a multipolar global system, works for peace, cooperation and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Working in this direction is not our only responsibility. It is important that we make these policies convincing, that we convince people that the Europe we are building is focused on caring for its nations and citizens and ensuring that everyone shares a common future in a community of values.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency’s programme has not been planned solely to meet the challenge of the ongoing development of Europe; it has also been planned to meet the challenge posed by today’s international economic climate, the global recession and all the sources of insecurity waiting to ambush our societies: the lack of competitiveness and stability in the economy, unemployment, social exclusion and so on and so forth. We need to respond to this insecurity with decisive action, to hit at the heart of individual and collective insecurity and to create a more rational, a fairer and freer living environment which offers everyone more opportunity. At the same time, we need to turn our attention to the international crises that create insecurity. International crises which originate in the fragile states on the fringes of the Union, international crises rooted in the Middle East, international crises caused by international terrorism. What we need is a Europe which has a constant presence and speaks with one clear voice on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, under the decisions taken in Seville, we were required to plan the Greek Presidency in collaboration with the next presidency, the Italian Presidency, so that an annual operational action programme could be formulated. We did precisely that and I should like to comment on our five main sets of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that our first priority post Copenhagen is enlargement. We need to continue with all the basic, procedural arrangements so that the accession treaties can be signed in Athens on 16 April. Your role is paramount in these arrangements because the European Parliament has to assent to the accession of the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we shall continue negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in application of the new pre-accession strategy for these two countries. Our aim is to keep to the timetable for their accession in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall be actively working on Turkey’s progress towards accession. Greece believes that Turkey should take its place in Europe on the basis of the decisions already taken by the European Councils. We must give Turkey the opportunity to carry out the reforms its country needs. That is why the Copenhagen European Council decided to follow a strategy, a plan aimed at starting accession negotiations with Turkey. The next two years will be crucial here. Greece, both as the country holding the presidency and as a Member State, wants to help with this new process, which is why one of our objectives is to draft a new partnership agreement with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We also aim to develop relations with the countries of the Western Balkans, so that they can join the process and accede to the European Union at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment at this point on the question of Cyprus. We want Cyprus to join the European Union as a united country. We want it to overcome and resolve its political problem. We want the two communities to share a common future and enjoy the benefits accession has to offer. We felt right from the start that the Annan plan gave Cyprus a chance to resolve its political problem. We have been working along these lines and we hope that a solution will be found by 28 February. Whatever happens, Cyprus will accede to the Union, as agreed in Copenhagen, although the way will still be left clear for the Cyprus problem to be resolved and the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>to be applied to the whole island.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second priority is to reform the European economy and promote social cohesion. The spring summit in 2003 will be held in a political and economic climate beset with both problems and opportunities. The introduction of the euro last year was an historic process. We believe that, although progress has been made, the Lisbon strategy is now more topical than ever. We need to implement the economic decisions taken over recent years which we have not done enough to promote. This is a vital opportunity to update the European economic and social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we shall be working on six issues. First, macro-economic policy; we want a reliable European economic policy, an intergovernmental economic policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to create more and better jobs. This will help to consolidate social solidarity and cohesion. It is important that we review the European Employment Strategy and a debate on the subject will allow us to make more of the social pillar in the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third aim within the Lisbon framework is to encourage entrepreneurship and support small enterprises. The presidency sets great store by support for entrepreneurship, which is important to economic development, not to mention employment and regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fourth aim is to build up the European economy of knowledge and innovation, because we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless we develop knowledge and technology. As you all know, a number of issues are still pending, such as the Community patent, and we intend to try and wrap them up.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will also be tackling other issues, such as developing research in cutting-edge technologies, including defence research.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fifth aim is to improve links within Europe, by which I mean full and operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets, extending the trans-European energy and transport networks, promoting the single services market and unifying the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Our sixth aim is to safeguard future prosperity through sustainability. This mainly means reviewing the Union’s strategy on sustainable development in the light of the outcome of the world summit in Johannesburg. We want to make more of the Union’s leading role in environmental protection. So much, ladies and gentlemen, for our second set of priorities which relates to the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third set of priorities covers the sensitive issue of immigration, illegal immigration, external borders and asylum. We all know that immigration in one form or another has now taken on such proportions that we are forced to act. And we need to act in two directions. We need to ensure that the Union becomes a genuine area of freedom, justice and security for its citizens, free from any form of organised crime, xenophobia and racism. That it becomes a multicultural area of understanding for man’s problems, that we fight the causes of problems such as poverty, falling living standards and political suppression. We hope here to adopt directives on the reunification of families of long-standing immigrants. In the asylum sector, we want to push ahead with directives such as directives on refugees. The second strand in our action on immigration will be to protect the Member States of the European Union from illegal immigration, share out the costs of protecting our common external borders more equitably, promote repatriation policies and speed up negotiations on readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fourth set of priorities concerns a matter which has already taken up a great deal of our time and energy. The future of Europe. We believe that the enlargement of Europe should go hand in glove with greater European unification. Our institutional system needs efficient, democratic functions and policies which reach our citizens. The question is: what route will the Convention on the future of Europe take and how will this fit in with the work of the presidency? As you may remember, the Copenhagen European Council decided that the Convention should complete its work before the European Council in June and that, at the spring European Council, we should focus on the institutional aspects of the future of Europe. So we hope to achieve three main objectives at these two Councils:</p>
<p class="contents">First, we want to carry out a review without taking any decisions, because that would prejudge the outcome of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we intend to hold a substantive debate on the outcome of this work at the June Council and set the starting and/or the finishing date for the work of the new Intergovernmental Conference, because some Member States have already expressed a wish for an interim period and we will need some time between when it starts and the June summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to lay down the remit for the Intergovernmental Conference; in other words we need to be prepared at the end of June for subsequent procedures as and when they start.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fifth set of priorities concerns the Union’s international profile and strengthening its role on the international stage. The European Union has proceeded in leaps and bounds with its common security and defence policy. What we now need is to ensure that we have full operational readiness in the crisis management sector by developing our military and non-military capabilities. We therefore intend to concentrate on achieving the general military objective and finalising permanent arrangements for collaboration between the ΕU and ΝΑΤΟ. We are keen to ensure that European operations in Bosnia Herzgovina and the FYROM, which will be the first field test of the European Union's operational readiness, are properly prepared and executed. Over and above this defence policy, we need to examine relations with the Union’s neighbours in order to ensure that no new divisions are created. A summit meeting with Russia is scheduled to take place in St Petersburg in May, attended by the countries of the Western Balkans, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and the Mediterranean, and we shall be attaching great importance to Mediterranean cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We may have to deal with war with Iraq over coming months. We hope not. We want peace. However, we are giving this issue our utmost attention, and rightly so; it is one of our priorities. We want to work and we shall work for peace and a peaceful resolution to any differences. We trust efforts by the UN will have a positive outcome. The will and the resolutions of the United Nations must prevail.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Iraq has to respect and apply Security Council resolutions. The presidency wants to speak for Europe as a union of countries with a common, strong voice and opinions. Safeguarding international stability, wiping out the threat of weapons of mass destruction and peace are common virtues; they are what we are all striving towards and the countries of the European Union need a clear common policy along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need to break our old habit of having different countries saying different things and seeking different objectives. It is not easy but we must fight for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to finish by commenting briefly on two or three matters of particular interest to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the status of MEPs. A great deal of work has been done and we have spent a fair amount of time discussing this. I think this issue is ripe for a final solution and we shall endeavour to reach a solution at the European Council in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the interinstitutional agreement on improving European Union legislation, which has done a great deal to improve the quality of legislation. We hope that there will be agreement here too during our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and lastly, we shall endeavour to complete the rules on European political parties, which are well overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have commented on a number of central issues, although there are a great many other important issues. There is too little time to talk about the review of the CAP, the development of the European defence industry or measures on safety at sea, which many of us are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the Greek Presidency to give extra momentum to the development of the Union. We want to strengthen every aspect of the Union and convince our citizens that Europe is close to them, that it embraces them all in a society of values and that it offers everyone a common future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I look forward to the best possible collaboration with you. The success of the presidency depends on it. The success of the European Union depends on it. So let us put our heads together and deal with the problems.</p>

<p class="contents">This coming year will in many respects be equally crucial. In 2003, we will have to prepare to implement enlargement and we will have to carry out the institutional reforms. Above all, we must provide the new Europe with much more solid economic and social foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, in setting its priorities for the first six months of the year, the Greek Presidency has shown that it is keenly aware of the major challenges before us. This was clear throughout your speech. There is absolutely no need for me to go over the main points again – we fully endorse them: the intense focus on immigration, patents, energy and the major obstacles to lasting peace in Europe – the Balkans question and the Mediterranean question.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus closely on these last two issues because the Balkans are a European Union issue – they are our responsibility and in our hearts – and, in the situation described by Prime Minister Simitis, whether the future holds peace or war depends on the Mediterranean. I also endorse the far-reaching decision by the Greek Presidency to choose peace: I endorse it and I call for unified peacekeeping measures from the countries and the European institutions. Before us is a unique opportunity, a huge presence of European countries in the Security Council, a European Presidency, and, most importantly, we have a public opinion which is deeply disturbed and concerned to see what war might involve and, in particular, what the consequences of war might be. The European governments may have had their disagreements and different perspectives in recent months, but their citizens are closely united in the desire to avoid war as far as possible. Of course, this does not mean that they do not have an equally strong desire to combat terrorism, to present a united front before this new threat. However, war is considered to be the last resort and our peacekeeping measures must therefore be strong and unified. We therefore feel that we are in complete harmony with the Greek Presidency and its programme for Europe, both as regards its intention to develop the work that needs to be done within the institutions on matters such as the Members’ Statute and the issue of rules on parties and as regards the two major themes which were at the heart of Prime Minister Simitis’ speech, enlargement and unification: we want a wider Europe but we also want a more unified Europe. There can be no objection to that and there is no need for clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention briefly the fact, following on from what<span class="bold"> </span>Prime Minister Simitis said, that the Spring Report, the Commission’s contribution to the work of the Spring Council, was adopted by the institution today and will therefore play a major part in the work of the Greek Presidency. We also adopted a number of related documents, most noteworthy being the report on the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the general principles of a new European Employment Strategy. I would like to thank the Greek Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, wholeheartedly, for she really has done some absolutely first rate work in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to tell you a little more about the key points of the Spring Report, although the Commission is, as always, at Parliament’s disposal should it want to organise specific debates on these important issues. The Spring Report is a general report which does not just outline our programme but enters into specific aspects of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy seeks to achieve far-reaching economic and social renewal by the end of the decade and will be the right course for an enlarged European Union too. That means – and we must not forget it – that it does not lose any of its value with enlargement but actually becomes more important. It is the best way of delivering what concerns our citizens most – greater prosperity, better jobs, greater social cohesion and a cleaner, sustainable environment – and it is the only way of making sure that these are achieved sustainably for future generations too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spring European Council must drive forward this process in the face of the two-fold challenge of enlargement and, in particular – and this is the real problem – the continuing deterioration of economic conditions. We must not be discouraged by these challenges. Quite the opposite: they must spur us on to greater endeavours, for the Lisbon agenda is the best way to integrate the new Member States and boost the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process is already starting to bear fruit. In many areas, reforms are already generating growth and jobs but, and I tell you this frankly, ladies and gentlemen, much of the European Union’s production potential continues to remain untapped. The Lisbon objectives are still within our reach, but if we do not display much greater political will from this moment onwards there is no firm guarantee that we will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">This time last year, I laid stress on the unsustainable delivery gap between agreement on policy and action to turn policy into legislation. Thanks to the combined efforts of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, this gap has now been reduced. However, a similar gap is now forming in the area of the transposition of Community directives and decisions into Member States’ law. Thus, the problem of the practical implementation of these decisions is still partly to be resolved. Moreover, many of the national policy reforms which are necessary for the achievement of the Lisbon objectives still remain to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is encouraging to see that there are Member States meeting and even exceeding many of the Lisbon objectives. These countries are a benchmark of world-beating performance and prove that the right policy mix can bring development on all fronts: economic, social and environmental. Progress has not been uniform throughout Europe, however. The unsatisfactory performance of some countries is holding back the overall development of the Union. This is why coordination at Community level is vital to encourage all the Member States to work towards the objectives that are in their own interest as well as in the interest of all the other Members of the Union. They will all benefit from macroeconomic stability, growth, more jobs and social inclusion. The Commission’s proposals for strengthening the coordination of budgetary policy and the proposals on the employment strategy point the way forward, and I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency shares this commitment and is determined to play its part fully. We will make a good team.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon strategy is an integrated strategy for sustainably boosting the European Union’s economy and meeting the major medium and long-term challenges before us. This is why, today, in the context of our strategy, I want to highlight the importance of investment in knowledge and innovation. We have made it our priority for this year. In addition to a list of things to do, with which we are all familiar and of which everyone is quite aware, there are moments when some factors assume more importance. I believe that, this year, knowledge, innovation, research and education are the genuine top priorities in a European Union which is lacking in human resources, which are falling in number, and which needs there to be an improvement in the quality of these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that this observation is a result of an analysis of the policy – implemented, in some cases against their will, by some of the Member States as a result of the restrictions – to reduce, in accordance with budgetary requirements, in some cases even because of the limits we ourselves have imposed, research expenditure first of all. If we look at the policy of many of the Member States, this has been the result, with a shift away from the 3% we set out in the major objectives of the Lisbon process. We must not make this mistake: we must help each other to avoid making this mistake. I am speaking so emphatically, if you will, because remarkable things are happening in the world. Asia’s capacity to absorb new technologies, the growing dynamism of the international markets, the market shares of many European countries which are eroded every year: all this means that the problem facing us is no longer theoretical but a question of our future survival, of the future balance of our economy, of preserving our wealth. Thus, knowledge and innovation are the driving force of sustainable development. Without investment and innovation, we will not achieve growth and we will not be able to maintain our present levels of prosperity. Many things are necessary: computers in our schools, lifelong learning, skilled, flexible employment. It is vital that we promote research into world-beating products and clean technologies, and we must help businesses turn knowledge into commercial opportunities. In my opinion, it is at precisely this last step – converting discoveries into innovation and exploiting them commercially – that European businesses fall down.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Union has made progress towards a knowledge-based economy and an analysis of the past three years is not discouraging, the fact remains that others are moving even faster and it still lags behind its main international competitors in terms of investment and performance. We still have far fewer researchers than the United States or Japan. Levels of public expenditure on education and research and development vary too greatly throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses need a dynamic environment that will stimulate this economic activity. Today, in Europe, such conditions are not widespread enough. Significantly and surprisingly – and I will give you just one statistic for this is not a theoretical discussion: we are here to take decisions – our largest companies are carrying out 40% of their research activities outside the Union. A startling figure. This is critical, for it means that researchers and resources are staying outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we must invest in the future. We must be better coordinated and set more ambitious national targets in the fields of education, research and innovation, and we must do more to share our best practices. The accession of the candidate countries with their strong skills base will offer the Union enormous opportunities. Great emphasis has been placed on the fact that, after enlargement, these countries – those which have actually entered, having been given the political green light – will make up 20% of the population but only provide 5 or 6% of income. Yet this represents a 25% increase in applied<span class="bold"> </span>scientists and engineers. In many cases, they are working in specific sectors, but once part of the European circuit, they will genuinely be able to give us great impetus. We must therefore make sure we are ready to absorb these human resources, to put them into circulation, to ensure that they become an active part of our economy. In this connection, the Commission will be launching an action plan for research and development. We must also as a matter of urgency address the matter of the legislative and administrative framework for the business world.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I would like, if I may, to make another personal observation. We can devise all the Lisbon processes we like, but if Europe does not become the centre of attraction for young talent, for the whole world, we will never achieve economic and scientific leadership. The United States are succeeding by using human resources from all over the world. Whereas our young people, who are going to the United States in ever-increasing numbers, stay there for the most part, I can tell you that the majority of Asians and Chinese – and there are currently tens of thousands of Chinese studying in the United States – go back home. Well then, if we do not find a way of inducing our young people to return home, if we do not build some large, top-level schools of excellence which are the symbol, the attraction of the future, which convey the impression that we are working for the future, we will never attract the young people, the best brains from the other continents, and we will never succeed in getting our own young people to stay in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the crucial challenge, and this is why the Commission and I personally have called strongly for this matter to be taken up, as it must be, at the level of all the European countries, for if our young people are leaving Europe, if the situation is such that our businesses are setting up research laboratories outside Europe, particularly in the United States, I warn you that our horizons will become narrower and narrower, I warn you that, if we go on like this, all will be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have clear responsibilities towards our present and future citizens and towards the whole world in this field. We set ourselves the target of creating a competitive, knowledge-based society based on sustainable growth. On our success will hang the future of the European social model too. We do not believe we can achieve the goals Commissioner Diamantopoulou and I set ourselves so carefully, the goals behind all politics such as social equality and class promotion<span class="bold"> </span>– we do not believe we can do it without a knowledge-based society. It will also, therefore, determine our ability to honour the international commitments we made at Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg and to implement policies which can secure peace and stability in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, time and time again, the European Union has confounded the most sceptical critics with bold, resolute initiatives. We have achieved many goals and I know that we will continue to do so in the future, but I implore you to understand that this matter of centres of scientific excellence, of a research effort, of rules to attract laboratories, the centres of innovation, to Europe, of becoming once again the catalyst and centre of culture and science, as Europe has always been throughout the centuries, is vital for our future. Quite frankly, the present generations have fewer opportunities, fewer options than most of us sitting here had. I believe it is our duty to restore to them these options, these opportunities, for they are entitled to them and we need them too.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, wishes the Greek Presidency every success ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: No, I said you were the bourgeois party ...</span></p>
<p class="contents">Look, whenever Mr Cohn-Bendit butts in, we lose time for debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you every success, and you will find in us a very fair partner. I want to make it clear that I say this with the agreement of our Greek friends, and Mr Trakatellis will speak immediately after me. We think it is particularly splendid that the treaty with the countries that are to join the EU should be signed, on 16 April, in front of the Acropolis or in its immediate vicinity, that being a symbolic expression of the fact that it is at the site of democracy's foundation, Athens, that we are giving the green light to the membership of the Central European countries that have achieved democracy after the horrors of the Communist era, and before that, the years under National Socialism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are of one mind with you as far as a peaceful solution to Cyprus is concerned, and also as regards the pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania, and we have an urgent request to make of you in connection with the Balkans. Whilst sharing your belief that these countries must have the prospect of joining the European Union, we must always affirm – and you yourself used the word ‘later’ – the long-term nature of that prospect. For the people of the European Union will first have to cope with the accession of ten countries, to which they will have to adjust, and we may not demand too much of them, nor must we give the impression that the Balkan countries are to be added to them overnight; hence our constant reiteration that this is a long-term process.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to strongly encourage you to seize the initiative in relation to the Mediterranean region and the Barcelona process. I am horrified by the sight, repeated week after week, of boats sailing from Morocco in the hope of reaching the Spanish coast, capsizing under stormy conditions, and the people on them being killed. I regard this as unacceptable, and we have to give the countries where these people live a chance of development – not only in the context of immigration policy, but as part of helping the countries of the Mediterranean to help themselves. Governments themselves must also help, of course. Any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Convention, Mr Papandreou, as Foreign Minister, will of course be one of its members, and I am sure – and I hope – that we will, if he follows the examples set by others, see and hear much of him in Parliament. Speaking on behalf of the PPE half of our group, I can say that we want a European constitution. We want a European constitution, we want European democracy, we want Europe to have capacity to act, and we want it to be transparent. And such a Europe must rest on the foundations of the Community Europe. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are sure that you support that too. We want the Convention to complete its work by the end of June and to be followed by a brief Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Italian Presidency will find us gaining a constitution for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to the Lisbon process. There is much truth in what has been said about this, but, Mr President of the Commission, we agree that we will only get qualified scientists to stay in Europe if we actually manage to reform our tax systems in such a way that it is again worthwhile to make investments, in such a way that Europe is a place where achievement is worth the effort, if we are willing to reform our labour laws and make them more flexible, and if we are able to change our social security systems so that they are characterised by greater self-reliance, so that subsidiarity and solidarity are intertwined. Such a Europe must become more competitive, and so working in it must again be made worth the effort. We need to encourage people to take the initiative, and, above all else, we must not make the citizen promises that the European Union is unable to keep. So let your coordinating efforts be directed towards tax cuts for businesses, reform of the labour market, and reform of our social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two important foreign policy issues, Mr President-in-Office of the Council; Iraq is one of them. We must see that weapons of mass destruction are a menace and that, when they threaten us or regions of the globe, those who have them at their disposal, must relinquish them, but what we do and have to do, we do within the framework of the United Nations. We support your efforts towards a common European position on this issue, on the basis of action by the United Nations. It is not acceptable for a European government to say, ‘Leave us out; no matter what the United Nations decide, we're not taking part’, or for another government to give the impression of saying, ‘Whatever happens, we stand alongside the United States’. No, any European policy must be a responsible one, and I would encourage you, and us, to go about it as Europeans, and together.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned cooperation with Russia, and in May of this year you will be travelling to a meeting in St Petersburg. Appalling things are currently happening in Chechnya. The Russian Government's unwillingness to extend the OSCE mandate in Chechnya violates the humanitarian principles that we share. I urge you and beg you to raise these things not only when you are in St Petersburg, that beautiful city, which is Russia's window on the world, but make it clear to the Russian Government even before you get there that we expect the OSCE mandate to be extended, that we expect this Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Chechnya, which we have decided on, to actually be allowed to travel to that country. Mr President, I welcome the way you have often encouraged us by referring to our values, but we will gain credibility only if we lay hold of these values not merely for ourselves in this wonderful European Union, which, taking everything into account, is democratic and in a good position both economically and in terms of human rights, but also for the people on our doorstep and throughout the world. That is why we have to speak in a loud voice, and I would encourage you to do just that in St Petersburg.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this six-month period, the Council is going to deal with five historic challenges which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, enlargement. It is a fortunate coincidence that enlargement to ten is going to be signed in Athens, the cradle of democracy; and in a country such as Greece, which will hold the next Olympic games. Two inventions dating back 2 500 years which are foundation stones of the current Europe. And the Olympics were the first organised system of peace. All they need is access to the airport, but work is being done on that.</p>
<p class="contents">During this six months, we must finish the first phase of enlargement: the ten countries. And you have also mentioned some other important challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a reunified Cyprus. We entirely support any action you may take with a view to supporting the policy of Kofi Annan and we believe this is a very decisive step. Furthermore, and you have mentioned this, for the first time, you have in your hands –and I welcome Greece’s intelligent and courageous policy in relation to Turkey – the opportunity to play an historic role in terms of bringing us closer to Turkey. We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Lisbon Strategy. In this regard, we have seen that you insist on full employment, on technological development, on training and on social cohesion, which is an essential prerequisite for economic growth and not an obstacle. You have also held the Presidency of the monetary union since the middle of last year. In this regard, I would like to say that it is important that we increase our economic coordination. I am not going to ask you to employ such an interventionist and brutal policy as the United States, but it is important and necessary that Europe can be an economic driving force and end this stagnation. This is one of the Greek Presidency’s responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also address the President of the Commission. Mr Prodi, why do you not propose a world-wide Socrates in order to attract brains? This falls within the competence of the Commission and of course we in Parliament would support a proposal of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic chapter, the Greek Presidency has dedicated a section to maritime security, and following the drama we are witnessing of globalised shipwrecks, which are desolating our coasts – the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> being just one more, not the only one – I believe that the Greek Presidency must play an important role. You have more than half the Community’s gross tonnage and plenty of experience. You have spoken of sustainable development and the protection of the environment. All of this must be integrated into a European maritime area, which could be one of the Greek Presidency’s great pieces of work.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the policy on the third pillar, especially on immigration, the Greek Presidency is the first, since Tampere, to propose a proactive policy and not just a repressive one. In this regard, you can rely on Parliament in terms of the proposals you are going to make and I believe that, in this field, the Greek Presidency is showing the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future of Europe, the Convention has passed its half-way point – as President Giscard d’Estaing reminded us in an article which has appeared today in the press. Under the Greek Presidency, we want the Convention to prepare a draft Constitution. In this regard, both the work of our colleague, Mr Giorgos Katiforis, in completing the social dimension, and of Georgios Papandreu, as an addition to the Presidium of the Convention, are important. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must defend the Community method, which has allowed us to come this far, and which can inspire and organise our future.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also ask you to carefully study the timetable for the inauguration of the European Parliament, so that we can carry out our investiture of the Commission correctly and in a manner which is agreed amongst all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, with regard to external relations, I would like to say that a war with Iraq can be prevented, that the European Union must speak with one voice and that we await with interest the result of the meeting you are going to hold in Brussels with Hans Blix, the head of the inspectors. You have a very important job: to coordinate four members of the Security Council, plus one candidate, and everything possible must be done so that, within the multilateral and civilised framework of the UN, we can make progress and prevent a war which is not only unnecessary, but also extremely dangerous, and so that we can impose the principles of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr President-in-Office, and I will end here, please also continue an active policy in the Middle East. It is very important, everything is related, and you are our border with that region. It is essential that we are able to re-launch the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to offer you our support and I thank you for mentioning the Statute for Members of Parliament and parties, which is a sign of Greek capacity and wisdom. I wish you lots of luck.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have heard it said that there is nothing left for the Greek Presidency, other than providing the after-sales service for Copenhagen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greek Presidency will have a key role in the birth of a reformed and enlarged European Union. But to ensure a smooth birth a good midwife is essential and I am pleased to see that the Greek Presidency seems well prepared to play that role.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the Union, the Convention is due to report in Thessaloniki. As every good midwife knows, it is important to keep pushy relatives out of the delivery room and while the discussions in the Elysée Palace tonight will be important, they must not dictate the outcome of that Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to ensure that the baby is not strangled at birth by Member States fearful of an ambitious constitutional Treaty. I would therefore take issue with the President-in-Office and say we should not have a lengthy interim period. We need a short IGC, which should be a tidying-up exercise to ratify quickly the outcome of the Convention quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 will be the year when politicians must sell enlargement to the voters. Nine out of ten of the new countries will have referenda between March and September this year. We need to put far more effort into making the case for a 'yes' vote in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe than we have put recently into convincing citizens in our current Union that Europe is a 'good thing'. Liberal Democrats in this House and beyond are committed to campaigning in the new countries to make sure that we get a 'yes' vote and we call on others to join us.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope in particular that the Greek Presidency can use its privileged relationship with many on the island of Cyprus to ensure that a united island joins our Union. Time is short, but recent developments, both on the island and in Ankara, have created a window of opportunity and I hope that you, Mr President-in-Office, will work with all parties to craft a compromise. I welcome the generous aspirations that you have expressed today in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to succeed, however, for its current citizens and its new ones, it will need reform. As we approach the third anniversary of the ten-year Lisbon strategy, it has to be said that progress to date on productivity, growth, employment, investment, research and development has been disappointing. The continued economic slow-down is making structural reform more, not less, urgent and governments should not be deflected from the goals they set themselves. It will be important for the presidency to reaffirm commitment to a reformed Stability Pact, to focus on the underlying deficit, to give the Commission the power to issue early warnings to countries in danger. It will also need to stick to the timetable for the Financial Services Action Plan, which has already shown dangerous slippage, and to secure approval of the takeover bids directive.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want someone to help you along this path, why not give the European Parliament more of a role in the follow-up to the decisions of the Spring Councils, in holding the Council accountable for the decisions that are taken? That is something we would do very well.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this. The Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have created a Community of values. I welcome the emphasis in your presidency's statement on the values of a generous, outward-looking and civilised society. You speak in your document of a planned legal immigration policy. Exposed as you are on Europe's southern and eastern flanks, you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less. The fact is that, as long as we keep out their produce and deprive them of the hope of economic development, we will take the people of the developing countries to the south and the east. We need many of them to deal with the problems of an ageing population here, or the brain drain problems the Commission President referred to. Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well, but my time is running short. I would, however, say that the Greeks are well acquainted with what we in the rest of Europe understand by the word 'marathon'. You take the baton from the last runner, Denmark, and try and cover as much ground as possible as quickly as possible, before handing it over to the next presidency. We wish you good speed in the marathon that you are running on our behalf.</p>

The public do not want one, and this is where the EU – as many Members of this House have said, and this is something I want to endorse – must put all its political weight into the balance, and it must be united in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Statements, such as that made by the German ambassador to the UN, to the effect that no second resolution by the Security Council would be needed to give legitimacy to an attack on Iraq by the USA, are counter-productive. Fortunately, the Greek Presidency of the Council is taking the opposite line. You have our entire support in your efforts to prevent war, in the teeth of the Bush administration's declared intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">That employment, economic, and social policies rank high on the Greek agenda is another thing that earns our high regard, but, especially in view of the spring summit, what matters is what we do about them. The social pillar does indeed need to be strengthened to a perceptible degree, the EU must give its attention to the public's concerns and needs, and, above all else, press on with effective measures to counter mass unemployment and social exclusion within its borders. Most of all, the Member States must be willing to counteract the looming economic crisis in Europe. It is willingness to reform the Stability Pact that we regard as the litmus test in this regard. Be bold enough to do it! Let public investment at last be removed from the Stability Pact's calculation basis, preventing a socially irresponsible policy of cutting back until there is nothing left from making a difficult economic situation even worse, or even – as President Prodi has just warned us – leaving education utterly unable to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to endorse your objective of speeding up the Convention's reforming work. This is another area where the public interest demands that tangible progress be made, especially towards creating social Europe. My plea to you, and to your foreign minister as a new member of the Convention, is that you should insist on definite results in this issue in particular.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us begin with the Iraqi crisis. No, Mr Poettering, you are wrong when you say that we cannot do this or that. If we want a UN position, we must also say what must be decided at the Security Council; we cannot always hide behind the Security Council without specifying what it should decide.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, there is no proof of renewed aggression from the dictator Saddam Hussein. No proof at all. If the secret services have proof, they should announce it in all the newspapers. If they have proof of what Saddam Hussein possesses, he must also know. If that is the case, therefore, it is not a secret from anyone in Iraq, nor from Saddam Hussein. If he has weapons, he knows where he is hiding them, and if the CIA or the other secret services know where these weapons are hidden, we can tell the world, since, in any case, the enemy already knows. I do not, therefore, understand this strategy. That is why we are asking you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to be Socrates and Plato rolled into one, in other words, to bring together Mr Chirac, Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr Schröder, the heads of four governments represented at the United Nations Security Council, around a table to establish a European position that says ‘no’ to military intervention, which would not only be harmful to everyone, but which furthermore would not solve any problems. We must have the courage to say what we expect from the Security Council and I believe the European Union has a decisive role to play in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We said ‘yes’. One part of my group was in fact against this, but I have always said ‘yes’, to the need for military intervention in Afghanistan and Kosovo. Today, however, all those who said ‘yes’ to intervention in these two cases must say ‘no’ to pointless intervention. We must tell the Security Council this. France and the United Kingdom have a right of veto which would prevent this intervention. The European Union must have the strength to impose a ‘no’, at precisely the moment when North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, when it could make an atomic bomb, and yet we are, quite rightly, going to negotiate with it. Our current policy is one of encouraging the proliferation of nuclear weapons, by saying to dictators who already have nuclear weapons that we will not do anything to them, and saying to those who do not yet have such weapons that we will attack them. That amounts to telling dictators in every country to hurry up and get nuclear weapons, so that, that way, we will not do anything more to them and will negotiate with them. That is the Platonic logic currently being applied by Washington. I would ask Athens to say ‘no’ to this completely crazy thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the matter of the Spring Summit and sustainable development. I agree, but what are the relevant indicators with regard to the environment, the economy and social issues? These indicators must be equal. In Salonika, we therefore need to draw up a genuine list of indicators and a strategy to assess and put into perspective sustainable development. That would truly be an historic initiative, a first. There are numerous proposals here and there, but nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of maritime safety – fine! Where do the responsibilities lie, however, in environmental terms? Who will pay for the <span class="italic">Erika</span>? Who will pay for the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>? By way of an example: EUR 11 million were paid out by those responsible for the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. That is scandalous! It is scandalous because those responsible for maritime disasters should pay for everything. They must take on the entire risk and until they are forced to shoulder their responsibility, all the responsibility, they will do whatever they like. You know what I am talking about, since Greece is one of the countries that has the most responsibilities in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, you spoke of Cyprus. Naturally, you want a united Cyprus. In that case, however, both Turkey and Greece need to approach the problem of Greek and Turkish nationalism. One of the final barriers concerning the possibility of a united Cyprus is the fruit of these two nationalisms, I would even go so far as to say the joint action of Mr Denktash and Mr Clerides. The Cypriot people, the populations of the north and the south, do not want the same thing as their representatives. I therefore believe that together we must all have the strength and courage to provide a future for people who want this future.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, you would truly be Socrates and Plato combined if you succeeded in solving the problem of the status of Members of Parliament. If you achieve this, you may be my guest at the Parisian restaurant of your choice, as you will have become a grand master in politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty. UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction. No one can judge what will be in this report, but the military build-up of American and British troops in the Middle East is certainly an ominous sign that conflict in Iraq is a very real possibility. I welcome the recent comments of Prime Minister Simitis, when he stated that the United Nations is the forum that must be used to address the issues raised in the UN inspectors' report on Iraq. It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues. International global security is best dealt with multilaterally under the auspices of the UN, not unilaterally, and I welcome the objective for Prime Minister Simitis to secure a common European Union position on Iraq when the UN inspectors' report is published. This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process. We need to make European businesses more competitive; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises. The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority. When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union, a common approach is needed at EU level. Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration, asylum, refugees, displaced persons and European visas. As has been mentioned, the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union. Members of the Convention plan to have the draft new European Union Treaty ready for the Greek meeting in June in Thessaloniki and liaising with members of the Convention and preparing this new Treaty are certainly going to be very important for the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the decisions taken at the Copenhagen Summit last December, accession treaties for the new Member States joining the Union are to be signed on 16 April. These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states. It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union. The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish the Greek Presidency every success and would like to say, on behalf of my political group, that we will be more than willing to cooperate with them fully in the interests of the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Greece was the cradle of democracy. That means you have a special duty to give the EU a democratic overhaul.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our advice. Open up all meetings in which you debate laws. Make all the minutes from meetings available. Give the European Parliament and the national parliaments access to all papers from the Council’s working parties. Prepare complete registers of correspondence in the Council. Introduce public access to documents according to the principle of best practice among the countries. Place all agendas and minutes from the Council’s working parties on the Presidency’s web site. Give the Ombudsman a new statute, giving him or her access to everything for monitoring purposes. Give the Court of Auditors the access required for monitoring both the Commission and the organisations that use EU funds. Retain the rotating Presidency so that each country has six months in which to pull out all the stops. Keep the EU and the military separate and prepare reforms of agriculture, the structural funds and the budget so that we are ready to receive the new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, let Greek hospitality be accompanied by efficient organisation so that we can follow the work on your as yet unfinished web site and are able in six months to say what a jolly good Presidency Greece’s was. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek Presidency must therefore not simply be allowed to be the umpteenth routine presidency. After all, Greece is, more than any other country in Europe, best placed both from a political and historical point of view to use the presidency to readdress the issue of the absurdity of Turkey’s candidature. I will say it again now: Turkey is not a European country, it does not belong to our European community of peoples, either geographically or historically or as far as its socio-economic situation and culture are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we must maintain the very best relations with our Turkish neighbours, and that we can maintain the best possible trading and other relations where applicable. To give this country a prospect of acceding to the European Union is, however, complete madness. It will throw the door wide open to a massive tidal wave of immigration, and will in particular fundamentally change the nature of the European Union itself, a union that with the best will in the world will not be able to call itself European any more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency is being given an historic opportunity here. Take the initiative, for example, or suggest holding a referendum on Turkey’s candidature in all our European countries. Why should the electorates of democracies not have their say on something that is so crucial to our very existence? If you do not, my party in Flanders will turn the European elections in 2004 into a referendum on Turkey’s accession. It is striking that the German Christian-Democrats are also more or less announcing the same thing. If the Greek Presidency fails to take this opportunity – which will probably be the case – you will be taking on a very great responsibility, and the Turkish question may become a divisive element that could bring the house of Europe crashing down around our ears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to talk specifically about jobs, competitiveness and the internal market. I have a particular interest in that as the Parliament's rapporteur for the internal market strategy: if all goes well my report will be voted on in February and will be presented to you as a basis for action in the Economic Summit. Both of the Presidents have a crucial responsibility to the global economy over the next six months. Colleagues around the chamber have been quoted, and indeed Mr Simitis was quoted in the Financial Times yesterday, as saying that ‘we are in a global recession’. I hope he was wrongly quoted, because as far as I know, we are not. Growth is slowing down, but stimulating and restoring that growth will be crucial to the responsibilities of both Presidents over the next six months with that Economic Summit at the centrepiece.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that neither of your statements, Presidents, mentioned the fact that the foundation of economic growth in the European Union has to be the completion of the internal market, in spite of the fact that this is the tenth anniversary. We have had major reports from the Commission showing the benefits of the internal market and we also know that the principal engine for job creation in markets of the future is going to be jobs in the service economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest project that is coming forward to all of you is the completion of the internal market for services, and the barriers to companies setting up across the European Union are amply demonstrated by the work the Commission has done.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask you, President of the Council, to put on your agenda a determined effort by all Member State governments to clear out the difficulties of establishing businesses across the European Union. You do not need to wait for the Commission to take that initiative to create jobs and move the European economy forward, we look to you to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, actually since the autumn, it has been mainly the issues of enlargement and the Convention that have been the focus of attention at EU level. In its presentation Greece mentioned some well-chosen issues it intends to address over the next six months. Unfortunately, however, we cannot cure all the ills of the world even though we might want to.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be as good as our word with regard to improving European competitiveness, something that was endorsed at Lisbon. Things have, however, gone the opposite way. The United States of America has rushed off even further into the distance. There is barely any eye contact anymore. If there is, the Americans come whistling past one lap of the circuit ahead of us whatever the event, to use a sports image.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this I would ask Greece what it really intends to do during its presidency to put its own house in order also, to fulfil the Lisbon objectives? Does it intend to make the economic reforms insisted on by the Commission, and which Mr Prodi also mentioned here at the start, and, if so, working to what sort of timetable? If Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Germany keep to their commitments we can really talk about a Lisbon strategy and improvements in our competitiveness, but if that should not be the case, we might as well wipe our backsides with the Lisbon Declaration and say goodbye to European competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These steps must be based on a new UN resolution and must concentrate on eliminating any problems encountered. That is the view in the European countries where the vast majority of our people, as Mr Prodi said, is against a war in Iraq, and rightly so. Our people correctly fear that there are divisions in the international coalition against terrorism, that peace negotiations will be disrupted, that the sorely needed democratisation of the Middle East will be wrecked, followed by substantial repercussions for our economies, not least in the poorest countries that do not have their own crude oil.</p>
<p class="contents">At this historic moment our Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking the Greek Presidency to clearly state that this is also the position of the European Union. We are now asking for leadership from Europe, so that Europe speaks with one voice. We must do our utmost to prevent war in Iraq and at the same time engage in serious peace negotiations in the Middle East. The two-state solution must really be carried through now. Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We pride ourselves on our capacity for conflict prevention and humanitarian aid, and rightly so. We operate with a broad security concept, and rightly so, and realise that prevention is much better. Time after time, Europe has emphasised the importance of the multilateral approach via the Security Council. Confronted with incessant statements about a war that is all but unavoidable, it is of great importance that the Council and the Commission side with Parliament. Maximum pressure should, of course, be brought to bear on Saddam via the Security Council, but we must also make every effort to prevent war.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on President Bush to take the desire of our peoples for peace seriously and not to sow dissent in the international coalition against terrorism, and therefore to fight together for a peaceful and a more stable world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor, would I say, is it divided in the United States where, as we know, two-thirds of the people oppose this war.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a war which is both pointless and destructive, as members from all sides of this House have pointed out. However, the main brunt of any military attack will be borne by the Iraqi people themselves, who have been suffering under the economic embargo for years now. A military conflict will completely wipe out any hope of combating poverty, hunger, child malnutrition and the lack of medical care; these are the problems which the millions of people who are victims of an autocratic regime and a harsh western policy have to live with. The twelve-year embargo has itself operated as a weapon of mass destruction; it has cost the lives of one million people, half of whom were children. Anyone in any doubt need only visit the hospitals in Iraq, where children are dying of malnutrition and a lack of rudimentary medical care. I have seen them with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have a saying in Greece; you see who the good captains are in a storm and the European Union is fortunate to have at its helm a very able captain and an equally efficient crew, who have clearly demonstrated their courage, combined with caution, efficient management of national and European affairs and an inspired foreign policy which has made Greece a pole of stability in the problematic Balkan area, a pole that promotes dialogue and the resolution of differences by peaceful means.</p>

We all know that Greece is a relatively small country. No one expects any miracles. But they do expect the right approach. This is not the first Greek Presidency; there have been two previous presidencies, both of which left themselves open to a great deal of criticism. However, the previous presidencies held by the same party, PASOK, when Andreas Papandreou was prime minister, did leave us one useful legacy: a fighting stance, which often went against the grain, on the question of peace. I trust that this positive trend, which is demonstrated both by our country as a whole and its ruling party, will continue today, especially on the question of Iraq. As the chairman of the Greens quite rightly said, you cannot hide behind the Security Council. With four members in the Security Council, the European Union should be fighting to block a war.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very closely to the prime minister’s speech and I should like to comment on three points which worry me. First, the fact that the prime minister said that this is a joint annual programme of the Greek and Italian presidencies. In my opinion, Mr Simitis is – and needs to be – one thing, and Mr Berlusconi is another, and I fail to see how they will find any common ground on social issues, on democratic issues, on the issue of relations with the USA or on media issues. A second point which worries me is that agricultural policy – and I am thinking here of small family-run holdings, especially in the south, being squeezed by reforms and by what is happening in the World Trade Organisation – warranted no more than one line at the end of the prime minister’s speech. I expect him to refer to this at greater length in his next speech. And the third point has to do with social issues. Mr Prime Minister, I am waiting for Greece to apply Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term work. It should have started applying this directive on 10 July 2002 but has yet to do so. Please do not put Mrs Diamantopoulou in the unenviable position of having to institute proceedings against Greece before the European Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you have not really developed your project on maritime safety. I hope that we will not have any unpleasant surprises, since, as you know, European citizens in both Galicia and France are impatiently, not to say desperately, waiting for Europe to come to their aid, to establish strict rules, clear rules, to ensure safe maritime transport and to prevent pollution. We know, of course, how worried Greece is about this area; we therefore wonder, for example, if it would support the creation of a unit of European coastguards, a ‘Green Berets’ force to organise the volunteers, which was so sorely lacking in Galicia. Would it impose the designation of ports of refuge? I shall stop the list there, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The second subject that concerns me is the Spring Summit. There again, it is with regret that I would like to say – and I am also addressing the President of the Commission – that you are missing the point, because the Spring Summit had a specific aim, to measure progress made or ground lost in the field of sustainable development through the policies of the Union. The summit you are preparing for is nothing unusual, and yet there is urgency. I shall only give one example: will the Union continue to provide financial aid to multinational companies with nothing in return, without ensuring sustainable employment for employees? I am of course thinking of the Daewoo workers in Lorraine, France, who are once again out of a job while the Union and the region of Lorraine had banked on this restructuring, granting considerable financial aid. This is the opposite of sustainable development. What I would therefore like your spring reports to do is present genuine policies which take account of the environment in order to avoid destroying it and which also create truly sustainable jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You observed that the agreement between NATO and the European Union has now come into being, thus leaving the way open for the next European defence policy measures, which we can expect to be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is an eventuality to which particular attention must be drawn, as the European Union will then, for the first time, be taking on responsibilities in defence in a visible way.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future. Do you share the view that the constitutional treaty currently under negotiation should include an article stipulating a mutual defence commitment, comparable to the corresponding article in the treaty on the Western European Union? That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you also, very briefly, addressed the area of armaments policy, alluding to the way in which the countries of the European Union spend EUR 150 billion on defence, whereas we are always being told that the excessive duplication resulting from this means that efficiency is minimal. Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created? What definite steps will the Greeks take during their presidency of the Council?</p>

There appears to be broad agreement in this House that Resolution 1441 does not automatically result in military action, but rather that, in the light of the weapons inspectors' reports, any further action must be subject to a resolution by the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the presidency should also say this on behalf of the EU, and so I ask you to take the initiative by stating this here and now. That you should do so is made all the more important by the powerful impression that the United States of America takes a different view, and we do indeed need to state what our differences with them are. They do indeed believe – and how else is the deployment of 100 000 troops in the region to be explained? – that Resolution 1441 does not exclude the possibility of immediate military strike action, but there is also the implicit danger that international law, to which nations are subject, and by which alone world peace can be guaranteed on a long-term basis, will be jeopardised by unilateral power-seeking on the part of one UN member state. This is where the European Union has to state its position in clear terms, the primary reason for this being that international law cannot be enforced in an arbitrary and opportunistic way.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of North Korea, against which there is a mass of evidence that it is desirous or capable of producing weapons of mass destruction – and its actions suggest that this is the case – negotiations are in progress, and yet it is Saddam Hussein who is threatened, despite the presence of a host of inspectors in his country, who have found nothing. I might add that this threat is not justified under the UN Charter. Bringing this difference between us into the open is one of the primary tasks of the European Union and of its Greek Presidency, and I know that you are determined to do this. You can count on the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House!</p>

I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which, with falling incomes, is now under serious threat. In the context of the mid-term review proposals due to be adopted this week and the forthcoming world trade talks, I appeal to the Greek Presidency to work towards continued commitment at EU level for the European agricultural model and to guarantee a decent livelihood for our farmers. The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we address the very serious problem of the declining age profile in European agriculture, in the not too distant future Parliament will be sitting in an emergency session to address what has turned out to be a very serious problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The five priorities that you have enumerated and set yourself are, politically speaking, not merely a matter of logic but also of necessity. The list does not sound particularly sensational, but, as you will already have gathered from the speeches here in the European Parliament, a number of these topics carry within themselves the seeds of potential tensions, both within the European Union and beyond its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The smouldering Iraq crisis, along with America's continuing deployment of troops in this region and the divergent views on this emanating from London, Berlin and Paris, demand sensitive handling. What I would ask the Greek Presidency in this regard is what measures they contemplate taking in order to perhaps get the EU to have a single line on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question has to do with enlargement, and, in particular, with your strategy in relation to Turkey. In Copenhagen, Turkey was given a specific date, and the prospect of the commencement of accession negotiations, subject to its fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria by that deadline. This is a considerable obstacle to surmount, and it is at present far from clear that Turkey will be able to meet these conditions. Quite apart from that, I believe that it is wrong to be always offering Turkey only an either/or choice and not the option of a privileged special relationship, a perhaps far more rewarding prospect, and one that has already been addressed in a report by Mr Brok. The question I have in this context relates to Greek strategy towards Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third point, and this is something to which I would like to give favourable mention. Your declaration of belief, in the chapter on energy policy, in the establishment of common rules on nuclear safety is something that I very much welcome. Do you think this has a real chance of being more widely accepted in the Council? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would nonetheless like to touch upon a topic that is not a live issue – at any rate, not at the moment – by which I mean the situation in the Balkans. You have announced a sort of Integration Summit in Saloniki, with the intention of opening up for the Balkan countries the road that leads to the European Union, and I regard that as highly meritorious, although we must not be deluded. Even today, there are manifestations of crisis, and there has been a recent recurrence of gunfights in Sandzak. We know that neither the situation in Yugoslavia – now Serbia and Montenegro – nor that in Kosovo have really been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to see it as important that the Greek Presidency, and of course the EU as a whole, should send out signals to the Balkan countries to the effect that a way is open for them to join the European Union, a difficult and lengthy way though it may be. We must be guided by the need for adaptation of the mechanisms for encouragement and support. There is a great difference between what we are currently giving to these poorest of poor countries and what we gave to the countries that are about to join us, so these instruments need to be adapted. The next, post-2004, Commission will have to give consideration to how to allocate responsibilities for the Balkans within itself. If, though, unmistakeable signals go out from Saloniki, even the Commission will be able to adapt itself as necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for annual progress reports. These countries need to know when they are moving closer to the European Union, when stagnation is setting in, and when, indeed, their progress is being set back. All the forces in these regions need to know that the chance of moving closer to the European Union is there, but that we will monitor, very closely and country by country, whether real use has been made of these opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Council, I believe that, one day in the distant future, Saloniki may well mean for this region what Copenhagen – by which I mean the 1993 Copenhagen Council – meant for the present candidate countries. Let the signal you send out be a bold one, one that is readily understood, and one that also awakens a sense of responsibility in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly support what the chairman of my group has said.</p>
<p class="contents">Before coming here, I asked the Greek Presidency if it would give priority to the issue of international maritime traffic in dangerous goods. I subsequently noted that the President-in-Office of the Council did in fact refer to this question. Maritime traffic is an important issue for Greece and it is to be expected that the Greek Prime Minister should give it priority. However, Mr President-in-Office, international maritime traffic has at present unfortunately fallen from grace and is associated with the situation in Galicia, the location of one of Europe's and the world's biggest disasters over the last 30 years. These names are all too familiar: ‘Andos Patria’, ‘Telepolicomander’, ‘Orquiola’, ‘Cason’ and ‘Prestige’. Mr President-in-Office, like those I have quoted many of the names are Greek and most of the shipowners were or are Greek. There seems to be no solution and no end to the ‘Prestige’ disaster: our coastline and sea have been contaminated and the wreck of the ‘Prestige’ on the seabed still represents a continuing threat. The actions of the Spanish Government, of Mr Aznar's <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span>, have been disastrous, and the same applies to the Galician Government, while the European Union has stood on the sidelines, judging at the Copenhagen Council that five million euros would be enough to solve this problem – which is a problem for Europe as well as for Galicia and for other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The sea is now ruled by illegal and lawless mafias. Yet faced with this problem, the public, volunteers, seamen and fishermen have had to do the job of the government and of the European Union and solve this problem with their own hands, because the ‘black tide’ is still landing on the shores of Galicia, of the Iberian Peninsula and even of France.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen European Council laid bare a serious political conflict: the Member States turned their back on the public, on the fishermen and on the volunteers who had acted so admirably. The Member States have neither implemented the ‘Erika’ legislation nor set up the compensation fund. This is very far removed from the attitude of the United States, where with the Oil Pollution Act they are preventing accidents and even setting up a responsibility fund of four billion euros. What does the Greek Presidency intend to do along these lines? I believe it should distinguish itself by taking action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He rightly stated that one of the basic objectives of the presidency is to promote the Lisbon strategy; Mr Prodi also had a great deal to say about this and very important it was too. However, I read in the international press today that the Commission is about to submit a report which concludes that Europe is losing its battle to acquire a more competitive economy in the world by 2010. On the contrary, growth is very weak and the political will is lacking. This Commission report also states, if the Figaro is to be believed, that it expects a twin-track Europe to emerge, with Sweden and Denmark fast-forwarding on one track and Greece, Italy and France in slow motion on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to ask is: first, is there a common policy for promoting the Lisbon strategy or is it a question of each country either doing what it likes or, at the very least, failing to apply any such common policy? And secondly: do you intend to apply policies that will help achieve the Lisbon objectives in all the Member States of the European Union, especially Greece? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a crucial time because the only superpower, the United States, is doing all it can to turn its tremendous power into a global hegemony and, naturally, this is provoking a reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">When we emerge from these vicissitudes, the entire world – and the European Union in particular – will be a different place, regardless of the outcome of the crisis. What is certain is that the post-war world order and its institutions will be the victims of the conflict and a different world will emerge from it. The European Union needs to have a view and an opinion about this new world. However, I get the impression that the prevailing mood in the institutions of the European Union is one of complacency, as if what is happening has nothing to do with us. I get the impression that many of us believe that we are living in a vacuum, in another world, immune from what is already happening and what is yet to come.</p>
<p class="contents">In times such as these, a European Union presidency has to be able to rework the values which we say we stand for into a vision of the world to come, and to persuade the people of Europe that these values are worth fighting for. Only with this priority will a presidency be successful and worthy of the times we live in.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish there were six instead of five, but I think that the sixth will be added in due course. I refer to the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. The final proposals are due before the end of January. The European Union is already taking on ten new members. The rural population of the European Union will rise by 165% and rural land by 43%. Cultivable land will increase by 55%. And yet the budget up to 2013, in the best case scenario – with minimum inflation – will remain the same. I should like to ask you what your presidency’s objectives are, Mr Prime Minister, and what you intend to do for the millions of European farmers, in both the current European Union and the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Lisbon is concerned, two of the ten years have passed and little has been achieved, far less than the 20% which should have been achieved by now. What is certain is that, instead of closing, the competitiveness differential between our economy and the American economy, which is our main competitor, is now even wider. I was both interested and delighted to see that entrepreneurship and small enterprises are one of your priorities. An excellent move. Today you announced this in an ambitious voice. We shall be here in about five months’ time, totting up the accounts to see what has been done. I should like to know, Mr Prime Minister and President-in-Office, what you intend to do to achieve these ambitious objectives, which you have failed to achieve at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trakatellis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, while welcoming the fact that Greece has taken over the presidency, I should like to point out that it has done so at an historic moment in the development of the unique phenomenon which we refer to as European integration and which, among other things, has replaced the post-war division of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the priorities of the Greek Presidency, as time is so short, I shall confine myself to the following brief points and comments:</p>
<p class="contents">On enlargement: the main decisions may have been taken during the previous presidency, but the final stages have yet to be completed, culminating in the signature of the accession treaties in Athens. Preparations still have to be made so that the new Member States can adjust smoothly to European developments, which is why enlargement has rightly been given priority and will require close attention if we are to avoid irregularities and delays in the accession process. I noted that you intend to continue the enhanced pre-accession strategy with Bulgaria and Romania, Mr President-in-Office, and rightly so. But we must not forget the southern Balkans, where <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>with the European Union started up some time ago under the stability and association process. This <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>needs to be encouraged here too, so that we can consolidate our relations, which we are not doing when it comes to the security and stability of the new, enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Lisbon strategy, I should like to focus on sustainable development. The need to promote a sustainable development strategy within the framework of European integration is even more urgent today, what with the pressure of enlargement and increasing globalisation. The plan for implementing the sustainable development strategy drawn up by the European Commission is already filling the vacuum between what we say and what we do, by way of legislation, to protect the environment and public health and encourage the application and mainstreaming of the environmental dimension in all our policies. That is why I think it is so important for us to adopt a step-by-step procedure for monitoring policy in practice at the spring European Council. The difficulties in getting the Kyoto protocol signed make it even more imperative that we step up dialogue and collaboration with the USA, Japan and developing countries. Obviously, the European Union cannot deal with this as an internal problem. So it needs to shoulder its responsibilities at international level, which means pioneering efforts to achieve sustainable development through technology and science. This is where I should like to focus your attention, Mr President-in-Office, because Europe has clearly started slipping behind recently, especially in biotechnology, in comparison with the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as defence and immigration policy are concerned, I agree. As you know, we have been calling for an immigration policy in the European Union for years, without any concrete results. We expect an integrated policy to be developed and an integrated policy on illegal immigration to be developed. Although illegal immigrants themselves are often living in abject circumstances, they also cause huge problems in the societies and to the people living in the Member States of the European Union. Measures therefore need to be taken to improve the management of our external borders and to combat illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings by promoting measures under the third pillar. I was most interested to hear you talk of readmission agreements with all our partners, especially those under serious pressure, and would ask you, please, to push ahead on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Thessaloniki Council needs to push on with the reform of the Treaties of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in foreign relations, I think that you need to encourage Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, basically under a long-term Euro-Mediterranean policy. Italy is to follow Greece, giving two countries with excellent knowledge of these problems the chance to draw up an efficient Euro-Mediterranean policy. Cooperation is not enough. We need a long-term policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you every success. I trust that in six months’ time we shall meet here, with you reporting that you have done what you said here today, and with us ready to exercise constructive, honest criticism in good faith. May I wish you every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are on the brink of the biggest enlargement in the history of the Union, an enlargement which puts an end to a division which has lasted fifty years. We are about to draft a European constitution and strengthen our institutions, in order to guarantee the continuing cohesion of Europe, even after the ten new countries have joined, and ensure that it continues to operate as a political union so that it can achieve its objective, which is greater and greater unification of the nations of Europe. The Convention has called for more Europe on numerous occasions and the Greek Presidency will put the finishing touches to this structure in Thessaloniki in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is also in the middle of a very serious downturn in the economy. The global economy is in recession, but that is nothing new. The economic depression in Europe has lasted at least ten years. Europe has resisted an inspired strategy, the Lisbon strategy. And now this strategy is also in danger of being washed away by the recession. I think that Greece, a country whose economy has recovered thanks to a programme of reform carried out on its own initiative, and a country which has achieved rates of growth putting it at the forefront of the European Union and has used this process to bring about a positive revolution in the agricultural sector, and a country which now has a first-world rather than a third-world economy, thanks also, of course, to the common agricultural policy, is now well prepared to breathe new life into the Lisbon process, which it badly needs if it is to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Greece, as a country on the borders of Europe, has always linked trade between east and west and it can do the same now; it understands better than anyone else that the economies of eastern Europe have the potential to become a driving force behind the economy of the Fifteen. These creative prospects cannot be reversed. We are not going to cancel enlargement and we are not going to stop drafting a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Their beneficial results, however, may be delayed if we have to deal with war with Iraq. I agree with my honourable friend Mr Poettering that nuclear weapons cannot be left in irresponsible hands. But nor can they be left in responsible hands, Mr Poettering. There are no hands responsible enough for these terrifying, apocalyptic weapons we have armed ourselves with. We do not know what is going to happen in Iraq. But we do know that the President-in-Office of the Council is the only European leader who has had the unfortunate privilege of dealing with the danger of his country’s becoming involved in a catastrophic war. He managed to avert that war. I trust the experience he gained will help him do as much for the war which is threatening the entire planet as we speak. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Until recently relations between Parliament and the Council were not extensive, but a combination of an increase in the powers of this House and the prospect of an increase in the number of Member States has had the effect of bringing our two institutions much closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Liberal Group I welcome this closer working relationship between Parliament and the Council. We see it very publicly, particularly in the Convention, and also in the number of very successful negotiations through the codecision process. I welcome the approach taken, first by the Danish Presidency and now continued by the Greek Presidency, to much closer working relations with this House, shown in the President-in-Office's concern that a statute for Members should form part of the successful reform of the European Union institutions. We look forward to working closely with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek Government has indeed taken over the presidency at a time of acute economic crisis, with growing prospects of a new, even more murderous attack by the imperialist powers on the Iraqi people. Their pretext is that Iraq has a smoking gun, although they have yet to find it; and yet these self-same hypocrites make, use and sell every type of weapon of mass destruction there is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government was party to the wars against Yugoslavia and Afghanistan and has said that it will join the impending war against Iraq, even if it is hiding behind its fig leaf by saying that war needs to be preceded by a UN Security Council resolution. The Greek Presidency will promote the interventionist European defence and security policy by immediately deploying the European army, first in Bosnia and the FYROM and then anywhere else it is needed. It will step up the attack on employment, insurance and pension rights. It will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms during the mid-term review of the CAP. It will promote mechanisms for deporting immigrants and strict asylum laws. Using terrorism as a pretext, it will promote the transposition of anti-grass roots European legislation into national law and the abolition of democratic rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The signature of the Treaty enlarging the European Union under the Greek Presidency will mark the start of even more hardships for its people and will, we fear, result in the Euro-partition of Cyprus. May I reassure anyone who may be worried by the socialist label sported by the Greek Government that, as we have heard today, the Greek Presidency intends to keep big business happy. That is why the people of Europe who, unlike big business, have nothing good to expect from the Greek Presidency, should not be complacent. The only way out is for them to join forces and step up their fight against this policy. In Greece, demonstrations are almost a daily occurrence. They will culminate with demonstrations in June, which we invite the workers of Europe to attend. As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned, it will be right on the front line of this fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, on the research and development policy of the European Union, Mr Prodi talked about the need to develop and invest in clean technologies. Obviously our group agrees with this. We need to develop environmentally friendly technologies, partly because of the employment opportunities they create and the training needs that exist, but also because of their positive social repercussions. I note that the Greek Presidency has identified cutting-edge technologies, in biotechnology and defence, as research priorities. That begs a few questions about how we are deciding what we wish to invest in, with whom we are wishing to compete, and for what purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am interested in understanding how this links to the current treaty requirement in Article 6 to integrate the environment into policies and practices of the European Union. Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this. We are pleased that in future we are going to be monitoring policies in terms of a social sustainable development emphasis. Given that the Spring summit is supposed to be about sustainability, I am also interested to know what proposals there will be from Council about how it is going to change its own structures to deal with this much more integrated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is also interested to note that the Greek Presidency's priorities include the tasks relating to services of general interest, because we are going to be looking at the preparations for Cancun and the offers from the EU in that connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a certain extent we can understand the position of the Greek Government, since it aims to solve its problem from the top, by transferring it to the European Union. At Union level, however, as I have already said several times to my fellow Members here in Parliament, we should not accept what strongly resembles a decision to forge ahead without having considered it further.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece’s position with regard to the institutions surprised us a little. The Prime Minister, Costas Simitis, who is here today, said recently, speaking in a French daily newspaper, that ‘Greece believes we need a strong Commission rather than two decision-making bodies, the Commission and the Council, otherwise the European Union could risk turning into an intergovernmental Union and not the federal model we are hoping for’. On studying this statement carefully, we learn that, according to the Greek Government, the Commission should possess greater decision-making power than even the Council. That is indeed far removed from an intergovernmental Union, but it is also far removed from the traditional Community model. I hope that the Prime Minister will contradict me later on.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the priorities of the Greek Presidency, we welcome the emphasis placed on the issues of immigration, asylum and external border management, which today have in fact become extremely serious. We would therefore ask the Presidency to show greater firmness in these matters, and in particular in the fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are surprised at the absence, in these priorities, of a specific chapter on economic and monetary union, because, on this point, Greece could have presented not only priorities for the future, but also a summary of the past. This summary would have been fully justified, since Greece has presided over the Eurogroup for the past six months. We cannot, however, see anything: there is no such summary! With regard to the past, how has the euro favoured growth, or, on the contrary, has it had an adverse effect? With regard to the future, how, for example, does the Greek Presidency intend to contribute to making the Stability Pact more intelligent? We would have benefited from some clarification on all of these points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> I should like to comment on a methodological question.</p>
<p class="contents">I said at the beginning that, following the decisions taken at the summit, the two countries assuming the presidency in any one year must agree on the issues they intend to deal with during the year. And that is what we have done with Italy. We did not agree on individual policies, nor do we agree with the views propounded by each country. Each country has its own views. But the programme of issues we have to deal with is an agreed programme; one example is how the future of Europe should be handled. We agreed that the Convention on the future of Europe should submit its conclusions by June, so that the Intergovernmental Conference can be held in the second half of the year. Our aim under this agreement – as the last summit in fact decided – was that the Convention should finish by June and the Intergovernmental Conference should start in the second half of the year. That is what we mean by cooperation between the two countries which hold the presidency during the course of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Convention is concerned, I agree with the members who said that the outcome should be a draft constitution or constitutional treaty, and that is what we too are aiming for. However, I should like to ask all of you to keep up the pressure so that we keep to the timetable. By which I mean, we want the Convention to finish before the summit in June, so that the June summit can decide how to proceed in the next six months, because I too believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should be wrapped up by the end of the year, so that the constitutional area is clarified before May 2004 when the new members start exercising all their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of Iraq. I have listened to the honourable Members and I would like to make clear that the presidency is interested primarily – quite apart from the peace I referred to – in all the members of the European Union taking a common stand. That is why I have already been in touch with my counterparts; that is why my foreign minister, Mr Papandreou, has been in touch with his counterparts; that is why we agreed that the General Affairs Council on 27 January would discuss precisely how we can take a common line in general and at the United Nations in particular. We are not alone in taking this initiative; the other Member States are also on board. We are not hiding behind the United Nations. I do not accept that. But it would be a mistake to believe that, because we have 4 members, it is we who decide what will be done at the United Nations, as if no discussion with the other countries were needed. It is not just the United States; Russia and China mainly and other countries also play a part. We need a common stand in the world and we hope that the common stand that prevails will be disarmament in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and peace. War is not necessary. We need to try and achieve results without military intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the question of enlargement. The first issue is Cyprus. I agree that the Annan plan offers a window of opportunity and there is a momentum at the moment which bodes well for a solution. I also agree that we need to get past ethnicities and that stupid, exaggerated ethnicities exist and that stands continue to be taken that reflect attitudes which prevailed during or at the beginning of the last century. However, I do not believe that Mr Clerides stands for this sort of ethnicity. On the contrary, Mr Clerides is one of those who has fought consistently for a solution which brooks no ethnicity. And as far as Mr Denktash is concerned, I should point out that, so far, he has not given a single convincing sign that he accepts the Annan plan. He needs to give convincing signs of acceptance, rather than of appearing to want negotiations to drag on endlessly until the United Nations plan is abandoned. The upside of all this is that the Turkish-Cypriot people are really pushing for peace and an end to the problem. That bodes well not just for a solution to the problem; it bodes well, more to the point, for a workable, effective solution that consolidates the will of both communities to bring about a modus vivendi and real union.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question raised about Turkey, I speak here as the presidency. The European Union decided to grant Turkey candidate status in Helsinki. That is what the European Union decided. And every presidency has to work on the basis of that decision. Greece also believes this was the right decision. Turkey has been present in Europe for centuries and, if Europe wants to wield any influence in the wider world beyond its borders, in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia for example, it is in our interests to have Turkey on board. Besides, anyone who has lived in Turkey knows only too well that a large part of the Turkish population subscribes to our values and has the same views as us about society and mankind. Of course, there are others who take a different view, but European ideas and European values are not foreign to Turkey. By no means. I think that we need to continue in this vein, as decided at Helsinki. I agree with the honourable Members who said that the Balkans still have some way to go but that we cannot ignore the fact that they too are part of Europe and that, at a later date, and it is still some way off, a future European Union will need to unite the whole of Europe. We do not want any outcasts and I must emphasise, because I have visited these countries on many occasions, that the possibility of their joining the European Union at some point in the future is giving them an incentive to improve their democracy and their economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous members raised the question of safety at sea; first, I disagree with one member who said that these accidents were caused by ships sailing under the Greek flag. No accidents have been caused by ships sailing under the Greek flag. These ships were sailing under other flags. The Greek Government is required to inspect ships sailing under the Greek flag and these inspections are so thorough that ships in the European Union sailing under the Greek flag are classified as ships requiring no further inspection. As far as the <span class="italic">Ρrestige</span> is concerned, someone said that perhaps Greece is not interested in regulations. On the contrary, we agreed with all the proposals made at the last council held on the subject; we ourselves tabled the same proposals for dealing with these problems, by cutting transitional periods and so on, and we are now waiting for the Commission to submit the relevant conclusions to the Council. The Greek Presidency intends to ensure that these proposals go straight to the top of the Council’s agenda and are adopted as quickly as possible, because we too want clean seas. I can assure you that, in Greece, both non-governmental organisations and the state are working for clean seas with the means currently available.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said about the Lisbon policy and what does or does not need to be done. First, we agree with the Commission’s spring report. The spring report stressed that growth rates need to be stepped up by adopting all the policies decided. I should like to reply to all the comments made by reading out quickly not all – there is too little time for that – but some of the issues we shall be working on: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> plus issues under the new employment policy. I believe that if we make headway on some of these, then we shall have done some good.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, agricultural policy in relation to these economic issues. I must emphasise that we are interested in pushing ahead with the mid-term review of agricultural policy. However, there are two strategic views on agricultural policy in the European Union. Who or what do we want to help? Production or the producers? And when anyone says we want to help producers, they mean small and medium-sized producers. As a country, we take the view that we need to help small and medium-sized producers, who are in the vast majority in Europe, and that we should not be helping large producers. This is where there is a clash of interests and we need to realise that. Agricultural policy serves varying purposes, depending on the regulations. We can improve agricultural policy and I think that farming and the countryside will benefit if we focus on small and medium-sized producers. But all this needs to be discussed with the Council. That is our view. The Union’s view will depend on the outcome of the Council’s discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish, ladies and gentlemen, by commenting on the question of what is to be done about defence policy issues and whether we are to push ahead with standard types of armaments. I mentioned that the Greek Presidency intends to put the question of coordinated efforts in technology and research to the spring council. Precisely so that we end up with standard types of armaments. We do not want Europe manufacturing all sorts of arms; we just want certain types for all the Member States and we think that this is a useful exercise, even though we believe that, at some point, we should stop arming. However, we feel that this approach will serve research and technology as things now stand.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, the presidency is never an easy task. We are aware of that, but we hope to take a giant stride forward, within the framework we have outlined, which the next presidency can build on. We shall be pleased if, at the end of our six months in office, Europe is stronger, Europe has a clearer voice and Europe is more competitive and feels more secure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first question concerns the proposal to create a worldwide Socrates programme. I believe that this is the way to go. We have already created an Erasmus World based on the same criteria, save that the financing is such as to restrict us to minor projects. Let this be clear: if Europe does not undertake a major common research programme to bring back the drained brains from abroad, to make the most of our young people, to create a breeding ground for scientific and cultural knowledge, then we are lost. You all know that I never exaggerate. I can assure you: we are lost. We, with our costs, with our social structure, with our diversities – if we do not take a great leap forward we will be lost. I will give you just one example, by way of a practical illustration. At present, it costs three times as much to transport a container from China to Amsterdam as it does to transport a container from Amsterdam to China. Such are the market forces on both sides. I can give you another figure. In the past month, there have been 8 million new subscribers to mobile telephone networks in China – in one month. Do we really think we can tackle this world with our research sector in such a fragmented state, without entering the technology race, without being at the forefront of innovation? We are deluding ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My response to the second question is this. We have been accused of not mentioning the benefits of the internal markets. No: these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year. I would merely point out that so great is the importance of the internal market that, if we were to analyse the sectors which have been affected by inflation in recent months, entering the great, heated debate on the euro, we would find that, where the internal market has been implemented, there has not been any inflation and where there have been delays in implementing the internal market there has been inflation. Suffice it to say that our future depends on the competition the internal market can bring.</p>
