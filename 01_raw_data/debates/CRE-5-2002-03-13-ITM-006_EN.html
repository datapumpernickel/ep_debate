Yesterday, when we debated this issue, I asked the President whether we might hold the debate in another way and perhaps obtain a more lively debate by my talking for four minutes and subsequently rounding off the debate with a further minute of my speaking time. The President was very obliging and said that we were perfectly entitled to do that, and the whole matter passed off splendidly.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to you, Mr President, is as to whether you will instruct the Sittings Directorate that this is in actual fact a procedure that can be used here in Parliament and that it is supported by the College of Presidents with a view to bringing about a more lively debate. When I asked the Sittings Directorate whether this could be done, they in fact said that the debate could not be conducted in this way. I would therefore ask you to instruct the Sittings Directorate that this is a method of proceeding that we use here in Parliament. It gives rise to livelier debates, and there is nothing in the Rules of Procedure to prevent this approach from being used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of this Parliament will be aware of the very high degree of public interest in this issue and of the lobbying to which we have all been subjected. I am not against that lobbying – a lively parliament should welcome lobbying from all sides.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But the situation regarding this particular directive is unusual and serious. Firstly, the rapporteur, Mrs Müller, who has done her job very gallantly, has been subjected to unacceptable harassment and threats. Lies have been disseminated as to her motivation. Secondly, the people in question, led by Dr Rath from Germany, have practised deception on Parliament. They gained entry as a news team to the committee meeting when her report was adopted, and used the material to make a video that caricatures the views of the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I ask you to consider what can be done about this. I would like to ask the Presidency to find a means of dealing with such excessive, fraudulent and oppressive approaches.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in this instance they have done more harm than good, as Mrs McKenna has said; and it has to be said that there is a perfectly good case against this directive; but we need to put in place a procedure, as a parliament, to guard ourselves in the future. In some national parliaments in this instance the person concerned would certainly be called before the parliament, reprimanded and asked to apologise, and we might consider putting that in place.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But given the fact that there are now electronic means to overwhelm us with lobbying, we need to do something. I ask the President of Parliament to consider this very urgently.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur has now tabled Amendment No 25, which is a compromise amendment. However, with one exception, these amendments are mutually compatible. The problem is that they refer to different dates. The amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy refer to 30 June 2002. Mrs Paulsen's Amendment No 25 says "before the entry into force of this regulation", and that is what we are voting on now. I would like to table an oral amendment to the effect that in the two amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy the date should be changed to "before the entry into force of this regulation".</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the Commission said that it would not take on board either Amendments Nos 1 and 10 or Amendment No 25. So there will be a clash between us anyway, and that is why it is important for us to vote on all three amendments in this way. However, even if this oral amendment is defeated by the required majority – and I am saying this now so that I do not have to speak again later on – we can still vote on these amendments, because this date does not tie the Commission's hands. It has the right of initiative and can decide anyway. It is simply a recommendation, and if that does not go through, then I am in favour of us still adopting all three amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I would like to speak at three different stages: first now about the block vote, then later on about Amendment No 162 and then once again on amendments Nos 149 and 184. These are not comments on the substance, but rather comments about the adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like at this point to comment on the first block: we have just rejected the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party's Amendment No 173 in a roll-call vote. The problem that we have here is that in committee we did not make a decision on this subject as regards electricity, but we did in the case of gas. The Liberal Group has now tried, in parallel, to do the same thing for electricity as we have already done for gas. We rejected that. However, we now have Amendment No 147, which belongs to this block, and which covers exactly the same substantive point that we rejected in the case of electricity. We are bringing forward something for gas that we do not want to bring forward in the case of electricity – the progress of market opening, as proposed by the committee. However, we still want to defer the opening of the gas market somewhat as compared with electricity. We are now creating an inconsistency around precisely this point. That means that by analogy we should be opposing Amendment No 147, but I simply do not know how we do that procedurally speaking, because in the voting list that is included in the block. That is why you, Mr President, have to decide now whether we should take Amendment No 147 out and vote on it separately; in that case, by analogy with the vote just taken, it would also have to be rejected. I hope that was confusing enough for you!</p>

It is just about correcting something. The intention of Amendment No 162, a joint PSE and PPE-DE amendment, is to bring what we agreed for electricity in line with what we are now agreeing on for gas. It is word for word what we agreed earlier on for electricity. But because of the way the voting list works, that means that we first have to vote against the committee's amendment and then vote for Amendment No 162. However, a mistake has crept in along the way. This is exactly what we agreed for electricity on Article 8(5). Amendment No 162 now also reads "Article 8(5)". However, for gas it is not Article 8(5) but Article 7a(1), and so of course that needs to be inserted there from the Minutes; this is just a technical adjustment.</p>

<p class="contents">But enough joking. We have just voted on the relevant part in relation to electricity. This is found in the committee's amendment. The amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party attempts to remove the discrepancies between Article 14, which relates to the gas sector, and Article 22. I must say that this is certainly necessary if we are to be rigorous here. However, if we now only voted on the PPE-DE's amendment, the key point concerning the electricity sector would be lost. Conversely, if we were to vote as shown here in the voting list, according to which if Amendment No 149 is accepted Amendment No 184 becomes redundant, then we would once again have the problem of a lack of consistency with the other article. That is the reason for the following proposal, and I have agreed this with the mover, who can confirm this. We should first of all vote on Amendment No 149 from the committee, and the PPE-DE Group will then withdraw its amendment except for the part that eliminates this inconsistency. This would then be added to Amendment No 149. We would then have eliminated the inconsistency between electricity and gas and the internal inconsistency in the case of gas.</p>

Similarly, we made a small error in Amendment No 52, in which two words have been omitted from the written version. However, in the case of Amendment No 52 in particular, this goes a long way towards meeting the wishes of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.

We need to adhere to the planned target dates and weight limits, as they will make it possible to liberalise the postal sector, with all the advantages to be gained from fair competition, in a gradual and organised way. As always, if areas of public services are to be liberalised, the opening process needs to be carefully controlled and implemented with regard to security of supply and social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise worked out in committee concerning the production of regular reports on the application of the directive as a source of information for future development is therefore to be welcomed. Nevertheless, the economic, social and territorial consequences of the liberalisation process need to be taken into account when making policy.

<p class="contents">First the Commission and then the Council of Ministers showed that they are either unaware of or systematically underestimate the fact that alongside and in addition to the service which they provide to the public, the postal services play a significant social role in all of the Member States and in all of the regions of the Union. On the pretext of liberalising the service, we are depriving the public – and first and foremost its most disadvantaged members – of social support which is nevertheless essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament had, moreover, rejected the initial proposals put to it. Those which have been put to the vote today contain improvements, but they do not remove the threat to society; quite the opposite, it is becoming increasingly clear that no provision has been made for funding the universal service or for compensating for the inequalities caused by nature. To make matters worse, the massive job losses which will be the direct result of the measures being recommended will compound the violence which is already doing serious damage to European society.</p>

<p class="contents">It is all the more regrettable, as is so often the case, that the Commission's position is, in essence, perfectly unilateral and open to dispute. It has not furnished the proof that opening up postal distribution to full competition would be profitable overall in a country like France. And yet this is the objective towards which it is leading us <span class="italic">de facto</span>. And by what right? Just as it would appear justifiable that the Commission should wish to concern itself with cross-border mail distribution, so it seems to us that internal distribution should be the responsibility of each State.</p>
<p class="contents">Such distinctions do not exist, however, in the eyes of the Commission. Commissioner Bolkestein has just explained to this House that we need to "move forward towards the completion of the internal market for postal services". Does not this internal market exist today? Is it not possible to send a letter from France to Denmark or the United Kingdom easily and inexpensively? All of this is laughable. The internal market already exists and Commissioner Bolkestein is only betraying the fact that, for the Commission, the real objective is quite different: it is unification, of which we have no need whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue raises another general question: the interface between the Commission's competence in matters of competition (where it now enjoys inordinate powers) and the Member States' competence to organise national public services. We think that, where there is any uncertainty, it is the State that should have the last word, provided of course that it has the clear support of the public. We must not allow the Commission to develop and impose a megalomaniac vision of its competences in the field of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Convention which is going to meet to discuss the future of Europe should add this important issue to its agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would therefore pass a favourable judgment on this progress: we now have not inconsiderable guarantees on the accessibility and quality of the universal service, in terms of a minimum set of products being supplied as part of the universal service and in terms of the universal service being adaptable to new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there remain some doubts, questions and concerns about striking the right balance between the public service and the market, about maintaining the postal network in our towns and villages and about the tariffs applied.

<p class="contents">The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, is unsatisfactory, indeed even unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment is unsatisfactory because it calls for a unilateral evaluation, which would be made by the Commission alone, and not, as I would have wished, a more controversial one carried out by all of the stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable because it rejects Parliament's initial proposal to limit the next stage of liberalisation to 150g and four times the basic tariff, and yet does not give any guarantee that a high level of social cohesion will be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable because this amendment refuses to tackle the problem of the conditions under which access will be available to the networks of the new operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is unacceptable because this amendment refuses to raise the issue of how the universal service will be funded; in fact if there is a legitimate request it is surely that of funding: we actually have a right to know how the universal service will be funded, which is to say how the universal service will be able to be guaranteed as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I will vote in favour of the common position for lack of anything better, because if we were to try to amend the text again we would run the risk of seeing the common position fail; we would therefore be running the risk of not having any directive on postal services and consequently of this sector being fully liberalised within two years.</p>

We had tried to convince those who, although they supported the public service, explained to us that the essentials had been safeguarded. This was without reckoning with the Commission and the governments' firm desire to liberalise and then to privatise all of our public services. There is no acceptable compromise on either the timetable or the scope of the liberalisation. That is why we voted to reject the common position and we will continue to defend the postal service as a public service. This is the only position which guarantees continued high quality for users and free access for everyone, in particular for those living in rural and working-class areas. It is the only position which safeguards jobs: by adopting this directive alone, Members are opening the way for 450 000 jobs to be cut in this sector in Europe, including 50 000 in France. It is now time to mobilise the public, workers and their organisations against the liberal dogma of treating our needs and fundamental rights as commodities and to impose a public postal service which is coordinated at European level and placed in the hands of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are vital utilities, and competition would interfere with their being continuously available to all at an affordable price. One would expect that advocates of political and economic unification would strive towards the integration of public postal companies of all the Member States and towards single European stamps. Instead, the co-existence of different postal companies in the neo-liberal phase is being used to allow these companies to compete with each other and, in addition, to open the door to American or Australian companies, or to new companies which offer poorer services at lower prices under poorer working conditions. Twenty years from now, after take-overs and bankruptcies, there will be three global concerns in charge, and mandatory protection of staff, the environment and consumers will prove impossible. At first reading, the majority of the EP rejected a further weight decrease of postage under 150 grams for distribution in a competitive market, as well as more far-reaching forms of liberalisation in due course. At the risk of the European Commission applying other rules which offer yet less protection to a universal provision of services, after years of protest, the social democrats are now finally resigned to these unsatisfactory plans.

<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, it omits the essential point: nothing is said about the Council's right to approve this same work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Malmström report shows firstly that, as the European Parliament becomes more powerful, the Commission's monopoly on the right of initiative weighs increasingly heavy on it. It therefore seeks to impose its own priorities. This desire had, moreover, caused some tension last December when the Commission presented its programme for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament, which has just been adopted, sets out a timetable for the year n-1 for us to work together to draft the work programme for the year n. This is a good initiative. But it raises a further question: where is the equivalent timetable for a dialogue with the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">Such a timetable would be even more justified, and for three reasons: 1) the Council is the European institution with the deepest democratic roots because it is based on national parliaments; 2) theoretically, unlike the European Parliament, it already has real power to push forward and guide the work of the Commission, pursuant to Article 4 of the TEU; 3) finally, the Council has an overview of the work which needs to be done at European level across the three pillars of the Treaty, including the initiatives taken by Member States in the intergovernmental pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of clarification on this point, the Malmström report appears more than anything to be a manœuvre by the two old connivers, the Commission and the European Parliament, to throw out the primordial rights of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both a scientific theory and an economic interest underlie these. The theory of Linus Pauling, who became renowned for his protest against nuclear arms, is interesting. However, the economic interest of Mathias Rath, who dispatches products from the Netherlands to customers in Germany, where his products are banned, cannot justify an adaptation of the law. These food supplements should be subject to the same rules as other contentious products which are consumed by the public in the expectation that these will benefit their health. Government intervention is only justified to protect people from harm. On-going debates, lack of scientific certainty and permanent differences of opinion on the effectiveness of substances cannot be resolved by legislation which from the outset lumps together anything which deviates from established medical science under the umbrella of fraudulent practices. I note that many people use these products and that they consider any ban imposed by a bureaucratic government to be unnecessary and patronising.

I am pleased that the European Parliament has agreed with this approach, even if it has been by a narrow margin.

That means that the codecision procedure will be invoked and that we can deal with this by means of a regulation of our own. I wish to call on those Member States that have not so far called for a ban to make sure that these substances, which are dangerous if they are not properly treated, are properly disposed of. I expect that during the transitional period until a regulation governing all this is submitted, the Commission will use its control functions to make sure that we do not have a repeat of the disasters that we have already experienced – foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever – which can be caused by untreated catering waste.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to make two essential remarks on the points which I advocated in the parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's decisions must be consistent. In the interests of efficiency, it is therefore appropriate not to have a proliferation of regulations on the same subjects. In laying down provisions for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 already subjects animal by-products from slaughterhouses handling ruminants and cutting plants handling meat from ruminants to rigorous and controlled health rules. Consequently, to ensure consistency and the correct application of the rules, there is no reason to include these facilities in the scope of a second regulation with the same objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's decisions must also be possible to implement. In fact we already know that, because of treatment and disposal capacity (incineration or landfill), measures which have to be implemented at too short notice cannot be applied at Community level if they cover effluent – whether category 1 or category 2 – from wastewater treatment plants at slaughterhouses, which are often shared facilities. These shortcomings mainly came to light when the ban on animal meal in animal feed was imposed, forcing the Member States to store large quantities of animal meal while waiting for it to be incinerated. Adding several million tonnes of products to be disposed of or treated before processing would impose further constraints on storage because it is not possible to treat or incinerate them as required. And we know that storage can involve health and environmental risks. It is therefore necessary to put in place an adequate timetable allowing this to be managed at Community level in a way which is well thought-out, safe and respectful of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The BSE crisis of recent years must never again threaten European consumers, farmers and the beef industry. I believe that great credit is due to the Commission for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each and every one of the issues surrounding the original crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States have taken the necessary steps, with the full co-operation of the farming community and the beef industry, to guarantee safe farming and food production practices and a safe product for the European consumer as well as for our vital export markets. Many actions and measures taken have brought with them great sacrifice and we must remain conscious of that.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular proposal aims to establish a single legal framework to clarify conditions for treating animal by-products. Most importantly, the only by-products which should end up in animal feed, and consequently the food chain, are those by-products which would be fit for direct human consumption. In other words, if you can’t put a spoon of the stuff in your cup of cocoa at night then you shouldn’t be feeding it to the pigs either.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of Parliament representing a largely rural constituency, and coming from Ireland, the Member State most heavily dependent on agriculture, I fully endorse the stringent thrust of this proposal. I strongly believe that there must be a complete ban on the feeding of swill to pigs. We have seen the damage that can be wreaked from a more lax approach. I am also convinced of the need to ban recovered vegetable oils from all feed uses.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great merit in the rapporteur’s suggestion that household catering waste be exempt from the provisions of these regulations with regard to transport, identification etc and that they be covered by national rules and the Framework Directive on Waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of waste water from slaughter houses, I believe that this must be reviewed as it covers a huge quantity of material for disposal. Defining “sludge” in the Annex might help clarify the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to assure the Commissioner that he has the full support of Parliament in this important area of food safety. In this regard I would urge him to exert some pressure on the Council to come to a final decision as to the location of the all-important Food Safety Authority. Protection of European consumers, and of the integrity of the food chain, remain at the heart of the concerns of Members of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means awarding the prize of supplying electricity to more than 300 million Europeans to large private groups. Not content with this, but perfectly consistent with this approach, the rapporteur recommends passing on the costs of opening up the national networks to the private sector to consumers throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are resolutely opposed to privatisation of the generation and supply of electricity, as we are to the privatisation of all public services, which the Member States and the European institutions are so keen to achieve, because this policy can only be to the detriment of the interests of both the workers in the sectors concerned and the vast majority of consumers.</p>

<p class="contents">In spite of all this, following the request made by the European Council at its Lisbon Summit for rapid progress towards the completion of the single market in gas and electricity, the Commission has presented a communication, a draft regulation and a draft directive designed to speed up the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market with a view to the establishment of an entirely open market in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Stockholm Summit, the Member States approved this acceleration, with the exception of France, which is strongly opposed to the adoption of that date.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to speed up the opening of the electricity market so as to give non-residential customers a free choice of supplier by 1 January 2003 and to extend the same opportunity to all electricity consumers not later than the beginning of January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of gas, free choice of supplier is to be available to non-residential customers by 1 January 2004 and to all consumers by the start of January 2005.</p>

<p class="contents">If there had been just a Turmes report instead of the Rapkay-Turmes report we now have before us, it would not have seen the light of day in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course in agreement with the three major objectives of the process of liberalising the electricity and gas industry, and our message to the Barcelona Summit about this was clear and undisputed. It is as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">1) we want to ensure that consumers are free to choose their suppliers;</p>
<p class="contents">2) we want to guarantee that all suppliers have fair and transparent access to all networks;</p>
<p class="contents">3) we want to see a binding system in all Member States in order to underpin the objective described in point 2.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Turmes felt that in his part of the report, which covered the electricity industry, he should set out his entire ideology and the Greens' wish list in this area, which have nothing to do with the actual subject matter. His report therefore misses the point. Like my colleagues, I voted against these parts of the resolution. Because we are now involved in the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council, Mr Turmes has, with his Red-Green wish list, not done a great service to the subject at hand here, by which I mean a reasonable and balanced liberalisation of the EU electricity market.</p>

This is a comment in connection with the Mombaur report. As transpired yesterday – much to the chagrin of the spokesperson of the PPE-DE Group – the rapporteurs Turmes and Rapkay have made proposals to moderate the effects of the Mombaur report. Their intention is noble, but difficult to implement, because it aims to combine two incompatible objectives. They accept more emphasis on market forces, which centre on growth and profits, while trying to protect the environment and consumers. I welcome their attempt to give customers a percentage breakdown in their bills and in information leaflets explaining the origin of electricity and the effects on the production of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, and to apply this to imported energy. I also support financial measures to promote investments in total energy and windmills. I am less keen on the importance being accorded to attempts also to liberalise biogas and to ensure that environmental obligations do not restrict competition between companies, although this may be a concession to the majority in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Although I reject the circumstances under which this proposal has been made, unlike my group, I gladly support it in the absence of anything better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even more significant for European consumers will be the proposed non-discriminatory access to networks for different competitors. Basic economics tells us that more competition for networks should result in an eventual decrease in prices: good news for some consumers who, in the present system, end up paying over the odds. This is equally goods news for small energy companies who are sometimes deterred from further expansion owing to high market entry costs.

<p class="contents">1. I am extremely sceptical about Commissioner de Palacio’s point of view regarding the concept of liberalisation seen as a ‘deregulated deregulation’. It expresses no interest or vigilance any more than the social regard that we have for the liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">2. This report, contrary to what one might think, concerns more than just technical issues. It concerns the daily lives of millions of citizens who, in future, will not be able to count on having a uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, which are some of the public services that each State, and now Europe, made a commitment to provide.</p>
<p class="contents">3. We have a duty to guarantee the security of the network, to ensure that the service and the prices paid by domestic consumers is protected and that private producers or distributors make investments under their contractual obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">4. What image will we give of a Europe where we boast about the opening of the market and reduced prices for consumers when a large part of the population may be unable to gain access to these?</p>
<p class="contents">5. The Commission’s resistance to the single tariff regardless of place of residence and the meaning of this vote express a fear of the harmful effects of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">6. This also means that we are and will remain vigilant so that the right to energy for all and the protection of citizens’ public services are guaranteed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, we are on our way to the generation and distribution by international concerns on which democracy has no effect whatsoever. The drawbacks have meanwhile become glaringly obvious in America, especially in the power cuts in California and in the bankruptcy case of Enron. But in Europe too, the adverse effects are already being felt. The Dutch energy companies, until recently in the hands of municipalities and provinces, have made considerable investments in the environmentally-friendly generation of electricity. This clean production is now being considered too expensive, and dirty electricity is being imported via the cross-border connection network, which originates from pit coal, brown coal and nuclear energy. This connection network was installed some time ago to allow Member States to help each other in the event of disaster and in cases of peaks in the use of electricity, but its capacity is now being used completely for the purpose of international trade. This is why I disagree with the purport of the Mombaur report on cross-border electricity trade, even if through the proposals by Turmes and Rapkay more attention is paid to keeping track of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, to promoting windmills and total energy, and to consumer protection. These objectives will ultimately not be compatible, which is why I am voting against the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, aircraft noise has become a plague to an increasing proportion of the population. The more a region is forced to rely on air traffic for its transport needs, the greater the burden becomes in terms of damage to health. The only ways to combat this nuisance are to restrict air traffic to long-distance flights, to create greater distances between airports and residential areas, to accord lower priority to economic growth or world trade and to ban noisy aircraft. Clearly, America and the Third World have different views on noise pollution. The Third World is too poor to consider matters of this kind, and in affluent America, company profits are more important than any other considerations. Anyone truly wishing to restrict noise pollution in Europe should not be content with the agreement that was recently concluded on a global scale within the ICAO, but should set higher standards themselves, if necessary. The proposal to withdraw the aforementioned Hushkits Regulation from 1 April onwards mainly aims to avoid a trade war with America. I share the view of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Blokland, that this proposal does not go far enough and that it continues to permit exceptions for too long a term.

Anti-EU campaigns in countries such as Ireland have clearly demonstrated the need for a positive communication strategy. Moreover, the practical policy prescriptions outlined in this report show that the EU is serious about becoming closer to European citizens and countering the common perception that it is run by an elite bureaucracy. Focusing on issues which affect people's daily lives, such as food safety, the euro and justice and home affairs, will ensure that citizens fully engage in the debate about Europe. Moreover, the focus on decentralisation in this communication exchange is pertinent: regions vary dramatically across the EU and local authorities are attuned to regional needs and issues of local importance. They are clearly the best placed to disseminate information about the EU. Similarly, it is vital that regional TV should be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the call for more Internet use in the information campaign will ensure that this campaign is not only cost-effective but environmentally sound, too. Since the European Parliament is the European institution closest to European citizens, it would make sense for it to become the institution around which this information campaign revolves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main focus is on religious fundamentalism, with other forms of fundamentalism only being given a brief mention. Even if religious fundamentalism is the most significant form and stands out from other forms, it is nevertheless essential to recognise all forms of fundamentalism if a meaningful debate is to take place. The threats posed by fundamentalism are growing in a way that the events of 11 September suggest involve an enormous contempt for humanity. However, to do justice to the situation we cannot limit ourselves to religious aspects alone. Just as people obsessed with a fundamental order are to be found in all walks of life, this way of thinking is also prevalent throughout society.</p>

<p class="contents">It was originally a matter of reaffirming our desire to ensure that women’s rights are rigorously respected throughout the territory of all the Member States at a time when huge influxes of unassimilated immigrants are prone to import practices that are degrading to women or are tantamount to cruel torture, such as female circumcision.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European Parliament ultimately shied away from naming the plague that besets us, namely floods of unassimilated immigrants, often from countries with an Islamic culture. Faced with this predicament, Parliament has taken refuge in sanitised statements or, even worse, has issued sweeping condemnations which seem to apply to all Europeans without distinction and which imbue everyone with an unwarranted sense of guilt.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the concept of fundamentalism itself. Under that heading, the report blithely lumps together the rigorous practice of Christianity, a religion that places the individual at the heart of society, and the rigorous practice of another religion, Islam, which subordinates the individual to the community. But these are not the same phenomenon at all.</p>
<p class="contents">To crown it all, the European Parliament recommends that the forthcoming directives on the right of asylum, based on the Treaty of Amsterdam, provide for reception of women from all parts of the world who suffer from ‘fundamentalist persecution’.

On the report as a whole, however, we abstained.</p>

Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can appear in many guises. It can be religious, political or ideological. We do not stress often enough that women are the chief victims of fundamentalism and that this state of affairs frequently arouses utter indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Union has to condemn this phenomenon in third countries, it must not presume to lecture the rest of the world, because it is confronted with fundamentalism within its own territory. This is confirmed by the massive floods of e-mails that have inundated Members of the European Parliament and in which we are being urged to reject this report on the grounds that it is ‘a threat to the dignity of women and to the right to life of every human being until his or her natural death’.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I support the demand contained in this report for promotion of equal rights for women, particularly the right of women to exercise control over their own bodies and to decide when they wish to start a family, to determine their own lifestyle and the nature of their personal relationships. It appears equally imperative that the Member States should adopt legislation outlawing any practices that endanger the health or the physical and mental integrity of women, such as female circumcision.</p>
<p class="contents">Who could fail to recall the human misery into which the Taliban plunged the eleven million women of Afghanistan in 1996? Imprisoned behind their chadors, deprived of education and care, subjected to public floggings, they endured an existence beyond the bounds of human dignity in order to survive. It is our duty to exert pressure on the new government in order to ensure that the political wind of change sweeping through Afghanistan is translated into a genuine improvement in the position of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The struggle for the recognition of women’s rights should be an integral part of the foreign policy of the European Union. I am thinking here of the way in which we implement the MEDA programme and the Lomé Convention. The human rights clause is too often allowed to remain a dead letter for fear that its implementation would jeopardise the success of particular economic or trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has given us many avenues to explore in the fight against fundamentalism.

I am therefore against fundamentalism as the expression of a way of thinking that denies a person – man or woman – their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny, and It is my view that the European Union must, with every means at its disposal, uphold and promote respect for human rights wherever they are violated.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, accept the implicit censure of religious values and actual religion that the Izquierdo report makes, under cover of its censure of fundamentalism – and not only in relation to Christianity. It is one thing to freely espouse religious principles that accord with respect for human rights; it is quite another to impose rules of behaviour that entail the negation of individual dignity and the infringement of such rights. It is one thing to support the separation of Church and State, a position I fully share because it is the basis of the democratic system, but quite another to deny the Church and religious communities their right to freedom of expression in the name of secularity – in other words their right to interpret, according to their way of thinking, the facts of public and political life that govern citizens’ lives.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this report today, the European Parliament has done the cause of the freedoms we wish to promote no favours, because behind the censure of fundamentalism there is in fact a new form of fundamentalism that they are trying to impose on us: secular fundamentalism, which is just as deserving of censure as any other, in that they all deny the freedom of the individual to choose his or her own model in life. This is the reason why I voted against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are undoubtedly good elements, such as the principle that fundamentalism must not be fought with other types of fundamentalism of an opposite kind (recital M). But the report also contains bad things and some very bad things.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is astonishing to note that this report, which was originally devoted to Islam and women, has now been renamed. The reason for this was undoubtedly to avoid shocking anyone and to comply with the sacrosanct dictates of political correctness. Moreover, to create a stronger sense of guilt among us, recital A recalls that ‘the concept of fundamentalism originated in the 1920s in the USA, where it primarily referred to Christianity’. The eleven million Afghan women who were banned from all public places, deprived of education, barred from professional activity, deprived of care and exposed to beatings and floggings in the years when the fundamentalist Taliban ruled their country have a different story to tell about the origins of fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, the European Parliament presumes to lecture us on moral theology. On what authority? With what qualifications? How can it put religion and fundamentalism, the exercise of spiritual and temporal power, on the same footing? The report systematically equates religion with fundamentalism in utter disregard of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, in fact, is a hotchpotch of hackneyed ideas, all of which have the same purpose, namely the inversion of decent values and the promotion of decadence. What can I say, for example, about paragraph 33, which calls on the heads of Christian churches to legitimise lesbianism? This report is also yet another stepping stone in the pro-immigration policy pursued by Brussels. In fact, by some sleight of hand, paragraphs 18, 19, 21 and 24 use the fight against fundamentalism as a pretext to demand greater flexibility for governments to grant asylum to women from countries where fundamentalism is rife as well as using the framework of a preventive policy to secure the rapid social integration of the immigrants, refugees and minorities who are resident in the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and many others besides, we must reject this report and resist any attempts by Parliament to replace it, under cover of the struggle against religious fundamentalism, with another report, which may be even more arbitrary than this one and which is the fruit of the fickle convictions and hostility to the natural order that characterise the present majority of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the report before us does not do justice to these problems and creates the impression that fundamentalism is the hallmark only of certain religions. The political, social and ideological fundamentalism directed at women with such devastating consequences for their quality of life has been ignored. Narrowing the scope of the report in this way is contrary to the Christian ethical order of values. This one-sidedly anti-religious approach means that an opportunity to deal appropriately with this important subject, "Women and fundamentalism", has been missed. The report is unbalanced, contradictory and undifferentiated, and accordingly totally undermines the battle against discrimination against women. Freedom of religion and protection against discrimination are key aspects of fundamental rights that cannot be played off against each other, and that is why I voted against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also nurtured the hope that this report might provide a valuable contribution that would push things in the right direction wherever a push was needed. Regrettably, our rapporteur and those who followed her lead have squandered a great opportunity; this is illustrated, incidentally, by the fact that the report was adopted by only 15 votes to 7 in the Committee on Women’s Rights, while the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was adopted by 18 votes with 11 abstentions.</p>
<p class="contents">The two women rapporteurs are members of the Socialist Group in this Parliament. The uncooperative approach of the rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and indeed her obstinate determination not to listen to reason and to throw everything into the one pot, if I may say so, means that I cannot vote in favour of this report; for one thing, it indiscriminately accuses all religions for practising a pernicious form of fundamentalism, and another, more important reason is that it seeks to manipulate this resolution to define details of the asylum and immigration policies of the European Union.</p>

This leads to slavery, racism, colonial wars, child labour, subsistence wages for workers, underpayment for raw materials and the withholding of equal rights for women. In order to maintain their position, some privileged parties draw on quotes from the Bible or the Koran which are supposed to justify their misconduct. Only in the past few centuries have women in different European countries acquired the same rights as men, such as the right to vote, the right to work, rights to equal remuneration, access to managerial roles, the right to dissolve a failed marriage and equal rights of inheritance. There is still a rearguard of men who are opposed to this. New to us is the increase – through immigration – of the number of men originating from cultures who oppose gender equality. Some of them keep their daughters at home, marry them off and penalise them for looking for contact with boys independently. I fully endorse the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities not to use family law from the countries of origin as a basis, not to support the States that discriminate against women and also to bring women who are persecuted on grounds of gender under the asylum law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
