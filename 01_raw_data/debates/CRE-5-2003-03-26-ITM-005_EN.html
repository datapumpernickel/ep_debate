This was the third European Council summit meeting with this agenda. As you all know, the objective of the Lisbon strategy is to make the European economy the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the Council was convened, the view was expressed that this Council should not meet or that it should deal solely with the war in Iraq. The Presidency did not agree with these views. We have a direct interest in developments in Iraq. We are particularly concerned that there should be no human casualties and we are particularly concerned about the civilian population in Iraq. However, this does not mean that we should abandon our main mission, by which I mean our policies for economic development and employment in Europe, especially in the current climate of recession and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would have been wrong to allow the summit to become a casualty of the war. That would have played right into the hands of all those who take pleasure in highlighting Europe's inability to cope with crucial situations.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simitis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>The European Council concluded that the slowdown in the economy had lasted longer than anticipated and that the current prospects of a recovery were overshadowed by the war, global political risks and economic uncertainties. The European Council also concluded that considerable progress had been made with the Lisbon agenda, now entering its fourth year. For example, five million new jobs have been created since the start of the Lisbon strategy – 500 000 of them in 2002 despite the less favourable economic climate, with unemployment declining by 2 million. Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives. A great deal of effort is needed if we are to push ahead with our economic and social reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council set four priorities: to raise employment and social cohesion is the first priority. By reforming tax and benefit systems and increasing incentives for labour market participation and incentives to encourage the labour markets to be more adaptable to changing economic conditions and, of course, by paying attention to social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. This means increasing company expenditure on research, facilitating the creation of companies that focus on innovation, improving their access to finance, reducing administrative burdens and encouraging the spirit of enterprise among young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is to strengthen the single market and connect Europe. We need to open up the European energy, transport and financial services markets and improve the regulatory framework and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The final priority is environmental protection for growth and jobs. This means taking action in the environmental field and promoting new investments in clean and more resource-efficient technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that, as the conclusions show, considerable progress has been made with the Lisbon strategy during the Greek Presidency. For example, significant results have been obtained as regards agreeing on better coordination of budgetary policies, agreeing on a transparent and cheap Community patent, fourteen years in the making, putting into place an integrated Europe-wide financial market, setting the direction for the revised European Employment Strategy, introducing a Tripartite Social Summit, establishing a Tripartite Social Summit, agreeing on energy taxation and setting targets in sectors such as renewable energy, increased energy efficiency and bio-fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council issued guidelines. The conclusions contain guidelines on how to achieve the objectives I have mentioned. In 2003, the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments. What are they? The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, the Employment Guidelines and the Internal Market Strategy. The Council ordered these tools to be streamlined and coordinated and to be given a three-year perspective, in order to make them more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council took a series of decisions in specific sectors, such as employment and modernising the European social model. The Council urged the Member States to maintain the momentum of reform of national labour markets. As I said, it stressed the need to reform tax systems in order to promote employment and increase labour demand in Europe, improve the wage and salary formation system, so that they take into account the relationship between wages, price stability, productivity, training levels and labour market conditions, modernise employment legislation, taking account of the need for both greater flexibility and greater security and improve labour mobility over occupations, sectors, regions and across borders, for example by improving transparency and recognition between systems of vocational education.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this sector, the European Council invited the Commission to establish a special European Employment Taskforce, headed by Mr Wim Kok, to propose specific measures to increase employment. The Council also touched on all the other sectors which constitute the Lisbon strategy: knowledge, innovation, entrepreneurship, competitiveness, and set certain deadlines for completing various reforms. Finally, I should like to mention that it laid down substantive regulations on safety at sea in the wake of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this – very briefly – was the outcome of discussions on the Lisbon strategy. Now I should like to say something on the subject of Iraq. It is a known fact that all the Member States of the European Union demanded the disarmament of Iraq and the destruction of any weapons of mass destruction it may have had. It is also a known fact that there is acute disagreement as to how and when disarmament will take place. This issue was discussed repeatedly in the Security Council without any agreement being reached. On the contrary, the divisions widened. It would therefore have been pointless for the Presidency to hope that the differences which have emerged over all the past few months would be overcome at the Council. On the contrary, it felt that, with the beginning of the military conflict, principles needed to be laid down for dealing with the situation caused by the start of war and that we should be thinking about the future and the aftermath of the crisis in order to preclude new divisions, in order to set clear, common objectives, in order to limit the repercussions of the war and avoid a chain reaction of crises and in order to be able to work once the war ends. That is our objective. Peace and progress in the region. At the beginning, this effort was met with doubt. Could we discuss this sort of agenda? However, the Council achieved a common position, pointing out, among other things, the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq, the need to address the major humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the conflict, the need for our solidarity with the countries affected by it and the central role of the United Nations, both in dealing with the Iraqi crisis and in the international system in general. The Security Council, the conclusions state, will need to give the United Nations a mandate to deal with the post-war period.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point was the need to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process, our determination to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy and the importance of the transatlantic partnership. Is the fact that we steered clear of the main problem a sign of hypocrisy, as some have suggested? No, it is not. The differences of opinion on the main problem were clear. The impasse was also clear. There was no point in discussing it. We needed to focus our attention elsewhere: to what is important for the future. And that is what we did.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps some people would have preferred to widen the gap, to add more fuel to the fire? We believe that, now that the war has raised even more questions, the European Union has a duty to send out a message about restoring peace in the region and dealing with the aftermath of the war. The future is every bit as important as the present. If we fail to address it, we shall find ourselves on a very slippery slope. Is the Union of Europe split at the moment? Yes, it is. However, the answer is not to exacerbate the divide, the answer is to try and highlight where we can work together and pull in the same direction. The decision on Iraq was a decision based on the premise that the European Union has a voice and must have a voice in international affairs. It is therefore a symbol of the efforts being made to create a balanced Euro-Atlantic relationship in which Europe maintains its independence, takes special initiatives and has its own role. That we want an independent Europe is clear from another point in the conclusions referring to greater research capabilities in the defence sector and the creation of a European defence capabilities development and acquisition agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what is our objective? To get international relations working in a more widely acceptable manner at international level as quickly as possible. This presupposes that the United Nations, through its institutions, will issue the main guidelines on what is to happen after the war in Iraq. Its reinstatement from a challenged to an unchallenged international legal system will be achieved if it is clear that the United Nations are against taking on a central role. The decision emphasises the central role of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">With the differences of opinion over Iraq, numerous people concluded, sadly, that we have no common foreign policy. But that is not strictly true. There are common positions on numerous foreign policy issues. On other issues, and on aspects of certain more general issues, the Union's foreign policy is taking shape. Policies in other sectors are also taking shape. And there are also divisions in other sectors. From the common agricultural policy through to immigration policy. And yet no one ever said that the European Union was superfluous because it failed to agree on the directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers or on how to deal with economic migrants seeking asylum or, finally, on changes to the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is constantly taking shape. That is why its development is a challenge, a challenge to think, to apply our knowledge and experience and work for a prosperous, secure future. The war in Iraq, which we have to deal with, is part of that challenge, which is why we cannot merely welcome or condemn it. We also need to look at the future prospects of Europe and the world. Our ambition in today's world is to put an end to war, to the reign of terror, to threats to man and his environment, by creating rules of global intergovernmentalism. The United Nations have not yet managed to become a convincing, efficient institution, even though they are charged with addressing issues which are vital to the global community. And it will be some time before they do. National chauvinism is extremely powerful, which is why we have a political duty to continue to strengthen the role of the European Union, thereby helping at European and global level to consolidate the process of peace, cooperation and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels Summit showed that, despite our differences, we still feel Europe is the best way of preventing one new superpower from monopolising our cosmos. Europe's ability to participate and influence a multipolar world must be kept alive with initiatives, cooperation and a belief in our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">The spring Council in Brussels may not have answered questions, but it issued guidelines which will allow us to put Europe's role into practice, if we cooperate, if we live in harmony together, if we fight together for a multipolar world.</p>

I therefore wish to express particularly heartfelt thanks and appreciation to Prime Minister Simitis and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Papandreou, for their skilful and sensitive handling of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spring European Council is the time in the Union’s yearly calendar when it traditionally looks at economic issues, but the Iraq crisis cast a shadow over the whole of the Council held in recent days in Brussels. I will therefore begin my speech today with that.</p>
<p class="contents">As I speak, a war is under way and no one can tell how much longer it will last. A war in which troops from some Member States are fighting in the region. A war that has caused great divisions within the Union. A war opposed by the overwhelming majority of European citizens and very many others throughout the world. A war which, like all wars, brings death and suffering in its train, even if it ultimately brings the fall of a dictator. First of all, I wish to express the Commission's – and my own – sympathy to those families who mourn loved ones and to all who have suffered as a result of the war. I also want to reiterate the need for respect for human dignity, even between the belligerents.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear another fact in mind: the extra funds requested for this operation – USD 74.7 billion – are much higher than the total amount of aid the world gives the poorest countries each year, which is only just over EUR 50 billion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The statement on the Iraq crisis adopted at the end of the Council’s work gives a clear list of the many important points on which there is unanimous agreement within the Union. They need to be highlighted in this debate too. They include the central role of the United Nations, both during and after the crisis, combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, respect for Iraq's territorial integrity, the need for urgent action in terms of humanitarian aid, our commitment to multilateral management of world politics and the Atlantic Alliance, which continues to be a strategic priority.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many points we all agree on, then, and they are crucial. We should bear this in mind after all that has been said and written on our divisions in recent days and weeks. However, we must not try to pretend that these divisions are not there. We must not lie to ourselves or to our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Having listed these crucial points on which the Union is in agreement, we must admit that the European Union is going through a very rough patch. I am thinking about the role the Union should be playing and is not. Indeed, the issue of the enlarged Union's foreign and defence policy is starkly highlighted by world events. We must ask ourselves what role we want to play on the world scene. I say ‘want’ because I am convinced that the Union has the means to develop with time into an active, influential international political player, not just economically but in terms of security too, on the basis of the values on which Europe is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with security. The European citizens have already made it clear what they want. They want peace, multilateralism and a Europe – a Europe that brings security as well as peace – and they have made this abundantly clear recently. This is not an emotional reaction at a time of crisis, brought on by the natural anxiety and concern always triggered by war. It goes much deeper, and it would be a sin to ignore it, for it should unite us in purpose. Indeed, the Treaties require the Member States to ‘support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.’ They are, and I quote, to ‘work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity’. They must refrain from ‘any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.’</p>
<p class="contents">How little the letter and the spirit of these Treaty provisions have been observed recently is plain to all. Moreover, this has come at a time when the representatives of all governments, institutions and parliaments meeting within the Convention are working on the Union's new constitutional charter and when the Union's now impending enlargement is bringing new opportunities and imposing new responsibilities. Let me take this opportunity to applaud the positive result of Slovenia's referendum on accession, which has followed closely on Malta's.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the road we have travelled in the last 60 years towards a united Europe has not been easy. There have been many rough patches, but Europe has always drawn courage precisely from its deepest crises and used them as a springboard for its most spectacular advances. It was the failure of the EDC – of the plan to create a European Defence Community – which created the impetus for the Treaty of Rome. It was the United States' decision to float the dollar and the resulting collapse of the whole Bretton Woods system which set Europe on the long road to monetary union. Later, the oil crisis in the 1970s and the currency crisis in the summer of 1992 spurred us first to set up the European Monetary System and then to draft the rules on Economic and Monetary Union in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, history is repeating itself. Europe's future hangs on the way we face this crisis. We could decide to go for a system of international relations based on the balance of power and entrust ourselves to the sovereignty and national interests of the individual European States but, as Commissioner Patten said in this very House, that would be like trying to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century with the instruments and policies of the nineteenth century. Moreover, it would be contrary to the very nature of the Union, which is based on dialogue, solidarity, multilateralism and an inspiring combination of ethics and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">We must decide to carry through Europe's unification and give it the institutions, the instruments and the decision-making mechanisms it needs to make it a genuinely political Union – which is the road our fellow citizens want us to take – a Union that can apply unified policies for the economy, international relations and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of defence, the last few days have brought the launch of an initiative that could take us far. Belgium, France and Germany have decided to look jointly at closer integration. There is a background to this initiative, which these countries are right to say is open to all other Member States, because it must bring us together, not divide us. I am not just referring to the experience consolidated some time ago now in the integration of European armed forces within multinational corps such as the Eurocorps, Eurofor and Euromarfor.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us cast our minds back to Saint Malo in December 1998. A process was set in motion that led to the common European security and defence policy in the space of six short months and thanks to which we can now rely on instruments such as the Political and Security Committee and the Military Committee and Military Staff of the European Union. The countries behind the initiative – I would point out – were France and the United Kingdom, and, thanks to that agreement, the goal of a rapid reaction force of 60 000 troops can now be considered to be within reach. It is the first step towards what people are demanding for the first time in the history of the European institutions: our common defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Convention has created a working group on defence. In its conclusions, the working group stressed the need to develop European defence capabilities and to strengthen the industrial and technological base. Two weeks ago, the Commission adopted a Communication on defence-related industrial and market issues with the aim of facilitating and fostering more effective coordination of a European defence-equipment policy. Lastly, on 18 March 2003, the Council decided to launch the first military operation in the history of the Union and take over from the NATO forces operating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans are not from Venus, as some would suggest. The peoples of this old, wise Europe have a long and painful past. A past that has led us to base our Union on law and to work for an international order founded on right, not on might.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware, however, that humanitarian policies alone are not enough, just as it is not enough to outstrip the other main players in the area of development aid policy. We know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions, until we stop relying on the European Union for economic growth and the United States for security – and there is nothing anti-American in what I am saying, not least because cooperation between the United States and the European Union has greatly increased recently, even in the most sensitive areas. Think of the remarkable cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after September 11 and the constant dialogue between the US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, and our own Commissioner Lamy. Experience shows that European unity is a condition for and a guarantee of effective transatlantic cooperation, and what I am saying stems wholly from a deep conviction that only Europe, only Europeans, can decide what Europe's interests are.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are faced with a crisis, but history has a sense of timing: this challenge may be a deciding moment for Europe but it has come while the Convention is sitting. I therefore call on this House and all the institutions represented in the Convention, and I appeal to all its Members directly not to miss this opportunity. Today as never before, we can seek to forge our own destiny, but we must learn the right lessons from past experience.</p>
<p class="contents">At Maastricht, Europe laid the foundations for both Economic and Monetary Union and the common foreign and security policy, policies which we have too often disregarded. While the former has evolved to the point of putting the euro into the citizens’ pockets, the latter is still in its infancy. The institutions, the instruments and the decision-making mechanisms for implementing the two policies were quite different and so are the results. However much time it may take to fully implement our plans, the moment of truth for Europe's foreign and defence policy has come. The decision demands great far-sightedness and great political courage, but the choice is clear: do we want to be left out, all of us, of the management of world affairs, or do we want to play a part, on an equal footing with our allies, in building a new world order?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I started off today by saying that the Spring European Council is the principle occasion when we review our economic progress each year. This year, there are some encouraging points, and we should not forget the great progress made recently in opening up markets. The process of opening up the telecommunications market is almost complete. The energy market is in the process of being opened up. Great progress has been made on mobility and on many aspects of social security. After years of work there is the agreement on the Community Patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, too, however, we must be honest with ourselves. Our progress in implementing the reform strategy decided at Lisbon three years ago is too slow. I am not just talking about the widespread disappointment on the issue of savings tax. The growth rate of our economies is alarmingly below that required to create the jobs we need and to support the process of convergence of the acceding countries' economies. That is why I told the European Council last Friday, as I am telling you today, that it is time to send a strong, clear signal of our commitment to support growth.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two sectors in which I believe action can and must be taken immediately: Trans-European Networks and research and development. The priorities for the Trans-European Networks were identified some time ago but, to date, they have not brought much in the way of results. Even the 14 projects given priority in 1994 at the Essen European Council are severely behind schedule. Meanwhile, new corridors are needed to take advantage of the opportunities enlargement will bring, as the amount of traffic on our roads and in the tunnels that pass through our mountains is increasing exponentially. Investment in the Trans-European Networks currently stands at below EUR 20 billion per year. At this rate, it will take over 20 years to complete them all.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally depressing is the state of the major research and development programmes, to the extent that, despite the funds made available in the Union’s budget and the loans granted by the European Investment Bank, public expenditure in this area is actually significantly down on last year, while private investment is still below the minimum required as well. It is therefore time to launch a major initiative to bring about a substantial increase in the funding of both the Trans-European Networks and the major research and development projects. I have therefore asked Philippe Maystadt, the President of the European Investment Bank, to work with me in seeking new sources of funding, exploring all possible options such as Union guarantees and special borrowing facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">These, ladies and gentlemen, are the preconditions for reinvigorating the Lisbon process and expanding the horizons of our knowledge. Joint research, networks of excellence, mobility of students and researchers and the key programmes on life sciences, renewable energy and the environment are vital. I am quite aware that financing is not the only obstacle to the speedy implementation of these major projects, and I am equally aware that many years are needed to complete them. That, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why there is no time to waste.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a word of thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency of the Council, and also, Mr Simitis, to you personally. This time of grave crisis is one in which, rather than dividing Europe, it needs to be brought together, and it is evident that that is what is in your mind. As this Europe of ours does not belong to any one party family alone, but is our common possession, what I desire for you and for us all, gathered here, is that, in the remaining weeks of your Presidency, you will be successful in guiding this European Union in the right direction for the future!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At this time, we think of the coalition troops in Iraq, some 30 000 of them from a Member State of the European Union. Human dignity being indivisible, though, we think also of the Iraqi soldiers who are being misused by a criminal regime. I hope that what was so well expressed in the Conclusions of the summit here in Brussels will indeed come to pass, and that all Iraqis will very soon be allowed to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity under a representative government that will be at peace with its neighbours and an active member of the international community. That must be our objective, and we Europeans must not opt out at this stage but, together, united and with determination, must make our own effective contribution to giving peace in the Middle East a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are differences of opinion in our group, as there were before the war, the great majority of us take the view that there is one thing we should be saying to our American friends. It is that, whilst international institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, and, of course, this integrated European structure, the European Union, may have their faults, because they are manned by human beings, we do agree that they have a vision for the future, and, no matter what the imperfections of these structures of peace, we will not allow anyone to jeopardise these institutions, the basis of whose existence is beyond question!</p>
<p class="contents">Richard Perle has said that both the UN and NATO had lost their contemporary relevance and were meaningless in the twenty-first century. I would like to respond to that by saying that, if we ourselves put a question mark against the North Atlantic Alliance, what are we actually saying to the peoples of central Europe, to the Poles, and to the Slovenes, who have just held their referendum? That is where they are seeking security in the face of threats! That is why we have to give some thought to how to improve these institutions, but we must not question their existence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, need proper trans-Atlantic relations and a trans-Atlantic partnership. Nobody is in any doubt about my position on the Iraq issue, and that is why I tell our American friends that the European Union is also in the American interest. Americans should not see relations with Europe solely in terms of relations between the USA and France, the USA and Great Britain, the USA and Germany, the USA and Greece, the USA and all the others. We will soon be meeting them again in the forum of the World Trade Organisation, where the European Union must – and will – present a united front. Hence my plea to our American friends that they take the European Union seriously. It is our way of strengthening our influence in the world; it is our way of living at peace with one another and maintaining good, well-ordered, relations with the United States of America on the basis of partnership!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission has praised the Belgian initiative on defence policy. I spent ten years as chairman of this Parliament's security and disarmament sub-committee, so I know what I am talking about when I say that I very much support what they are trying to do, but am not sure that having a meeting of the few here in Belgium is the right way to go about it. We were highly critical when the British Prime Minister sent out invitations to dinner at No 10 Downing Street, with some being invited and others not. If that sort of thing catches on even in the Benelux states, then my great fear is that we will end up with new communities forming in the south, in the east, in the west, communities of Social Democrats, communities of Christian Democrats, some of them overlapping. We must make use of the Community institutions and work together in them!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a few comments on the Lisbon process; while I am grateful to the President of the European Council for mentioning this topic, we have for some time regarded as excessively bombastic the statement that we are to become a best economic area in the world. It always reminds us a bit of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1960s, always wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what the result was! The goal is the right one, but what now matters is that the instruments be brought into play, and this is where a number of Member States are not doing what has to be done. I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability. A lot is being said about the Stability Pact's flexibility. Let us just consider what the Euro is worth to us today. Let us imagine what things would be like if it did not exist – how then would our currencies be valued in relation to each other today? It is for that reason that we must defend the common European currency, and we need it to be a stable one.</p>
<p class="contents">What is of pre-eminent importance is globalisation, which is often decried – sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly. Big businesses are able to seek out for themselves a business location where taxes are at their lowest, which small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do. It follows that structural reforms must be of such a nature as to enable small and medium-sized firms to invest, taxes to be cut and jobs to be thereby created. This is where governments must take some action at last!</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to make two comments by way of conclusion. I hope that a statute for European political parties will come about before the end of the Greek Presidency, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge you to ensure that we achieve a result on the issue of the financial package with the prospect of enlargement. We will not accept any curtailment of Parliament's rights as regards the Budget, but nor do we want to delay enlargement; we want to keep to the timetable. We wish you success in your efforts to do this. To the President of the Commission, too, I make the plea that we should now do everything possible to maintain Parliament's rights and prevent discrimination against the candidate countries. For these things we will continue to campaign, and we ask that you put them into practice. Then, success will be ours under the Greek Presidency of the Council, a success that I wish, not only for you, but also for us all, and from the bottom of my heart.</p>

In the light of recent events I fear it may yet be called upon to convene further summits.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I should like to express our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the victims of this war. There must be no more victims. My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately. The United Nations must assume management of the conflict. The latter should never have been taken out of the United Nations framework.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also deeply regret the unilateral decision taken by the President of the United States to leave this framework and start a war. I support Mr Annan. Once again, I must emphasise that the present unilateral action is in breach of the United Nations Charter and of international law. On behalf of my group I should like to further reiterate our complete opposition to the doctrine of pre-emptive attack as an instrument of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat what Mr Cook said in the House of Commons. Multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules afford better protection to our British and European interests than unilateral instruments. From President Carter to the Pope, countless individuals around the world endorse this view. Mr Poettering quoted Mr Perle, a spokesperson for the armaments industry. Mr Perle is a shameless lobbyist. He wrote an article thanking God for the failure of the UN. Given that so many are swearing by some God’s name or taking it in vain, I should like to seize this opportunity of sending out a timely reminder. There is a fallen angel in both the Bible and the Koran. The fallen angels, who were angels of light, are named Lucifer and Iblis respectively. Their fall was caused by pride and unbridled blind arrogance. That is the very situation we are currently faced with.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, no war is a clean war. The doctored images presented to us conceal horror. We are today receiving pictures of that market in Baghdad. You will recall that the European Union evolved from a common market. No doubt you also recall another market, in Sarajevo, and how that was bombed. I hope your consciences are stirred. We are all involved in a conflict which is becoming increasingly horrific. Clearly, large numbers of Iraqis long for a future without Saddam Hussein’s oppressive regime. They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity. Clearly too, they do not wish to have further death and destruction inflicted on them.</p>
<p class="contents">This action was taken unilaterally, outside the framework of the Security Council. It has resulted in disaster, because very often the local population does not perceive the troops as a liberating force. The people are determined to protect what is theirs, to defend their land. Furthermore, this region is beset by many complex problems. It is most unwise to destabilise it further, and this could impact the Middle East process.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have insisted that this crisis and future action must be dealt with within the UN framework. I could not agree more. Indeed, I have said so twice already in this House. I have, however, read today’s newspaper and apparently the management of the port of Umm Qasar has been awarded to a United States company. The latter is offering to subcontract some of the work to European companies. This flies in the face of respect for the UN. Is the European Union to be invited to do subcontract work for the UN? That is not the way forward. I believe we should make our voice heard. We must insist on humanitarian aid being administered in a civilian framework, and furthermore, within the UN framework. Aid must not be administered by any of the powers currently involved.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a final point before I finish and leave the floor to my colleague Mr Goebbels. He will speak on the Spring Council. My point is as follows. We know the President of the United States has already estimated the cost of the war at USD 75 000 million per month. Oil prices and exchange rates are on a roller coaster. President-in-Office of the Council, I very much fear that if this state of affairs continues you will be forced to convene a further summit to assess the European and world economies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, we have to recognise that public opinion is riven by emotion. It is disconcerted and overwhelmingly opposed to this war. I refer to wider public opinion, not just to European public opinion. The public does not understand the urgency of this war or the reasons for it. There is a world-wide movement for peace. I have in mind Saturday’s demonstration. It falls to us to relaunch the multilateral approach to international relations. The dignity and legitimacy of the United Nations must be restored. It will then be in a position to fulfil its role as a government for the world. The European Union failed to act as one and therefore bears a share of the responsibility for this crisis. We must be able to envisage a future in which the Union can construct a foreign and security policy worthy of the name. This is essential if we are to act honourably in the interest of the future of all humankind.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council's important economic reform agenda. It is only natural that, at such a time, economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death. However, given the negative economic impact that the conflict could have on the Union's economy, we must not take our eyes off the ball and let the economic reforms that are needed to revitalise our economy fall further behind. So before turning to the conflict with Iraq, I will say a few words about economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the process of economic reform is running into the sand; with the European Union set to enlarge to 25 countries, we will have to run just to stand still. I should like to cite just three examples.</p>
<p class="contents">First, at 1.9% of GDP, our investment in research and development is well below levels in the USA and Japan, and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1% of GDP on research and development, we will be hard pressed to reach the 3% Lisbon target by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">My second example is taken from the Barcelona Council, where Europe's leaders committed themselves to cutting the percentage of single market laws not yet implemented to less than 1.5% – instead, the proportion rose last year to over 2%. As the incoming Member States will naturally face some teething problems in implementing law in the early years, this implementation deficit is in danger of growing further if we do not redouble our efforts. Progress will certainly not be achieved if others emulate the tactics used by Mr Berlusconi in his shameful attempt to defend illegal milk subsidies at the expense of a deal on the taxation of savings. That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">And third: raising levels of employment. It is impressive that we managed to create half a million jobs last year despite the economic slowdown. But the scale of the task ahead becomes clear when we note that unemployment in the EU as a whole rose last year to nearly 8%. On the issue of jobs, the Council appears to have followed the age-old practice: ‘If in doubt, create a task force’. I wish Wim Kok well in his work, but it is hard to see what answers he can come up with which are better than the tried and trusted recipe of reducing the burden of taxes on labour and increasing market flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iraq, I welcome the forward-looking nature of the European Council conclusions, brokered by the President-in-Office, and their focus on humanitarian assistance, on rebuilding Iraq and the central role to be played in this by the United Nations. Humanitarian aid must get through. We see from the situation in Basra just how important that is. The horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working. I welcome Mr Prodi's proposal for EUR 3 million of immediate humanitarian aid through the Red Cross. Liberal Democrats will support the rapid approval by our House of your request for the release of a further EUR 70 million from the emergency budget reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has been damaged by the divisions of recent weeks. This could presage a new effort to heal the political wounds, but it is hard not to agree with the Luxembourg Prime Minister when he says that problems cannot be resolved unless they are discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Council that we need to strengthen transatlantic relations. Our dialogue must be extended to cover reform of the United Nations and the role of international law, but the United States must accept that nothing durable can be established without institutions and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also welcomes Belgium's proposal for a ministerial meeting on North Korea. If the situation in Iraq had been discussed at the Seville Summit – as Mr Verhofstadt proposed – we might not be at sixes and sevens today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must wait and see whether 2003 is an <span class="italic">annus mirabilis</span> or an <span class="italic">annus horribilis</span> for the European Union, but since we are now in the Year of the Goat, I would congratulate the Greek Presidency on its tenacity, persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brie (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Simitis, the President-in-Office of the Council, quoted the statement from the summit to the effect that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained. I do believe though – and hence my dissatisfaction – that you ought also to have mentioned that this territorial integrity is at this very moment under the most massive attack and that our most important task is to end this war. It is my belief that we can see, from day to day, how it is becoming more evident that this war is becoming ever more inhuman and more contrary to international law. For Mr Rumsfeld, the American Secretary for Defence, to describe it – as he did yesterday – as a humanitarian act, is something I can regard only as cynicism of a fairly barbarous kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that when the USA started the war a week ago, it mounted an assault on the most important principle of law for civilised nations, that being the obligation to resolve conflicts by peaceful means. This is a tragedy, particularly because this was not merely an instance of obligations and international law being violated, but also because it wrecked a great and outstanding opportunity for effective peacemaking. I believe that any common foreign policy on the part of the European Union – something that has again been referred to today – must be not merely common, but also an alternative, countering the USA's unilateralism, military power politics, and disregard for law and treaties with a strengthened United Nations, with the defence of the UN Charter, of international law and of the international ban on the use of force. Any such policy must deal with conflicts – not only the specific conflicts themselves, but also their causes – and promote cooperation across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like right now – and without repeating too much – to draw your attention to three primary problems. For a start, my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end. Even though the numbers of the civilians and soldiers wounded or killed by bombs and other military measures are bad enough, neither the statements by the Council, nor the statements to the press, nor the statistics make any reference to the thousands of Iraqi children who are dying even now as a consequence of this war.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is no doubt that this war puts the USA in breach of international law. It is even now openly threatening to break international law again. Last week, and quite openly, Mr Rumsfeld, the Secretary for Defence, ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with CS gas. You are well aware, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that there is no exception to the ban on the use in armed conflict even of non-lethal gases such as CS gas, contained both in the Geneva Protocol and in Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I call upon you to object to the US administration's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties, and to do so in unmistakeable terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in Iraq there are tens of thousands of Iranians opposed to the regime in their own country, as well as Kurdish refugees from Turkey. Lingering in refugee camps, their fate attracts no international attention. They are very much at risk from this war and the threat of massacre hangs over them. I beg you to ensure that their plight becomes public knowledge, and to tell your Iranian, Turkish, American and British partners that the European Union will keep a close eye on what becomes of these people. Above all, Mr Simitis, have the courage to demand that the USA put an end to this war!</p>

To my surprise, I was faced with a banner reminiscent of demonstrations my contemporaries and I were involved in, back in the mists of time. Emblazoned on this banner was a text to the effect that making war to preserve peace is like making love to preserve your virginity. I have not quoted the exact English version so as to preserve some elegance. I am sure none of you will have difficulty understanding it.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you are quite right when you say this war is an intellectual challenge. I would add that it is also a physical one. Plainly, we are allowing our divisions to stunt our intellectual faculties. It is also plain that a number of Council declarations have a surreal quality. So too have statements made by Members of this House. Plainly too, we are all in favour of humanitarian aid. That is the one point on which there is general consensus, and on this I agree with Mr Watson. That much is clear. The issue we are confronted with today is quite straightforward, however. Will Parliament make a clear statement on this war or will it not? Will Parliament be tarred with the same brush as the Council of Ministers or the General Affairs Council or will we achieve a majority tomorrow? I appeal to those who do not want a majority at any price. I urge them to stop and think.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice is between two clearly defined positions. One is the stance taken by the coalition of those in favour of the war because they believe it is important and necessary, as has just been stated. They can go ahead and vote for a resolution that might read as follows. Carry on the good work Mr Rumsfeld, or any other like-minded person. Right is on your side. Off you go, in the name of God, liberate the planet and show how to make love without losing one’s virginity. They have every right to do so. The second position involves obtaining a majority in this House to reject war as an option. Such a majority was achieved at the end of January when the war was declared illegal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Accommodation will be called for in order to obtain a majority against the war. If we are unable to make compromises we shall show ourselves to be as intellectually stunted as the Brussels Council. That is the problem confronting us today. It is actually quite easy to solve. Some state that the war was not sanctioned by the United Nations. Others state it is neither legal nor legitimate. I maintain it all comes to the same thing, and that only honourable Members skilled in hair-splitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases. Obviously, having established that the war does not have the backing of the United Nations, it can be said to lack legitimacy. Consequently if this motion is passed, we will have notched up a victory. That much is plain.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the text of the resolution, a heated debate is in progress over the form of words. It concerns whether to express deep regret or condemnation of the fact that the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Italy, Poland and several other states I cannot recall should have unilaterally decided war was justified and gone ahead. In my view, what needs to be made plain in this resolution is that inspections should have been continued and that we are opposed to those who put an end to them and resorted to war. I do not therefore believe it is a matter of vocabulary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one further point quite clear before I conclude. Some Heads of Government are intent on keeping certain lies alive. The reason why the Security Council did not vote for the resolution tabled by the United States, United Kingdom and Spain was not a French or Russian veto. The reason was that there was no moral majority in the Security Council in favour of going to war. That is the plain truth!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On this basis Chile and Mexico had the courage to table a resolution which rightly retained inspections as the way forward. It should be borne in mind that both these countries are economically dependent on the United States. The House must therefore understand that when it votes tomorrow, it will also be sending out a message on that carefully nurtured lie perpetuated by the UK and Spanish Foreign Ministers and several others. The moral majority that emerged on the Security Council in favour of intervention in Kosovo was 13 to 2. No such majority emerged in favour of intervention in Iraq. That is a historical fact. The rest is simply a brazen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people. One must call a spade a spade.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say how much I hope the House will have the good sense to vote tomorrow in such a way as to make it plain that the advocates of war have been overcome and relegated to the minority. If we win, we will have won a greater battle than a mere battle of words. Each group will then be able to resort to its ideology to defend the common view. If we are prepared to make compromises I am confident we can win this moral victory over the advocates of war tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, we cannot deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light. Consensus building – which is at the centre of policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency – could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints on the war in Iraq taken by different countries in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government tried valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe, but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts, this objective could not be secured. The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In very simple and blunt terms, we are here today to try and pick up the pieces after what has been a bruising experience for all Member States within the European Union. We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of adversity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the core of the challenges we now face. The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years. We must not, and cannot, lose sight of this fact, but we must look at the bigger picture. The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe. We have an internal market, we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe. We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of the last few weeks have rocked the European Union to its foundation. We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and play a central role in providing all the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq over the coming months. I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship. America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together, as opposed to working against the interests of one another. We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination. We must continue to work with the United Nations, whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many others here today, I greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq. The atmosphere here today is muted, but that must not disguise the fact that the European Union does have a lead role to play in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people will be fully addressed. This is our duty, a duty which, last week, the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to. I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as the Greek Presidency indicated, these summits represent the high point of hypocrisy. The peak of absurdity in this chronicle of a break up foretold, is that for once, Europe did say the same thing, even if it did not speak with a single voice. I refer to the Europe of the institutions. All the institutions came out in favour of the same approach. The European Parliament declared itself on 31 January, the European Council on 17 February, followed by the Commission through the words of Mr Patten and your own words, Mr Prodi. They all declared themselves in favour of the approach put forward by France, Germany and Belgium. It involved giving precedence to the law enshrined in the United Nations Security Council. For once too, the Europe of the institutions was at one with the people of Europe. The people of Europe also gave overwhelming indeed unanimous support to this same approach. We may actually be witnessing the birth of a new form of European political public opinion transcending national boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe certainly did speak with a single voice. Even better, Europe spoke with the same voice. So what? Mr Prodi, vacuous statements are being attributed to Mussolini. He might well have said that when it came down to it, governing Italy was not as difficult. The difficulty lay in that it served no purpose. In the light of current developments, it seems to me that Europe is in danger of becoming an Italy raised to the power of 15 and later of 25.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty is not quite as Mr Simitis described it. It is far more complex. This is not some kind of agricultural marathon, where one has to adjudicate between carrots and turnips. Mr Simitis, your comments were unworthy of your position. For the first time since the Treaty of Rome, Europe finds itself divided on objectives rather than on methods, means or timetables. One half of Europe has become the adversary of the other. That is the crux of the issue. We are up against two opposing concepts of law, two opposing visions of the world, two opposing cosmogonies. That last word comes from Greek, Mr Simitis. In this very House, you have seen banners emblazoned with <span class="italic">Stop the killers</span>, and others with <span class="italic">Give a chance to war</span>. Do you really believe this is like dealing with carrots and turnips when no decision has yet been taken on the film’s ending? Mr Simitis, eurospeak is no different from other meaningless political speak.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you referred to a European defence system. There has been much talk of one. Why not? Europe’s last chance could indeed be to create a genuinely European defence system. I have to tell you here and now, however, that this debate will take place in other fora, including the level of the Convention. The European defence system will not be created within NATO any more than the single currency was created in Fort Knox. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why not say ethical, Dany? Tomorrow, our task will be not to seek a humble, secular political majority on specific objectives, but rather to build a moral majority in this House. Go and get yourselves killed with your ethics, with your morals, with your quests for absolutes, with your digressions! Our secular – or Christian if you prefer – task is to find for us all, tomorrow, as we are doing in Italy by identifying one or two feasible political objectives for the future, a path which will make it possible, instead of staying in your 1938 Munich world, Dany, to go to a world where, at the weekend, we will all fight together for free Italians, free Germans or free Iraqis, instead of sacrificing everything to the moloch of peace, to the moloch of an absolute whose boundaries you are totally unable to define. Of course we want peace, but not the ‘rest in peace’ kind! And death does not start with American or Israeli missiles or guns; death starts with all the victims of Pol Pot, with all those whom you do not even remember, with the peoples of the Volga and Don rivers deported 80 years ago, with the 500 thousand killed and massacred by Saddam in the last 10 years. All your moralising, all your absolutes! I accept, I am pleased that some Communists are turning and are changing from Communists to Liberals, but I do not accept that they should expect to continue to condemn me, as they did as Communists, accusing me of not being liberal enough or non-violent enough. Me!</p>
<p class="contents">I would propose an amendment to your motion, Mr President, an amendment which, at this time in Italy – and I would also point this out to the President-in-Office of the Council so that he considers it – has obtained an absolute majority of Italian MPs: a simple proposal, that is, to make the goal of a free Iraq the subject of negotiations, even with Saddam, negotiations possible here and now, as President Mubarak, Tony Blair and others, secularly and with humility and courage, say they want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this hope was dashed by the so-called new strategic dogma, and global public opinion is witnessing a military conflict which, over and above its uniformed and civilian casualties, to all of whom we pay our respects, has inflicted collateral damage on basic institutions and parameters of international life such as the UN, the guardian of the fundamental prerogatives of the international system of law, transatlantic relations, which are indispensable to international equilibrium and, finally, the cohesion of the European Union, at least in the foreign policy sector, which is vital if it is to have a decisive presence on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">All these institutional factors have been seriously damaged and are being severely tested, in such a way that their future, or at least their ability to play their particular role in international events efficiently, still hangs in the balance; they have to face up to a great many unpleasant truths both now and in the long term, the most important of which, of course, is the fact that the authority and the very essence of the UN have been undermined and those who favour unilateralism and high-handedness over logic and legality when acting to resolve what are doubtless very real problems have left its principles and rules in tatters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no use confining ourselves to a diagnosis of the current tragic situation and a prognosis of its inauspicious prospects, however. On the contrary, we need to turn our attention to the future and support the overwhelming majority of nations and governments by trying, even before the war ends – which we all hope will be sooner rather than later – to restore the prestige of the United Nations, which will undertake to restore normal conditions in Iraq, strengthen the transatlantic relationship within a framework of cooperation and on an absolutely equal footing and consolidate European unity, so that the sad events we have witnessed over the last few days never act as a future precedent and are consigned to history as an example to be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was clear beforehand that the summit would be divided on Iraq and stalemate would ensue. We were resigned to the Union being confirmed in its role as a political dwarf. To have the so-called economic giant settle for the lowest common denominator in its economic, social and environmental conclusions is, however, cause for despair. The world is threatened by a serious recession that will probably last longer than previously anticipated due to the war in Iraq. Yet we are treated to empty words.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is not to blame. Nonetheless, it has seen fit to present us with 37 pages of conclusions, containing 12 640 words. I would remind you that Moses managed to write the Ten Commandments in a mere 180 words. The summit must have had one sane moment though. Paragraph 9 of the conclusions reads as follows. ‘Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do. It is time (...) for the Union and the Member States to fulfil their commitments regarding (...) by translating words into action.’</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to action, the European Council invited the Commission to consider several problems. Between now and the 2004 spring summit the people of Europe can expect at least 17 new action plans, road maps and other reports. Jumbled up in this Community rag bag are a new employment task force, the stated wish for more concise guidelines on economic policy and for recommendations on economic reforms with strict timetables if appropriate. The Commission was invited to produce a report on tightening up the use of structural indicators. There is to be a plan of action on entrepreneurship and another on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework. Instead of a framework directive on public services, agreed on first at Nice and again at Barcelona, we are to have a Green Paper on the subject. The must-have list even includes a study on the means the European Union could deploy to assist the people of Iraq to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the Van Miert report on missing links in trans-European networks following enlargement, the so-called Competitiveness Council was invited to specify the guidelines required in terms of connectivity. No connectivity means fewer exchanges and less growth. Nonetheless, the Council failed to take any decisions to remedy the obvious shortcomings of the infrastructure of an enlarged Europe. In these times of severe budgetary restrictions, the states are happy to deceive themselves that the top of a molehill is a lofty summit with a view far into the distance. As long as the Union is forced to manage on 1% of the Community GDP, it will be reduced to making empty gestures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering is concerned for the euro. I have to say that our single currency is holding up pretty well against the dollar and other international currencies, despite the French and German deficits. If monetary stability really has to be preserved for the public good, then exceptional situations call for courageous measures. The cost of the war and the subsequent cost of the peace will be a heavy burden for the economy of the world. A policy to revive the economy is vital if Europe is to avoid deep recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wonder why the Commission is delaying application of the flexibility provided by the Amsterdam Council’s resolution for times of recession. I wonder too what it is waiting for to encourage investment pursuant to Rule 11 of the Council Regulations dated that very 7 July 1997. I trust it will not wait for an official statement that our economies are in difficulty before taking action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I join with him in condemning the conflict in Iraq and calling for agreements within the framework of the United Nations, of course. I also join with him in wishing to commit the European Union to regaining its unity. The Union must then contribute to rebuilding the affected areas so a process of peace and stability can actually be consolidated and guaranteed. The European Union was unable to demonstrate the unity required. Sadly, it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped. I trust that at least we shall now be capable of first regaining our unity and then of leading the peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results of the Brussels Council held last week. The Council was devoted in particular to consideration of the so-called Lisbon process. During debates and discussion at Strasbourg it had already emerged that we have little to congratulate ourselves on in this regard. In terms of productivity and competitiveness, the gap between Europe and the United States has not narrowed. On the contrary, it is now actually widening.</p>
<p class="contents">As we understand it, the reason is that the appropriate structural reforms were not carried out. Also, the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise. New enterprises capable of taking on board innovation and new technological processes were not encouraged either. Obviously, all this has hampered the development hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the secret of effective implementation of the Lisbon process commitments lies in the area of structural reform. It is equally important to promote research and development activities and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, in conjunction with proposals for social improvements.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, at this Spring Summit the Council needed to show itself capable of reversing its neoliberal political guidelines and to adopt a policy that gives priority to employment, public investment, inclusion and economic and social cohesion, in order to address the economic slowdown, unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which remain at high levels in the European Union. Unfortunately, it did not do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of halting the process of liberalising essential public sectors and services, it has followed the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe (UNICE) and insists on accelerating economic reforms based mainly on speeding up the process of liberalisation in sectors and services, on the competitiveness of undertakings, on stepping up the coordination of budgetary policies and on the strategy of the Single Market, continually relegating the social sphere to second place, subordinating the objectives of the labour market, education and society to the entrepreneurial spirit, and insisting on the rapid inclusion of pensions in the financial services action plan, opening the way to their privatisation. In this way, it waters down principles laid down in the Treaty and impedes their implementation, specifically in the fields of economic and social cohesion, solidarity, environmental protection, public health and food safety, public services and social rights, sustainable development and the quality of life, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of suspending the Stability Pact in order to review the irrational criteria for nominal convergence and committing to a policy of economic development that is capable of addressing international uncertainty and instability, which has been made worse by the unjust, illegitimate and illegal war against Iraq, the Council is reaffirming the need for these objectives to be met. It is thereby sweeping under the carpet the serious difficulties facing some Member States and the serious social and economic consequences caused by the obsession with cutting investment and public spending, preventing objectives for creating high-quality jobs from being attained and increasing social tensions and labour instability. Even when the Council acknowledges the need to present a declaration on services of general interest, it postpones drawing up such a document until the next Competition Council, thereby forcing these services to obey the rules of competition, which is not acceptable because this heightens social inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of implementing urgent measures, as Parliament called for during the last part-session in Strasbourg, to address the increase in restructuring, relocations and closures by European and multinational companies, which are making thousands of workers redundant and which call into question the regional development of huge areas in crisis where there are few alternatives forms of employment, the Council has opted to attach absolute priority to companies’ competitiveness, insisting on structural reforms of the labour market, on worker mobility and on making labour more flexible and precarious in order to adapt to the current economic climate. Hence the question remains as to the rationale for creating the working group on employment: I would like the Council to explain whether this has been done to allay the concern in the minds of those people who still retain a modicum of sensitivity to the problems of millions of unemployed or whether the intention is simply to shape the implementation of the European employment strategy in order to facilitate the implementation of its increasingly neoliberal guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the Spring Council was clear at the outset: it was to be an economic forum, an opportunity to review the stage we had reached and also to chart out a new way for the future, in particular by looking again at the Lisbon strategy and establishing what alterations had to be made for us to continue to move towards that target. It should also be an opportunity to focus on continuing the development of economic growth and employment and also guaranteeing quality of life, quality jobs and pension entitlements for all people across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, economic uncertainties and global political risks confront us and make alterations difficult. We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied, to a certain extent, to the kind of things that we can achieve. However, there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives. To create and sustain jobs, the European Union must become the most competitive economic area in the world and I am delighted to welcome the Council's decision to establish the Competitiveness Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus. Areas of literacy, digital developments, vocational training and lifelong learning must be seen as key parts of the package to give the people of Europe the necessary tools to be able to meet with the demands of an ever-changing economic environment. We must be enterprise-friendly. We must be more flexibility-friendly, not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union, sending it to low-cost labour areas. We must also ensure that the Commission is held to task with regard to the impact assessment it carries out on proposing legislation and the effect it will have on an industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage. However, not just any kind of employment will achieve that. It is the quality of jobs and the quality of entitlements that will make it happen. Social partnership has proven itself as a model with regard to how we can overcome difficulties in the workplace, ensuring proper representation for workers and also guaranteeing that enterprises have the freedom and flexibility to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other points that I want to make very briefly. First of all, one of the key elements must be protection of our environment. We must ensure that when we hand down our countries and our continent to future generations, they are in a better condition than they were in when we inherited them.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq. Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq, the most important thing to do now – and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this – is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid, facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unfortunate proposals that were publicised on the margins of the Council of Europe simply in order to keep tagging along with a small group of sympathisers made the discord even worse. In these circumstances in particular, it was surprising and positive that the Member States were actually able to issue a joint, forward-looking declaration on Iraq in which the European Union also exhibits a sense of responsibility by promising both humanitarian aid and implicit help in reconstructing the country. I compliment the Greek Presidency, which was able to sneak that in by concentrating on what was politically achievable. I call on the Commission to put forward concrete proposals for both kinds of aid as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration on the territorial integrity of Mesopotamia is of particular importance, as this is currently threatened by Turkey’s plans to enter Iraq. What means does the Council plan to use to prevent Turkey from doing this? I fear that political pressure alone will not be enough. Is the Council also willing to impose far-reaching political or economic sanctions against Turkey if the Turks actually cross the Iraqi border? I for my part think these should include postponing or abandoning her accession to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the declaration shows great appreciation of the United Nations. I would, however, like to emphasise that this organisation cannot operate unless <span class="italic">all</span>, and I repeat <span class="italic">all</span> members (particularly of the Security Council) take responsibility for the actual enforcement of the international rule of law and the continuity of UN resolutions. Inflexibility and an unwillingness to compromise are really not the sole preserve of the Americans. In the light of the events of the past few weeks, I therefore find Europe’s devotion to the UN painfully hollow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was almost surreal. The crucial issue of the war was relegated to the additional points which confirms, if confirmation were needed, that the European Union is not a player in international diplomacy in its own right. Further to the conclusions devoted to Iraq it seems rather to be cast as a humanitarian NGO. As for the glorification of the CFSP in conclusion 69, this is clearly what surrealist writers term automatic writing.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to whether it really is in Europe’s interest to resort to language of this kind to play down the current split. Ever since the question of Iraq arose, our continent has become a virtual battlefield. The battle is between two visions of Europe’s rightful role in the world and also about the very organisation of the international system. Europe is currently at the heart of a fundamental debate with implications for the future of the whole international community. There is discussion on whether Europe should be independent or aligned, whether there should be unilateralism or agreement between nations. The European Union itself is not participating in the debate, but Europe is certainly involved. Along with the United States, Europe is one of the main interlocutors in the form of two troikas. On the one hand there is Paris-Berlin-Moscow, and on the other London-Madrid-Rome. Each of these troikas has its rationale and support. For one this is enshrined in the New York memorandum, and for the other in the Declaration of the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">I query whether the only way of dealing with these two views is to deplore them. To do so is to confirm a monolithic vision of Europe, whereas diversity has always been our distinguishing feature. We would deserve the derogatory appellation of old Europe if we indicated we no longer wished to be the privileged area where different conceptions of world order wrestle with each other. We would certainly deserve it if we were only intent on evading the impact of confrontation, for the sole benefit of spineless and meaningless consensus. Robert Kagan might be proved right. No matter if what Europe says has no impact, so long as Europe says it with one voice. Is that really our aim? Should it be necessary to stifle all differences of opinion to be a true European? Could not the spirit of free competition be applied also to foreign policy? I would say to the Presidents that the European Union would be failing the people of Europe if, in the interests of uniformity, it made Europe distance itself from mayor debates on the future of the world instead of taking its place at the heart of those debates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not mention the situation in Iraq because my group chairman has already done so and my fellow countryman and colleague Arie Oostlander will be doing so. I will therefore concentrate on the socio-economic aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the uncertainty about the consequences of the war and its duration will have and is having an impact on the world economy. I think, however, that we must also realise that the growth in unemployment in Europe naturally started long before that. One of the reasons for this is, of course, the lack of structural reforms in the European economy and the fact that necessary measures have been postponed for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I was nevertheless enormously shocked when I saw the scoreboard which the European Commission – and bravo for doing so – has for the first time added to the documents that contained an evaluation relating to Lisbon. If you allow that to sink in, you realise that there is an enormous gap between the words and decisions being taken on the one hand and their implementation on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Spring Summit should have given at least as much priority to restoring confidence in the European economy, in terms of what is agreed at policy level. I must say that the Spring Summit delivered more than I had anticipated. So in this spirit, I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">What really matters now, however, is its implementation, and that is why my group – and I am pleased to see that this has also been adopted by other groups – has proposed compiling a roadmap in which the European Commission sets out in more detail what steps need to be taken in order to achieve the Lisbon targets by 2010. I therefore hope that the Commission – and I am also looking at the President, Mr Prodi – will be able to produce such a roadmap by October 2003, so that we can get a more accurate idea of what must happen in the future. That is all the more necessary on account of our impending enlargement and because the Lisbon targets will, of course, soon have to be achieved in a much bigger European Union, and I think that it would be useful to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises have a significant role to play in the area of employment. We now need to actually implement the charter we established for SMEs, for example, but also the action plan for the simplification of regulation. We have been talking about the need to make it easier for SMEs to access investment capital for so long now. Why do we not do it, why can we not just get rid of these obstructions?</p>
<p class="contents">We have formulated a fine target of 3% of the GNP for research and development, public and private, by 2010, and rightly so, but we need to finalise this too, as some Member States will already be above 4-5% by then and others will still be a long way off. How are we going to close this gap, and what efforts will have to be made by the various Member States? We are in favour of the open coordination method, but that is not enough, and the European Parliament and the national parliaments will also have to be involved in this.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may be permitted to summarise, I would like to say that we are on the right track, but it would in particular be to the Commission’s credit if we could convert our good intentions into <span class="italic">roadmaps</span> in order to create concrete handholds that enable us to evaluate where we stand and evaluate our progress together every year and in order to prevent the Member States from hiding behind fine words. It is now time for deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The state of war which surrounds us at present and which has been imposed on us not by the Americans, not by the American nation or the American people, but by the Bush administration, with its unilateral and arrogant policy, and by a number of European governments which took it upon themselves to split the European Union, is in danger of distracting us from our set programme.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, keeping our eye firmly on the long-term programme of the European Union is not a formalistic policy, it is a way of maintaining and starting to restore the seriously damaged union of Europe. When you want unity, you do not start, nor should you start with what divides you; you start with what unites you. And however much our foreign policy divides us at the moment, our economic policy is equally well able to unite us.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to achieve this truly admirable and ambitious objective, we must make the macro-economy work more efficiently, integrate the financial services market in Europe and strengthen the spirit of enterprise, research, education and the integration of the European networks. But how can we integrate the European networks when, as the President of the Commission pointed out, we only spend EUR 20 billion a year and it will take twenty years to complete the programme?</p>
<p class="contents">All these worthy objectives are included in the Lisbon strategy; however, we have to admit that we are in the third year and, in certain sectors such as education, for example, things are not going quite according to plan. Those who supported the Lisbon strategy for regenerating the European economy were right about one thing. Their programme, with the resources which needed to be mobilised, was a programme with a long-term return. However, we need measures which have an immediate return in the present climate, with the threat of recession hanging over the global economy, so that we can find new impetus which will allow the Lisbon strategy to proceed to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this to happen, we need to shake off the fatal spirit of defeatism besieging us at present and regain the spirit of determination of Lisbon, even if the present, disastrous circumstances for the Union can be summed up in the words of Kipling: ‘If you can bear to see your life's work broken and stoop again, build it again with worn-out tools’. That is precisely where we stand at the moment. That is where our duty lies. If we fight for this, the day will dawn when truth will also prevail for us in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the war is under way, however, and we must look to the future. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party hopes that the war will be short, that there will be as few civilian casualties as possible, that Turkey will not enter Kurdistan and that we shall soon be able to bring the Iraqi dictator to justice in The Hague. Those who were carrying placards here in the Chamber, bearing the words ‘Stop the killing!’ should call to mind how many hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered and driven out of the country by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">The post-war period will see some arduous work begin, first of all of course in the form of humanitarian aid. Following that, Iraq must be reconstructed. Stable and democratic institutions must be created so that the Iraqi people can at last live in freedom and peace. The UN must have ultimate responsibility for this work, and the EU must make a generous contribution. Iraq must not become an American protectorate.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, new life must be breathed into the peace process in the Middle East. Transatlantic relations, which are in tatters, must be repaired. The UN needs to be reformed, and we must get a broad discussion under way about what international law really entails and about how it might be able to protect people in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the EU must get its act together and show that it has learned from the <span class="italic">débâcle</span> of recent weeks. We need a common foreign policy. We can make a host of institutional changes but, as long as there is a lack of political will, the EU will fail to be heard in the arena of foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A paradox? No. We can expect even this from the fundamentalist culture of Bush’s council. I have seen an Iraqi baby’s lacerated head, lacerated by the weapons of those who call themselves liberators. Those bodies and images are no different from those of the Kurdish baby girl poisoned by Saddam’s chemical weapons, the little Palestinian boy slaughtered by the Israeli army, the little Israeli girl killed by a suicide bomber or the bodies of the Twin Towers victims.</p>
<p class="contents">With this war, the masks have come off. The USA is not complying with international law: consider Kyoto, the International Criminal Court, the death penalty, star wars, the use of weapons of mass destruction. United States militarism is a danger to the international community; a policy of domination and death is a <span class="italic">danse macabre</span> between terrorism and this policy. However, it is also from the United States, from its people, that hope and an alternative are emerging: huge groups are saying ‘no’ to the war, ‘no’ to terrorism, ‘no’ to revenge, as they are all over the world. What can and should we do? How can we make the countries waging this war of aggression comply with the agreement ratified in the United Nations after the Second World War? Europe cannot simply say: we will take care of the reconstruction. Our efforts should be channelled into stopping an unlawful war. The present, Mr Simitis, is the past and also the future. This is why we must prevent Iraqi, British and American citizens dying. We say that the UN should be the organisation to act: and so let us convene the Security Council and the United Nations Assembly. Europe must be united, of course, but it must be united in saying ‘no’ and in ending this war. Rabiya, a young Iraqi girl, told me with great intensity: ‘You are killing our dreams too; you are killing our dream that we can free ourselves from Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship’.</p>

The war against Iraq is completely without justification and must therefore be condemned. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is something on which the Council remains silent. In the war against Iraq, cluster bombs and landmines are to be used, in contravention of international law. The Council remains silent about that, Mr President. The war is being waged against the civilian population, millions of innocent people becoming immediate or secondary victims, the latter as a result of the collapse of food and water supplies. Anyone who has been in Iraq will know what the situation there is like. The war is unleashing a humanitarian catastrophe, but the Council has nothing to say about that either, and so, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I call upon you to be silent no longer. I urge you to support the initiative by Russia and the Arab League for an emergency session of the Security Council, to gather together those Member States of the European Union that have opposed the war, and to set in motion action that will rescue the United Nations from its role of spectator and again give it a part to play in this conflict.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gollnisch (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the 1815 Congress was criticised for amusing itself while there was a war on. One could take a cue from history and lay the same charge against the members of the Council. In the shameful summary document issued, the word Iraq first appears only on page 31 of the 36 pages of the Presidency conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your distressing verbal statement proved the Union’s failure and powerlessness. The war is happening. It is an event of major significance. With Great Britain at their head, the Union’s members are directly responsible for it. Yet you say we can do nothing about it and we should change the subject. There is actually a lot to be said, now that the lies used by the British-American Empire to justify its brutal aggression have been revealed as what they are. It claimed the war was about enabling the UN to disarm Iraq. That was a lie. The war had in fact been planned from the outset, regardless of any developments. This has now been revealed. You ventured to say the Security Council was stalled because it had not voted a resolution authorising the war. That was a lie. The Security Council was not stalled. It had adopted a procedure that was working.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq was supposed to be weakened. It had been systematically starved for ten years, and forced to disarm in exchange for promises of peace. It was meant to collapse during the first few hours of battle. That proved to be another lie. Iraq is offering strong, often heroic resistance. The people of Iraq were going to greet the troops of the British-American empire as a liberating army. That too was a lie. The people perceive the troops as an army of occupation. Iraq was said to possess weapons of mass destruction. The whole spectrum of falsehoods on this subject has been aired, from the most sinister to the most ridiculous. I have in mind Tony Blair’s statement on 5 February. He brought shame upon himself when he presented a report justifying aggression. Eleven of the 19 pages of the document were based on a student diary dating back some ten years. To date, the only weapons of mass destruction recorded are the millions of sophisticated bombs and missiles the Anglo-Saxon empire is using to wipe out Iraqi towns.</p>
<p class="contents">As a lawyer, I have noted the cynical violation of all the legal provisions the British and Americans themselves put in place to prevent war. As a European, I regret the hatred of the Western world resulting from the use of the empire’s bombs. Sadly it is justified. As a Christian, I am aghast that a blatantly unjust war should be waged in the name of God. I believe in calling a spade a spade. Tony Blair is merely an urbane murderer. As for George Bush, he should stop appealing to God, unless it is to beg Him to keep the blood of innocent Iraqis from staining the hands of the American people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since its defeat in the first Gulf War, Iraq has been the object of many resolutions, with which it has generally not complied. This has never, however, resulted in their being enforced under the auspices of the UN. For a long time there were even attempts to have the sanctions against Iraq lifted. There was also barely any international reaction at all when the inspections were cut short on account of Iraq’s failure to cooperate. Yet Saddam Hussein’s obsession with the production of weapons of mass destruction was well-known. Since then, his people have been oppressed and refugees have been and still are coming to our EU Member States. Iraq remained a festering sore. There is no sign of peace there. Because of the secret service, however, there is apparently great stability, which cannot, unfortunately, be attacked from within – I see no sign of it being so. Our patience with this can run out too quickly, indeed, but patience can also degenerate into indifference. For many years this was apparent in our attitude towards the dramatic events in Yugoslavia. Who is not still embarrassed by that? We now know that anyone who wants to establish justice must in extreme cases accept the support of force, including military force.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there, however, sufficient formal basis under international law for the coalition’s military presence? I quote Max van der Stoel, a well-known Socialist ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, High Commissioner for minorities at the OECD, a well-known, important Socialist spokesman. Yesterday he said the following in the <span class="italic">NRC-Handelsblad:</span> ‘Yes, this basis is not convincing, but I do not doubt the coalition’s moral justification of this action for a moment, I do not doubt it for a moment.’ I find that a good left-wing stance.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate at the time was about whether intervention should take place immediately, after one or two weeks or after six weeks. This debate is not sufficient to drum a clear message into the minds of those who risk their lives in the field. There is little point in their looking back. The question is whether we should now wish the coalition forces a swift victory so as to avoid long-drawn-out misery both for the public and for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to make it clear that when push comes to shove, they all really support the armies, in the same way as they support the people who need to be liberated as quickly as possible. I cannot imagine that any of us would not support the armies now. We are not very quick to demonstrate on this side of the Chamber, but I was surprised to see large pieces of paper with the word ‘Peace’ written on them hung up on the other side, while no one ever stopped to wonder what discontent there was in Iraq, and I do not remember seeing any demonstrations against that, not even in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is important that justice takes its course for Saddam Hussein. It is a matter of regret that the UN Security Council has forfeited authority. Vetoes are being used in a dishonest way, and votes are up for sale. The UN per se and its services will be more important than ever in post-war Iraq. We must realise that this matter is a serious warning to the EU, which is obviously still not capable of or willing to defend European principles and values wherever it is necessary to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not think much of the placards behind me either, but – particularly as their group has fewer placards on display – he should have a word with his colleague Mr Helmer, who held up a placard bearing the word ‘Blitzkrieg’. Now, anyone can use placards to express his intellectual stance, and Mr Helmer has done so today, seeming to be the intellectual heir of the people who once held such placards aloft.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Oostlander, if you quote Max van der Stoel and say that the basis may not be convincing, but that, in moral terms, the action is justified, you can also try putting it the other way round and saying that an action is justified only if it is taken on a truly convincing basis. If there is even a whisper of doubt, you are assuming responsibility for endangering human lives. War must always be the last resort of politics, but it cannot be the last resort as long as the policy is a matter of doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">If ever there were an avoidable war, this one is it. A few days ago, ladies and gentlemen, we were presented with the option of coming to a decision on the basis of reports from two respectable diplomats, Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei. They said, or rather Mr ElBaradei said, that there were no nuclear weapons, and that they had found none, and Mr Blix said that his mission had been successful and that we could, given a couple more months, disarm Iraq peacefully. The two gentlemen who made these proposals were not radical socialists, nor were they anti-American agitators; on the contrary, they are thoroughly respectable diplomats from the United Nations, and were showing us a peaceful way ahead, for which there was a majority in the Security Council. There was, though, also a minority, to which the Pope could have given his apostolic blessing, had they nonetheless voted for this war because they had forged a coalition – not of the willing, but of the wilful – which wanted this war to happen come what may.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not impugning the many Members here in this House who believe, on the basis of profound inner conviction, that this tinpot dictator can be got rid of only by the use of armed force. That is one way of looking at things, but not in the least does it alter the fact that these two gentlemen I have quoted showed us a peaceful way forward, and I have heard all those in this House – including those in your group, Mr Poettering – who have said that this was the right way to go. If this was the right way to go, why do you not summon up the courage to say that the war is the wrong way? That, after all, would be the logical conclusion to come to.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say again that those who defy all reason by going down this road also bear the responsibility for the bloody consequences along the way – consequences about which we will all be talking for a long time yet, because we will all be suffering from them.</p>

I would also like to thank everyone who mentioned the Greek Presidency. I shall try and reply briefly to two or three questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you appealed directly to the Greek Presidency to take the initiative and state a specific opinion or take specific recourse to the United Nations. But what is the presidency's role? The role of the presidency, not just the Greek Presidency, but any presidency, is not to decide what the European Union's position is. It is not to welcome one opinion and condemn another. It is not to express its own views, because Greece too has its own views but it cannot express its views as the views of the Union. The role of the presidency is to try and marry differing opinions and to follow the rules in order to bring about a result in the form of a unanimous or majority opinion. If it cannot manage to do that, then it has no place. The role of the presidency therefore, and I should like to emphasise this, is to defend an important virtue, the virtue of cooperation, the virtue of joint endeavour and joint action. That is the first thing it has to do. And that is what the Presidency is working at, because otherwise it will end up with precisely the opposite of what it is supposed to achieve: division. And we do not want division, especially in these difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that a number of honourable Members referred to the Union's foreign policy, again saying that it is non-existent and that nothing has been done. We heard the President of the Commission say that a European Union peacekeeping force will most probably take over the role of the NATO force in Skopje this week. This is unprecedented and is the outcome of serious effort in the foreign policy sector. Anyone listening to the heads of the Balkan countries over the last fortnight, following the assassination of the Serbian prime minister, will have realised that the Western Balkans have high hopes of the European Union. Why? Because the European Union has applied a foreign policy. There are several other examples of the really creative presence of the European Union I could mention. Are there only a few? Yes! There are only a few. And we failed to unite our position on the basic, moral issue of war or peace. We have failed to do so on numerous other issues. But we do not write off what we have done and nor does this mean we must write off what has happened and stop making an effort when it comes to our common foreign policy. We have to make that effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree – and this is my third point, because I have heard numerous opinions which are just not realistic – with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said, that compromises are needed. Compromises are also needed because you will be debating the problem of Iraq tomorrow. There are a number of issues where I believe, if you pass a resolution, the Presidency and the Commission and the European Union will be able to move forward, such as the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq, including – as one member said – on the Turkish border, the need to deal with serious humanitarian problems by mobilising the aid provided for and the central role of the United Nations in the political, economic and social reconstruction of Iraq. If we say it here loud and clear, we shall create frameworks, we shall create commitments. And, of course, we must not forget the peace process in the Middle East and the importance of transatlantic relations. The Union's foreign policy, like every other policy, is created. This endeavour has its triumphs and setbacks, but the policy is still created. And it is up to us. If we simply say that the Union is out of its depth and we throw in the towel, then we do not want a Union. But we do want a Union! And we want a strong Union. That is what we are striving for and that is what we must strive for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to a number of comments made on economic policy. First of all, this is a long Presidency text because it is now standard practice in the Union for each spring Council to reiterate all the previous resolutions for the record. The second point is that there are numerous questions, references and issues which refer back to committees, but if you read the text and the texts it refers to, such as the resolutions of the Εcofin Council, you will see that many of the issues raised are answered. The Stability Pact, for example, was examined by the Ministers for Finance, who said that it must be maintained, that this is neither the time nor the place for flexibility and that there is a risk of inflation. I leave it to you to decide whether or not they were right. It was examined. That is clear from the text. It is also clear from the text that war can upset the best-laid plans. It is important to remain level-headed. It is important not to panic, not to believe that we need to take measures here and now or here, there and everywhere. We need to keep moving steadily forward on the course we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is one of the main messages of the efforts made in Brussels; that despite the adversities, despite the difficulties, we have a great deal in common, a great deal in common, which we cannot put to one side, which is why, especially in these difficult times, we need to try and express what we have in common and move forward together.</p>

Instead, we should have turned our attention to the future. In my view, it is incomprehensible that, in recent days, so many people have expended so much effort on working out how to deplore the decision taken by the American and British governments concerning military action in Iraq, an action to which my country subscribes.</p>
<p class="contents">If we did in fact have to be backward-looking, we could have made better use of our time and energy in working out how to condemn the Iraqi regime, which for 12 years has ignored every UN resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the coalition that is responsible for the war in Iraq; it is Saddam Hussein and his regime. I must therefore vote against conclusion number 3, and I am unable to deplore or regret the decision taken by the coalition. It was Saddam Hussein who forced them to take it.</p>
<p class="contents">By an unfortunate turn of events, Saddam Hussein has succeeded in dividing our world, and we must hope that the day will soon come when he can be brought before an international court and tried for his crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we must look forward, as in part does the resolution, I am pleased to say. Now, it is a question of preventing as much suffering as possible in the wake of the war. The Iraqi people have suffered enough. We must therefore be ready to come to their aid, and as soon as possible. We must take joint responsibility for peace and freedom in Iraq. We must help the Iraqi people to a dignified life in a democratic society, a community founded on the rule of law in which human rights are observed and minorities respected. That is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That resolution was and still is in keeping both with the real problems in the world and the feelings and reactions of the citizens in our countries who, in their reactions to this illegal, immoral, pre-emptive and therefore subjugating war, expressed themselves as European citizens, and formulated the only serious and reliable basis on which we can continue to build Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us here are concerned about the future of the world and of Europe. However, there are others here whose sole concern is to justify their governments, to sanction after the event decisions which will cause the modern world system and the international community – surely a misnomer now – to disappear. The Te Deum for the demise of the UN offered up in all sincerity by Mr Pearl doubtless also applied to the marginalisation of the European Union, both old and new, whatever some of the candidate countries may think.</p>
<p class="contents">This humiliation will continue if we somehow sanction the invasion of Iraq after the event. There is no doubt as to who will gain the upper hand militarily and technologically: the invaders. But why should we turn their technical supremacy into political victory by feeling compelled to condone the war once it is over? The only thing we have a historical duty to do is to prepare our contribution to a more balance world, insofar as this is still possible; to make a quantum leap, as quickly as possible, on the road towards political unification, especially in the field of foreign policy and defence. Those of us who have no intention of letting Europe and the world change into a sort of Jurassic Park must move forward. Those here who are willing to achieve more must unravel the contradictions into which their selfish, divisive choices are forcing them on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">A great British playwright, Harold Pinter said – and some members would do well to remember this – that unless Europe finds the solidarity, intelligence, courage and will to challenge and resist US power Europe itself will deserve Alexander Herzen's definition: ‘We are not the doctors.

<p class="contents">With the agreement of the Security Council this war would still have been illegitimate but now it is both illegal and illegitimate. It is also, unfortunately, barbaric. The power of the bombs dropped by the Americans and the British on that unfortunate country has doubtless already exceeded that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. President Bush has spoken of a crusade. This one will no doubt meet the same fate as the last one. I salute the courageous resistance of the Iraqi people. I ask my Kurdish friends not to place too much trust in American promises. They know what those promises are worth. I hope that one day those who are responsible for this war – Bush, Aznar and Blair – will have to answer for their actions before an international court.</p>

We should be helping to find ways out of the crisis. Firstly, the war must be brought to an end as speedily as possible, with the minimum possible damage being done to people, and Saddam Hussein and his criminal regime being disarmed. Secondly, the Iraqi people must then have the opportunity to take their own decisions, and the United Nations – rather than one of the belligerent parties – must assume responsibility for the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">To this reconstruction, thirdly, the European Union must make a determined contribution, it being in its own primary interest that peaceful development should take root both in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens. Fourthly, we must reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership and rebuild a relationship of trust with the United States of America, which will, for the foreseeable future, remain the only power capable of guaranteeing order and security on a global and regional scale. All credit for that to the Americans, to whom we Germans owe a great deal, for they stood up for our freedom at a time when that freedom was menaced by Soviet Communism. Then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital, Berlin. It is for those reasons that I am in solidarity with the United States, even though this solidarity has a critical edge to it from time to time. Solidarity of this sort is not to be abandoned out of hand when there are differences of opinion, for we see no alternatives to the Atlantic Alliance, any more than there are alternatives to European unification.</p>

After those events we all agreed that the world had changed. We appreciated that global terrorism, a terrorism well-financed and organised with no clear political objective beyond creating chaos, required a new approach to security. It was clear that we can no longer take a passive approach. We can no longer sit on the sidelines tut-tutting when faced with dangerous, repressive regimes prepared to murder their own people, threaten regional security and nurture terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw that we needed a pro-active approach, we needed to develop a concept of global justice for all people and to build a worldwide security system based on active involvement. We followed through on that in relation to Afghanistan, but now when faced with a difficult and dangerous crisis, we seem to have retreated into a comfort zone of our old certainties. We have particularly retreated to the cold war attitude towards the United States. We feel that the transatlantic relationship is some sort of zero-sum game. For one side to win, the other side has to lose. If we continue that process the world will become much more secure because every issue and every crisis will be divisive as we try to gather around separate poles. We need transatlantic partnership for the benefit of world security.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not re-fight old battles. It may well be that the structures we set up after the second world war are not suitable for dealing with the post-September 11 world. In that case we should be working to the future, thinking about how we rebuild Iraq with United Nations support and how we secure peace in Iraq whilst respecting the rights of Iraqi people to their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I speak, many thousands of my own countrymen and women are putting their lives at risk to free a people from tyranny. Many people do not agree with that war and I respect their views but I ask that this Chamber respects the position of the men and women whose lives are at risk. I am frankly amazed that, amongst all this talk of legality, I have not heard one word about Iraqi treatment of prisoners of war, which is contrary to the Geneva Convention. I have not heard one word of condemnation of Iraqi troops killing their own people in Basra. Imagine what British troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it.</p>

I also think, however, that we must all acknowledge that this stage in the discussion is now finished and that we in Parliament must stop shadow-boxing with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, we all agree that Saddam Hussein has been categorically opposing the United Nations for the past 12 years. Throughout his rule he has oppressed his people and violated international law in many areas. That is why the members of the Security Council accepted Resolution 1441, and they must therefore now bear the consequences. Anyone who does not do so is, despite protests to the contrary and perhaps also unintentionally, implicitly helping to keep Saddam in power. Explain that to the inhabitants of Basra, who are being fired at by their own Iraqi army.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not help international law and the Iraqi people in the slightest. The crisis once more makes it painfully clear that we need a European foreign and security policy and ultimately a European defence force so that we can play a role in the next crisis. It is no use lecturing other people about international values if you are not able to enforce international law yourself.</p>
<p class="contents">I felt that the European summit was not able to avoid deadlock on its other subject, the Lisbon process. Of course, this will get us nowhere when it comes to economic liberalisation. Good intentions are all very well, but I would like to see the Commission set up a strict schedule for the implementation of the measures so that the Member States can be reminded of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, therefore, I warmly welcome Commissioner Monti’s initiative in investigating the banned state support for the French energy group <span class="italic">Electricité de France</span>. It is absolutely essential that we complete the internal market in order to be able to continue to compete with the USA and Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even today as imperialist aggression is on the rampage in Baghdad and Basra, Mr Simitis, ignoring the fact that a nation is being murdered in Iraq as we speak, is concerned solely with how big business can increase its profits. Mr Simitis did not have the sensitivity to express even the slightest criticism of the invaders out of respect for the feelings of the overwhelming majority of our people, the millions denouncing this illegal and criminal imperialist incursion and calling for an immediate end to it. Of course he talked of the need to restore peace in the region, once the imperialists have won you understand, but his main concern was how Iraq is to be divided up.</p>
<p class="contents">The complicity of the European Union was also confirmed by the European Council, which basically covered for the members of the European Union taking an active part in the war and all the other countries providing every sort of facility for the invaders, with the Presidency's country at the top of the list. And those who sign and support motions for resolutions in the European Parliament which do not clearly and frankly condemn this crime and call for an immediate end to it are equally guilty of complicity.</p>
<p class="contents">The dirty imperialist war met with heroic resistance from a nation defending its national independence, awakened consciences and provoked massive and continual demonstrations of protest. The war was an excellent opportunity to reinforce the so-called Lisbon strategy and promote measures to step up the attack which, in the name of competitiveness, is directly affecting the employment, social, insurance and pension rights of the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy will not go unanswered.

<p class="contents">I want to pick up on certain aspects where, for once – unlike last year's Spring Summit- we looked at issues relating to global equity to some extent. For example, Paragraph 60 onwards of the Presidency Conclusions mentioned promoting sustainable development on a global scale. Those Conclusions talked about enhancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility, both at EU level and internationally. I would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis – rather than giving them to your rich friends.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conclusions also mention the means of promoting sustainable and fair trade. I wonder if we have actually proofed some of the other policies that we came up with at this Spring Summit against those ambitions or, indeed, ambitions to encourage export credits that are consistent with sustainable development when certain Member States pay out over 50% of their export credits to enable arms deals to go ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in the aftermath of this Spring Summit, we are going to pay attention to the policies that we talked about there. I hope that we are going to carry those forward seriously, because we need to examine this ideal of becoming the world's most internationally competitive continent in the light of asking ourselves what the implications are for the global losers if we are the global winners, and what this is going to do to enhance stability, equality and justice in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, these are the cornerstones of European integration. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats attempted to table a resolution on the basis of the Council’s declaration. Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible. Some of the approaches put forward seem to aim in practice at calling for the European Union to become part of the movement of non-aligned countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My group argues on the contrary for strengthening the transatlantic axis as a strategic priority for the European Union. We agree with the Council on this. It is therefore somewhat surprising to hear the Commission praise an initiative for common defence beyond the territory of the Union. It might be termed an extra-Community venture. No eyebrows should be raised if others now table further proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council devoted a good deal of time to discussion of the eagerly awaited post-war period. It sent out an unequivocal call for European Union involvement in rebuilding Iraq. I congratulate it on that. I would however point out that at present what is required of us is humanitarian aid for those most in need. I would have welcomed more specific details of action taken by the Commission in that regard. I trust this objective will unite us all, and that we will be prepared to regroup under the European flag as we strive towards it.</p>

However, the peace demonstrators have stood up in the whole of Europe and throughout the world in order to protest against the strongest military power in the world. Without the backing of the UN Security Council, the United States has attacked Iraq, but we now know that their battle plans had been ready for a long time. We believed that a peaceful solution was possible in Iraq, thanks to the intervention of the inspectors, but the decision had already been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">All wars in the Middle East have always ended in disaster. Why, then, are we incapable of learning the lessons of history? Our construction of Europe is based on right, rather than might. Yes, but we cannot deny that the European Union is experiencing a real crisis. What is this right that we are talking about? How can we forget Article 11 of the Maastricht Treaty, which compels all Member States to define and implement a common security policy in line with the United Nations Charter? The UN Charter has been flouted. Article 2 of that Charter asks all States to refrain from threatening the territorial or political integrity of any other State or to use force against that integrity. What has happened to our compliance with that article? Does this mean that there is no longer any law, any treaty, or any charter which is able to resist the law of the strongest power? That is a frightening thought. It would be a defeat for democracy, and we do not accept it. This war is a disaster from the moral viewpoint. All the great principles of our civilisation cannot be trampled underfoot in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">What price will we have to pay for this inability to learn lessons from the past and for the fact that we have delayed too long in building a political Europe that would be capable of facing up to the United States? It is time for us to react if we want a strong and independent Europe. It is time for us to put in place a common defence policy, and it will be necessary for us to provide ourselves with the resources to do so. We need to move, to make the Convention a success and to make our future together a success too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present war is directly in line with so many other wars fought in the past by the great powers, by Britain and the United States, but also by Germany and France, acting sometimes together and sometimes against one another, in order to exploit the Middle East and to plunder its wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Words such as liberty, democracy and the condemnation of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship are merely hypocrisy to conceal a war of banditry. While the armies of the two greatest powers in the world are still crushing Baghdad beneath their bombs and forcing the inhabitants of Basra to die of hunger and thirst, their major companies are already sharing juicy contracts, like vultures squabbling over the corpse of a country that they are in the process of murdering. At the European Council, ministers from countries taking part in the aggression against Iraq and those from countries claiming to be opposed to the war came together to produce a single declaration, as if nothing had happened.

It is unfair, because it kills innocent people, and, as the Arab proverb says, a killer is never a benefactor. Despite that massive rejection of this war by public opinion, the Council remains silent, whereas we ought to have condemned it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simplistic to believe that the objective of the United States is to control energy resources.

It must help to create conditions in which the rights of nations can be respected and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States can be guaranteed. In order to do this, however, it urgently needs to provide itself with a common foreign and defence policy. The future of Europe depends on it. Do we want to have a Europe of soldiers in the service of an American empire, or a Europe of independent citizens who respect fundamental rights?

Europe has to have a single foreign policy and a single defence policy, to take a leading role on the international stage and to be able to guarantee peace outside its borders. We will have to achieve this objective during the second half of this year and, in this connection, I must reply to the disagreeable words spoken by Mr Watson, who clearly knows little about and has difficulty recognising what it means to be pro-European. Clearly, as far as he is concerned, being pro-European means always saying yes, but if we sometimes say no, we might build a better Europe. It would be an extremely grave political error not to heal the present divisions. The Italian Government’s statements which move in this direction certainly give us hope, and I believe President Prodi will be in agreement with the Italian Prime Minister when he meets with him in Rome on Friday.</p>
<p class="contents">The strong, influential political Europe of the future cannot, however, be created with an anti-American stance. It is appropriate to point this out in this Chamber for there are still those in Europe who place the greatest western democracy and Saddam Hussein’s despotic, criminal regime on the same level. The killer’s name is Saddam Hussein; we cannot and must not adhere to the slogan: ‘Neither Bush nor Saddam’. When Europe has rediscovered the reasons for its strong unity, it will have to participate directly, under the aegis of the United Nations, in the construction of the new Iraqi democracy, once it has assisted with the humanitarian needs, the result of a conflict which Saddam Hussein could have avoided by accepting his proposed exile, mentioned several times by Mr Pannella. It must be a Europe which has relations with the moderate Arab countries, which strives for the security of Israel and for the construction of a new Palestinian state: in short, a Europe which guarantees peace in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are here in Parliament, not least on behalf of those European people, of that public opinion referred to by the Council, to hold to account first of all those European governments which have supported, are assisting and are participating in a unilateral war which we condemn unreservedly. We are on day seven, and the dramatic events tell us that it will not be a <span class="italic">blitzkrieg</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, our anti-war position does not mean siding with that regime, which must account for its crimes before international courts, and it does not mean being indifferent to the dangerous path being opened up by the violation of international law and the many other violations, such as the use of prohibited weapons, the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people, the treatment of prisoners and the fate of the Kurdish people. Then there is the Middle East. Certain interventionist quarters have said that this war will resolve the Middle East question. We do not think this is the case. We can see that things are getting increasingly worse: on the one hand, this war is helping the extremist, group Hamas, and, on the other, the Israeli army is continuing its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to ask the European governments: what are you gaining from this terrible experience? I would like to say to the Member States: incorporate, introduce federalist elements into your European foreign policy. If you do not do so, we will not have a common policy. Can you not see that, even without powers, the Commission is currently a point of reference while the role of the High Representative has been destroyed because of your differences? Once again – it has already happened in the Balkans – we are powerless and at a highly critical time. Remember that the sum total of 15 or 25 national policies which satisfy longstanding interests, will never constitute a European foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What a disgrace it is that there are so many apologists for Saddam Hussein in this Chamber. Listening to them I now understand the concept of the big lie.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to the British, American and other armed forces engaged in Iraq and express my condolences to those families of our servicemen that have suffered loss. My own constituency of East Anglia has lost Tornado aircrew from Royal Air Force Marham in Norfolk. The Colchester-based 16 Air Assault Brigade is also very much in the front line of the conflict, along with units from all over the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge the strong moral and practical support for the coalition from the governments of Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and so many other European countries. However, this is a conflict which could have been avoided had the international community spoken with genuine resolve and made it clear to Saddam that it was united in its determination to disarm his regime with speed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the poisonous thread that has run through the diplomatic manoeuvrings in the run-up to the Iraq war has been anti-Americanism. It is this same vitriolic anti-Americanism which inspires so many in this House and elsewhere to try to build separate EU structures to replace those in which our American friends have a key role. I am thinking particularly of the European security and defence policy, which is not about security but about the trappings of the EU State. It creates no additional military capabilities, just duplicative and divisive structures from which important allies are deliberately excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a time when we should be doing just the opposite. When the conflict in Iraq is over, North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise the transatlantic alliance before it is too late.

In ‘Le Monde’, Alain Pellet took the view that ‘aggression is still aggression, even if it is on the part of a great democratic empire and directed against a bloody tyranny’. This is especially the case when such aggression begins at the very point when the Security Council and the inspectors are succeeding in keeping Saddam Hussein's regime in check and are beginning to disarm it. I am particularly struck by the fact that a section of Europe's governments is the cause of many deaths and injuries, and, indeed, of massive destruction in an already poverty-stricken country, or at least regards such things as acceptable, for private wars such as this can also be uncommonly contagious.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reassured, though, by the fact that Europe's people condemn this war and have no wish to dance blindly and uncritically to the US administration's tune. Europe's citizens give us cause for hope, and their love of peace should be the foundation on which we construct a common foreign and security policy. The USA's status as a military hyperpower means, however, that it will not work without a military component. We simply have to be prepared to consult among ourselves on where we should concentrate our military expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The next test of our mettle, though, is almost upon us. With firms close to the US administration – such as a subsidiary of Halliburton – being awarded government contracts worth billions, and, according to newspaper reports, British firms also queuing up in America to get their slice of the cake, Europe is organising humanitarian aid, but it must not stop at that. We have to use a Security Council mandate as a means of gaining for ourselves a substantial role in the reconstruction of Iraq, of an Iraq in which all – Sunni, Shia, and Kurd – can live in freedom and peace, free from dictatorship whether at home or abroad. Taking it for granted as I do that nobody will have anything like the decisiveness required to implement the UN's resolutions on Palestine and Israel, it will again be Europe that has to take action for a just solution in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless hope that Great Britain and a number of other supporters of this American war will spare a thought for Europe and slowly come to realise that, in the coalition of the willing, the only will that counts is that of the USA. I do not believe that Europe exists to pick up the pieces left behind by others; on the contrary, we need our own identity and our own common foreign and security policy!</p>

It has too many repercussions for that, not only on the surrounding region, but also on Europe. This also means that it is otiose to wonder whether it might perhaps have been possible to prevent it. Saddam Hussein himself could certainly have prevented it, if he had kept to at least one of the seventeen resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. It would also have been one of his primary duties to give his people, whom he had decimated with weapons of mass destruction, the chance of a decent existence as human beings by ensuring that the sanctions imposed on his country could be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">We can but hope and try to do whatever we can to prevent these innocent people from having to pay a high price for this regime and for the war it has caused. I can also understand why many people take to the streets in a kind of impotent rage, believing as they do that warfare cannot, in the twenty-first century, be a legitimate political tool. I can also sympathise with the Catholic Church and the Pope, whose attempts right up to the last moment to prevent armed conflict were, in the final analysis, motivated by concern for the Christian minority in Iraq, and were, alas, rewarded by no more success. Diplomacy stood not the least chance of success, and all the peacekeeping institutions that arose out of the aftermath of the Second World War – the UN, NATO, the European Union – have sustained damage.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Europeans, there is just one question left to be answered, and that is whether we still have the desire to influence the course of world history or whether we want to opt out. If we are to stay in, the first thing that will be needed is a reshaping of the trans-Atlantic relationship, and the second will be a definition of the fields of action in which the European Union has to assume responsibility in the context of security policy. This should also determine what resources are allocated to enable such a policy to be actually implemented. Any policy must in any case be founded upon the common interests of all, and must enable Europe to be one of the poles in a multipolar world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a war, we said, would not be in compliance with either international law or the United National Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">An illegal and neo-colonial war is currently underway. Every day it shows us its real face. Instead of condemning it and calling on the Security Council to ensure that international peace and regional peace are respected immediately, the European Council of 20 March was unable to agree on anything other than an anodyne declaration. This declaration said that the United Nations must continue to play a central role during and after the crisis. The word ‘continue’ here is doubtless a bad joke which slipped into the text by mistake, because before the crisis the United Nations, as we all know, had been flouted and swept aside by the United States, with the complicity of two Member States of the European Union. The absence of any formal Commission proposals and the rule of unanimity no doubt explain why the European Council was incapable of looking after the interests of the European Union, and incapable of saying, loudly and clearly, that the interests of the Union are best protected by multilateral action and that the rule of law is always preferable to the law of the strongest power.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush now has the war he always wanted, the war that he decided to wage a long time ago. As one French newspaper described him, he is in the position of a new-look Doctor Strangelove. Ample proof has now been provided that some Member States do not want an independent common foreign and security policy. Well, political Europe will be constructed without them, in the same way as monetary union was. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, many fine words have been spoken about the significance of the Lisbon process. The objective was to catch up with the United States economically by 2010. Unfortunately, this has been mostly a matter of words. I have still not seen the necessary reforms of the labour market that are a condition for growth and so also for more jobs. Nor has the equally important liberalisation of, for example, the gas and electricity markets taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparison with the United States clearly shows how far we are from achieving the targets set in Lisbon. In the United States, the economic situation is considered to be very worrying, in spite of the fact that growth is significantly higher in the US than within the EU. The Americans have made it clear that they will not just sit and watch while the economy deteriorates. They have responded with deep tax cuts. That is something which the EU Member States should also do, and as a matter of urgency. If a country like the United States, with its relatively low taxes, can reduce them further, so too in all likelihood can the EU Member States, throughout which taxes are significantly higher.</p>
<p class="contents">An employment strategy was discussed at the European Council, but no such strategy will ever provide increased growth and lower unemployment. There are no short cuts. We do not need any more fine words or proud declarations. Action is what we need. As long as the EU just talks while the United States takes action, the economic gap will continue to widen, to America’s advantage. The year 2010 will continue to recede ever further into the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me get to the point and say that I am thinking of Afghanistan. There, we all joined together in doing our bit in a just cause; we were all glad of the degree of success we achieved in combating terrorism in that country, and there was agreement among ourselves that the people of this earth, be they Muslim or Christian, should not have to be at war with each other. It was precisely for this reason that we succeeded in Afghanistan, for we were able to make it clear to Muslims that it was side by side with Muslims that terrorists had to be fought.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Iraq, though, is quite different. There, we have not yet succeeded in persuading Muslims that a war there is as necessary as it was in Afghanistan, and their scepticism is something I share. While there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it, this war is – unfortunately – a reality. My fear is that, this being so, we will, once this war is over, have to deal with the problem of huge differences of outlook between Muslims and Christians. It is probable that, after the war, much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again. Where some things are concerned, we will have to begin again from the ground up in order to convince Muslims that Christians do not actually have anything against them. Unfortunately, though, it will not be possible to get that point across to the Muslims in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also, however, deplore the challenging behaviour of Saddam Hussein who has continually managed to ignore the UN resolutions. Most of all I feel sorry for the victims and regret the human suffering that is without doubt much greater than we can imagine.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretting and hoping that the war will soon be over is not all that there remains for us to do, however. We still have our responsibility for the future. We must try to alleviate the suffering by immediately making every effort to provide humanitarian aid. We must strengthen our relationships with Arab countries and give the Mediterranean dialogue a real chance to succeed. We must invest as much as possible in a definitive peace process in the Middle East. We must also not forget about repairing transatlantic relationships, whilst enforcing respect for our autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. Last but not least, however, we must do all we can to eliminate the divisions in the European Union. Our Member States must use the old, tried-and-trusted European formula and talk to each other, even on matters relating to foreign affairs and security policy. It is high time all the Member States together took another look at the common foreign and security policy and the defence policy, and the best place for that is the European Convention. There is a working party there that is actively working on foreign policy, and there is also a working party there that is actively working on defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The people in the Convention are motivated to talk to each other and to everyone; they are not divided into groups according to the fault lines that the Iraq crisis has exposed. Let us encourage the Convention to reorganise its powers and its structure in such a way that the political will to cooperate is at least given a chance and encouraged to develop where it is lacking, and let us force the heads of government to sit down together, particularly when things get difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is something surrealistic – and in fact disgusting – about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will, however, move on now to the economic part of the Spring Summit, focusing upon two aspects: progress in innovation and enterprise, and environmental protection. Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-stop re-run of the Delors White Paper. That is also somewhat surrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as research and development is concerned, let me be positive. I am glad that Commissioner Prodi is going to look at the EIB because, frankly, that institution is inefficient and ineffective in aiding those firms which could be innovative and competitive if they just had that helping hand. Good for him.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as environmental protection is concerned, let me highlight intelligent energy, for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament. This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission – it should have started in January this year. That is not efficient, and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic <span class="italic">à la</span> Lisbon Declaration. This programme, I am sad to say, has been cut by the Council. As rapporteur, I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen.

If we do not want the war to halt the path towards the Constitutional Treaty and towards joint foreign and defence policies, we have to prevent the rift which has divided Europe in recent weeks deepening. We were in agreement in condemning Saddam’s regime; however, we had different opinions on pre-emptive, unilateral war, since mainly innocent victims pay the price for war and since the post-war situation is still completely unclear. But what is the realistic thing to do now? We have to avoid making it more difficult for dialogue between old allies who feel the weight of their responsibility for the world’s future. We must participate in providing humanitarian aid, granting the United Nations the central role of the mandate also in the subsequent stage, in reconstructing Iraq. We must heal the rift between Europeans starting with what unites us. This is the challenge which the Spring European Council tried to keep sight of and this is why President Prodi also reminded us of the burden of war on Europe’s economic revival. This is the challenge that Parliament too must address. We must take steps towards peace – starting with peace in the Middle East – and towards the political unity of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in Iraq is in contravention of Item E of the Council Conclusions. For the war in Iraq is not sustainable; it is bringing suffering and devastation upon the people and is weakening across the board the industrialised countries' position in the global context of sustainable development. Money is being wasted on it rather than being put into sustainable investment. In the United States, it has been estimated that the war will cost USD 90 billion in the best-case scenario, and USD 1 000 billion at worst. We have already gone beyond the best-case scenario, as the war has already gone on longer than the USD 90 billion estimate assumed. That far exceeds the mere USD 50 billion that all the industrial nations together spend in a year on development cooperation. In view of this, we can indeed say that money is being wasted rather than being spent in a sustainable way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I get the feeling that sustainable development is being relegated to the bottom of the list even within the European Union. On the credit side, I acknowledge that reference is made to the promotion of environmental technology and of clean transport, but I do believe that we have to generally press forward with more vigorous ecological renewal of our industrialised society if employment is to be generated and sustainable development advanced, as, without it, both these objectives will remain beyond our reach. So clear benchmarks are needed for what we want and for the methods that will enable us to monitor it; sustainable development needs clear goals and clear indicators in the same way as employment policy does, for sustainability is not a fig leaf, but a modern garment that would suit the EU well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I noticed that the emphasis at this summit was on industrial policy and entrepreneurship, which I believe to be justified in today’s adverse political and economic conditions. We must place the emphasis on the real economy. I believe, however, that this should also filter through to other files that were mentioned in the summit conclusions. This is called ‘coherence of policy’. I would in particular like to mention the takeover directive, the new merger regime and public procurement procedures. It would also be appropriate to place greater emphasis on the effects these have on the economy. I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to tell us how they assess these effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council has decided to set up a European employment task force, and in the debate in the plenary session held in preparation for this summit this plan, which was the bright idea of Blair, Chirac and Schroeder, took me by surprise because these self-same governments are making impending concrete policy plans more difficult. I was referring to the temporary employment directive on which the Council of Ministers has still not taken a common position, even though the directive is a key example of the kind of flexibility and security we must have in the labour market. It is particularly disappointing that it is taking so long for the position to be taken. I myself was very surprised that the Council’s conclusions are now mentioning December 2003, whereas on 6 March the Council of Ministers was talking about efforts to arrive at a common position by the June session. I would therefore like clarification on this point. As far as the task force is concerned, new ideas are always welcome, but it is actions that are most important.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns pensions. The summit brought to a conclusion the first open coordination cycle on pensions. It is a good thing that a second cycle has been agreed and that the accession countries will also be specifically involved in this one. I am assuming – and I would also appreciate confirmation of this – that the interim evaluation that was scheduled for 2004 is still in the planning stage, and I would in particular like to see the Commission and the Council put forward concrete proposals to solve the labour mobility problems and fiscal problems surrounding pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been calls for some Western leaders to be brought before the International Criminal Court. Such statements are sectarian, irresponsible and deny themselves all legitimacy inasmuch as they fail to call for the same treatment to be meted out to Saddam Hussein although he alone is responsible for this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">No single political group or Member of this House has a monopoly over the cause of peace. I can understand that this cause generates strong emotions. There are two possible responses to the impotence demonstrated by the European Union. One such response involves behaving in an insulting and dismissive manner, casting blame on each other and perverting the noble cause of peace for particular national interests. A Member of this House did so referring to the situation in the Basque country. He failed to ascribe any responsibility for that situation to those who attack freedoms in the area on a daily basis or to those who have been in government there for over 20 years. The alternative response involves the responsible approach adopted by the Greek Presidency, making a virtue out of a necessity. The Presidency endeavoured to learn the lessons of this crisis and take a long hard look at the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has actually become an economic power. It is now a commercial, financial and industrial power. Unfortunately, however, it does not make its weight felt as it should in the international context. Consequently there is currently no alternative to the transatlantic axis, Mr President, at least regarding security and defence. This is probably due to our own shortcomings. Each and every one of us is to blame for the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I therefore wish to condemn the cynicism and hypocrisy of many Members of this House. They talk until they are blue in the face about the need for a common security and defence policy. When they go back in their constituencies, however, they are incapable of asking their voters to endow that same security and defence policy with the necessary resources. They have failed to understand that a united Europe can be strong whereas a divided Europe is bound to be weak.</p>

<p class="contents">I am here to talk about Lisbon, however, and I think that the agreement reached at the Council about common action by the European governments is an important element of political stability with the present split in Europe. It was important, in these difficult times, for the European governments to express a common political will to continue their efforts in the social field. It is equally important for these targets to be closely linked to education and research. This meets the expectations of European citizens, who know full well that we cannot achieve more and better jobs and greater economic growth without education and research.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, of course, have to be highly critical when it comes to meeting the targets. We are seriously behind schedule, as everyone admits, and that should spur us on to even greater effort. In order to make progress, we need more cooperation on investment programmes in all sectors, including training and lifelong learning which, together with education and research, are communicating vessels. Education must prove that it knows how to incorporate European culture and sciences, the learning process, in order to produce learned students with job prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me give a few examples of what I mean. The Barcelona Summit decided on a study of what are termed the Basle II effects on small and medium-sized enterprises and banks. To date, it has not been completed. I take the view that if any study is completed only after the Basle Committee has produced its resolution and after the Commission has decided on a draft directive, it amounts to the squandering of money, to a betrayal of trust and to treating with disdain the resolutions of Parliament and of the Council. No sooner do we decide on the Stability and Growth Pact, than people question it – some because of Lisbon, some because of the war in Iraq, and others because they lack the courage to reform or because it threatens their comfortable positions. Rather than ignoring resolutions, we should be implementing them and taking them seriously!</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Council resolved unanimously to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and knowledge-based continent, a continent fostering social cohesion, promoting sustainability and creating new jobs. Where is the actual timetable? Where are the detailed objectives? Where is the road map? Where are the specific and verifiable programmes in all the Member States? Good and ambitious objectives need to be followed up by concrete action, or else we lose credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to Iraq. We are working towards a common foreign, security and defence Policy, but when it comes to the crunch, each does his own thing. We want to strengthen the UN, but not even the EU's two permanent members of the Security Council are making any effort to find a common approach. As President Prodi has shown us, we make demands of the Convention, yet we fail to comply with our own codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a chance; it is called ‘more Europe’. It is also called ‘more United Nations’. We will find our opportunity if we stop setting national interests against European objectives, what nations do against what Europe resolves, the trans-Atlantic alliance against a self-confident and enlarged European Union. Let us follow up the summits with the necessary actions, and let us punish with sanctions any breaches of the Treaties for political reasons. Those who do not take themselves seriously will not be taken seriously by others, and a more serious approach to things will be worth our while. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that two trains are going to collide head-on here, all because we are arguing about who is slightly more, or slightly less, to blame in this matter. I too have my own personal views on the subject, but they will not help us to make any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow our capacity for action to be destroyed now by a dispute about who did what badly three or four weeks ago or six months ago, with this war as the result of it. We should bear in mind the fact that essential elements are at issue here. This is about such questions as how we deal with the victims, and how we secure the region's stability, as well as about Europe's capacity for action in the Middle East and about how we, within the Quartet framework, at last bring about sound solutions. How can we, in this matter, put this failure on Europe's part to good use in order to move the Convention forward, in order to prevent Europe's weakness being the cause of the next such situation, and how do we acquire capacity for action by means of better mechanisms that enable us to unchain the political will that we share?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is about how we handle trans-Atlantic relations in future, about in what ways we can put them on new and more stable foundations. How do we gain acceptance for our knowledge that force is not the appropriate way to create a new world order? In particular, how do we save a multilateral world founded upon compromise and upon mutual respect?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering, the chairman of my group, made reference to Richard Perle. I do not consider it acceptable for the United States to oblige others to accept its unilateral approach. The United States cannot decide, alone and on the basis of its own national interests, what is right in this world and what is not. That approach, which Mr Perle advocates, for example in an article in today's ‘Berliner Zeitung’, is quite simply unacceptable, for it means that we Europeans have no part whatever in any decisions affecting our vital interests; it means that we are unable to defend our interests, and also prevents us from making any contribution to world peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that it will come to a speedy end. Generally speaking, this conflict brings three thoughts to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, how can we learn from our differences, so that the European Union can find itself again at last, and can speak with a united voice in international affairs? The European Union was built up over time and through various trials. More often than not, great advances have followed serious crises. The trial that Europe is currently passing through is not the first and it will certainly not be the last. and we must therefore be optimistic. The most important thing is to examine and to understand, after the war, the reasons for our present differences. Are they fundamental reasons? Are our positions irreversible and irreconcilable? If they are, that will cause serious difficulties in the future. Is it not more likely that they are merely the result of a lack of consultation and coordination? It seems to me that it is now a matter of urgency that Europe, without harming its transatlantic partnership, should provide itself with the means of being independent and powerful, and should provide itself with a real common foreign and defence policy. Independence does not mean breaking alliances.</p>
<p class="contents">My second thought is about the future of Iraq. This time, the United Nations must fully play its part in the reconstruction of Iraq, so that the country can provide itself with a representative government which is willing to live in peace with its neighbours and is capable of playing an active part within the international community. Reconstruction must be carried out, first and foremost, for the benefit of the Iraqi people who have suffered so much for so many years. The Iraqis must at last be able to benefit from their country’s wealth, which is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I wonder whether we have the capacity to give an appropriate welcome to the candidate countries next year. Are we ready? That is what we should be asking ourselves. In order to welcome the candidate countries in the best possible circumstances, it seems that three conditions will need to be met. Firstly, we need to be reconciled on the subject of our values. Why should those not be the values of the old Europe? Secondly, our institutions, which find it difficult enough to operate when there are only fifteen Member States, need to be changed, and that means that the Convention must complete its work in the best possible conditions. Thirdly, we have to be able to cope financially. I have set out the problem, but it is not my job to provide the solution to it. My most cherished hope is that, after this war and after we have passed through this crisis, the Union, whether it has fifteen or twenty-five Member States, will be independent and finally able to speak with a single voice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, the split is between France and Germany, principally, and 19 other pro-US new European governments. Efforts must now be made to tone down the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. I salute the courage of EU candidate countries who have backed the coalition with specialist forces.</p>
<p class="contents">At a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy last week, Britain was accused of being a rogue state headed by a war criminal. This shows the 'Alice in Wonderland'<span class="italic"> </span>level the debate has now reached. By joining forces with Germany in the way it did, France has alienated America, undermined the UN, sent the wrong signals – signals of division – to Baghdad and exposed the impossibility of ever achieving a single foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam Hussein has attempted illegally to acquire weapons of mass destruction for years. Regime change is the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq and prevent ongoing brutalisation of its people by the Butcher of Baghdad. The Allies will install a representative government and must prevent refugees flowing out and instability in the region, as well as facilitating the return of the Iraqi diaspora to rebuild their country in safety. We must guarantee that its massive oil wealth be used to build prosperity for its peoples, not for arms purchases.</p>
<p class="contents">This war is morally and politically justifiable and its legality is vested in current UN Security Council Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441. However, the appeasers in this House might like to explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threats to neighbouring states and that had no UN authority whatsoever, and yet find it so difficult to take action against a genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost a million people and who has gassed his own people. We must end this tyranny and free the Iraqi people once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Lisbon Process, I am delighted that the single market and the need for regulatory impact assessments is now back on the agenda. My party will continue to oppose tax harmonisation. Nevertheless, in this area in particular, action will speak louder than words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is pointless, therefore, at times of crisis, to think of what Europe could be but is not, and throw everything away on this bitter contradiction: throw away 50 years – as President Prodi said – of intelligence, unity, peace, admirable institutional structures and positive results. The Europe which it is possible to have is the current one and therefore let us not feel ashamed to talk of Lisbon, welfare, the labour market, energy, telecommunications, task forces, the Stability Pact or the Convention but let us move forward. This is the only path there is: we are condemned to following this path.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: I feel deeply offended as an MEP, as a European and as an Italian by the irresponsible tolerance which Mr Cox showed for the placards held up by left-wing fellow Members in this Chamber. While ‘Stop the war’ is understandable, it is completely unacceptable for placards with the words ‘Stop the killers’ to be displayed in this Chamber. In Mr Cox’s language, ‘killer’ means ‘murderer’. The United States and the United Kingdom liberated my country 60 years ago, and gave it back democracy and freedom. For the past and for the present, I simply say ‘thank you’ to the United States and the United Kingdom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
