We do this because there is a great concentration of power at the centre of the Union and it is clearly necessary for the citizen to be protected from abuse of that power.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Charter will have three principal effects: first, it will reinforce the constitutional character of the Treaty; secondly, it will be a point of reference for those, including this Parliament, that wish to drive European integration forward with a greater degree of democratic legitimacy; thirdly, a Charter that is stylish and forceful will strengthen the profile of the Union for its present and future citizens. This resolution mandates the European parliamentary delegation inside the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding. A strong vote for this resolution will assist the Convention to complete its task and set criteria for this Parliament’s final appraisal of the results.</p>
<p class="contents">We should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity. The drafting of the Charter will certainly be informed by the application of that principle, but it is crucial that the Charter reflects modern European society with all its pluralism and with all its diversity. The effect of the Charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary. There is also a controversy over the relationship between the new European Union Charter and the existing European Convention of Human Rights. We are proposing that the Union should itself sign up to the ECHR so that those rights inscribed in the existing Convention would form the solid core of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Madame President, our purposes are to write a charter that is so good that Member States will find it shameful to refuse to accept it within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The Charter represents a chance to build a modern post-national society, and marks a bold step forward from the sorrow and the pity of twentieth-century Europe. I strongly commend the resolution.</p>

We are not one people. We do not have the same ethnic origin. We do not speak the same language. We do not have a single culture and religion. Our history bears the marks of war, of war against each other, and Europe’s indistinct borders mean that we cannot even be clearly recognised as a geographical entity.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what is it that binds us together? What enables us to live together? The answer to this may seem insubstantial to many people. Nonetheless, I believe it is the only answer available to us: democracy and human rights. These are what unite Europe. Dubious though some of the things emanating from this continent may have been, in terms of democracy and human rights this continent has sent out a message of indisputable global resonance. In the wake of the twentieth century, the century of great atrocities and crimes to end all crimes, that is this continent’s moral imperative. Human dignity is sacrosanct!</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That is why we cannot rest content with the fact that all Member States have signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights when the European Union has not. That is why it should no longer be deemed appropriate for EU law to infringe national law, the constitutional law of the Member States that is, when the Union itself does not have a clear and comprehensive system of fundamental rights. It should therefore disturb us that fresh fundamental rights conflicts are breaking out in the spheres of information and communication science and biotechnology, but Europe does not have a consensus on fundamental rights with which to provide answers. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why it cannot be a matter of indifference to us that parliamentary and judicial supervision – and thus guarantees of fundamental rights – have been weakened considerably in highly sensitive areas of political union: for example, police and judicial cooperation or foreign and security policy. That is why the European Union will remain incomplete as long as the primacy of the law and the power of the institutions continue to grow in strength, but the citizens’ rights to freedom and to a defence, and the legal guarantees and legal protection they are afforded do not keep pace. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a long, unbroken tradition when it comes to defending fundamental and human rights. That is why the decisions reached at the Cologne and Tampere Summits can be looked on as the fulfilment of the demands Parliament has been making for many a long year. These demands are in keeping with this tradition and they are in the nature of things, in the nature of fundamental rights; in other words, no rights are to be promised unless they are to be made law for the citizens. Legal validity and access to the courts of law is inextricably linked with fundamental and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Exactly the same applies to the indivisibility of fundamental rights. All the policies, institutions and bodies of the European Union must be subject to this Charter of Fundamental Rights. Otherwise, we would be making the citizens of this Union a promise about human rights that would remain nothing more than a proclamation. In other words, we would only be making a pretence of fulfilling the people’s expectations. And today’s resolution, if it is adopted, picks up on one of Parliament’s old demands that has never been so important as it is today. This Charter of Fundamental Rights must form the cornerstone, the foundation of the process we need if we are to provide the European Union with a constitution. We cannot do without this Charter of Fundamental Rights if we are to construct a European democracy in this supranational area.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, perhaps it is one of life’s ironies that you have nominated an Austrian as rapporteur, as co-rapporteur, for this Charter of Fundamental Rights. I am grateful to you for trusting in me, and although it may not be customary practice, with your permission I would very much like to dedicate my contribution over the last few months to this work, to the overwhelming majority of the Austrian population that is defending the great European consensus against deeds and words. Human dignity is sacrosanct!</p>

What I mean to say is that I hope that the damaging amendments made by those who see in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights an attack on democracy, no less, will be rejected. And yet most of these rights already exist in the European Union as they are present in the Treaties, in the European Convention on Human Rights, in the institutional traditions common to the Member States and in the international conventions to which they all subscribe. What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights? This is only the formal ratification, the coherent expression of those sacrosanct individual rights, without which democracy would be reduced to a kingdom where the force of numerical strength reigns and the authorities may do as they please.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union means the peaceful, supportive coexistence of different peoples and cultures, based on its tradition of respect for the rights of individuals. The Charter will become a catalogue of shared principles which define Europe’s identity before the world, an identity which is not based on blood ties, ethnic origin or national allegiance, but, indeed, on common values. In the careful recognition of common rights, there will have to be acknowledgement of those fundamental social rights which are intrinsically no different from the other, more obvious rights, such as the right of freedom to join a trade union, the right to fundamental health and safety in the workplace and training rights, which have never been so essential for growth, employment and competitiveness in the global market as they are now. There will have to be acknowledgement of the political rights of citizens and the human rights of every individual person. Fundamental rights will have to be defined in the face of fresh hazards. A catalogue of fundamental rights which are recognised as binding by the European institutions also sets out the duty of the citizens to respect them. The European Union is a civil, legal area of freedom, which is not just economic freedom but also freedom of security and justice, in a huge territory which, in the past, has been the site of repeated bloodshed. The site of clashes between opposing armies throughout the whole of the first half of the century, Europe is now on the way to becoming a guarantee of peace and freedom from fear and want. This is how we must see the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There is no reason for anyone to be afraid when the prevalence of rights over force is enshrined in the law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So is the American Constitution, namely upon our fundamental European rights and the ideas of John Locke and the French Revolution. American citizens can demand our European rights in their own courts, something which has provided them with empowerment, self-assurance and a pride in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental rights can create identity and citizenship. They can also help individuals to take advantage of opportunities which are now arising in Europe through freedom of movement, the euro and information technology, that is to say the opportunities which are emerging in the new economy. The assets we have as Europeans in the form of cultural differences are easier to maintain and to accept if citizens know that they can claim their rights throughout the Union. Quite simply, freedom of movement demands a basis of guaranteed, fundamental rights. Enlargement of the Union without guaranteed rights could even turn into a fiasco and delay our economic development. A binding Charter is an indispensable requirement and a necessary part of a much-needed constitution. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to warn against joining the Council of Europe’s convention, especially if this step were not to be combined with a binding Charter. These complications ought to be studied more closely. I hope that we are to have a modernised version of the wording of Article 6 of the Council of Europe’s convention in which our already existing rights are listed in a summarised and concentrated form, with modern biotechnology and data protection added. The Charter should be easy to communicate to citizens and be clear to them. It should not be divided into two or contain a whole lot of references. The Charter must be binding and embrace the European institutions. It cannot be fair for citizens to be left without protection against abuses by institutions resembling police forces, such as OLAF and Europol. This project will give rise to more powerful European individuals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Social fundamental rights form part and parcel of traditional fundamental rights. For example, what use is the right to freedom of expression to someone who, owing to poverty and unemployment, suffers complete social exclusion? There are social fundamental rights which, by their very nature, are identical to and, as such, simply form part of, the traditional civil freedom rights. There is, for example, the right of organisation and association which can be extended to the right of free negotiations on working conditions and the right of conducting collective action. These rights should therefore be included in the first part of the charter. </p>
<p class="contents">In the case of other social fundamental rights, there should be a link between the way fundamental rights are worded and the effects thereof on the individual. These fundamental rights are thus often described as instruction standards which are implemented by authorities in social legislation. These are, however, no less essential to the charter as basic elements. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite often, this category of fundamental rights keenly shows up the misconceptions people have as to this charter’s significance at European level. The first misconception is that the EU charter will replace national guarantees for fundamental rights protection, as if, in future, individuals would need to call on the European Union and the European Court rather than their own authorities and courts, and as if fundamental rights on work, housing or social security would all of a sudden become European matters. This is not the case at all. No more so, in actual fact, than is the guarantee of freedom of expression or a fair hearing. The purpose of the charter is to incorporate these fundamental rights in the European institutions and European policy. </p>
<p class="contents">This is, in fact, a reaction to a second common misconception. It is not the case that the charter would only contain rights for which the European Union would be the first authorised port of call. Even where the Union has no authority at all, policy measures which may be taken by or on behalf of the European Union can still infringe fundamental rights. Accordingly, fundamental rights which cannot be guaranteed at EU level but can be violated by the Union, belong in the charter. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on international treaties with regard to social fundamental rights. The opinion of the Social Committee lists a few of these treaties: the Council of Europe’s European social charter and the ILO’s and UN’s core Convention. In Amendment No 22 to the Duff/Voggenhuber report, I argued that a reference to the ECHR should be placed in Article 6 of the Treaty of the Union, and that a reference to the to the ESC should be placed in the ILO’s and the United Nations’ core Conventions. </p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment, regarding a more far-reaching alternative, Amendment No 23, stipulates that the ECHR, as well these social international standards should be acceded to.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last remark regarding the necessity to establish a broad social basis and to enter into a dialogue with social organisations, even after completion of the charter. We will need to conduct this general discussion then too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, what benefit do women in Europe, in particular, stand to gain from this charter and secondly, how does gender mainstreaming, referred to in Article 3, paragraph 2, of the EC Treaty, fit in with this charter? The issue of equality between men and women in Europe, in terms of statutory standardisation, is suffering under the rule of the restrictive headstart. The old equal pay clause underlies a whole structure of equal treatment legislation which now forms part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. These legally binding instruments have proven to be a shot in the arm in the equal treatment of men and women in the Member States. But as these directives and recommendations originated in the objectives of the internal market, it is only logical that they are all confined to the sphere of employment and working conditions. As was recently apparent from the package of draft measures on fighting discrimination based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, there is still great reluctance to view the equal treatment of men and women as an issue which also requires measures outside the labour market. This is a misconception in my view. Discrimination against women is a fact which, unfortunately, is inherent in our social fabric as such. This is why there is still a need to give the equal treatment principle a firm basis in law across the board. An explicit recognition in the forthcoming European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights of a wholesale ban on gender-based discrimination and with it, inclusion in the treaties themselves, would then also create the necessary scope for a new EU policy to promote the position of women in all relevant social fields. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in many discussions on fundamental rights, the rights of women are often relegated to a specific rights’ category. Women as a social category are then lumped together with a host of others such as the handicapped, the elderly, immigrants, etc. Who am I to protest that one type of discrimination is worse than another? Thinking in terms of a hierarchy of fundamental rights is a trap which we should avoid. But this is precisely why we need to underline that women’s rights are not about rights of a specific type of human being which, due to their deviation from the male standard, should be entitled to special protection. Nor are we talking about the rights of a group, as if women were a national minority. </p>
<p class="contents">The rights of women form an integral part of universal human rights, fundamental rights or civil rights. Specific women’s rights do not exist. What does exist is mainstreaming a gender perspective in the discussion of fundamental rights. Issues such as the rights of the family require gender mainstreaming. </p>

They have successfully stated the importance of this matter for the European Parliament, Europe and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this report is to give our fellow Members, who are members of the Convention, a clear and specific mandate detailing the expectations of the European Parliament and to give our fellow citizens clear evidence of our commitment to ensuring that their fundamental rights are properly respected by the institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of competence of the Committee on Petitions justifies its interest in the framing of the charter. The large numbers of petitions which it receives make it possible to assess the citizens’ perception of the Union and the rights they expect it to protect. The opinion of the Committee on Petitions is intended to bring to light the aspirations expressed by the Europeans who refer their cases to Parliament in matters of non-observance of rights granted by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The petitioners who write to us display a stubborn and unfailing conviction that they are entitled to a whole series of rights, thereby giving the impression that the European citizen is convinced that the Union actually already has a formal constitution wherein all these rights are enshrined, thus anticipating the decisions of the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">So our opinion stresses two key points which the rapporteurs, moreover, seem to share. Firstly, the necessary visibility of the charter as a point of reference for the citizens. This necessitates clear and concise drafting within a single, comprehensible text.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the binding force of this charter, which is achieved when it is possible to defend the recognised rights in the law court. The natural outcome of this determination is the inclusion of the future charter among the Treaties. In conclusion, let me say that it is necessary to make a qualitative leap in the protection of fundamental rights. This report must be a unanimous message from Parliament to ensure that the Council and the Convention respond to the expectations of petitioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam President, we are holding this debate at exactly the right time. The convention which is drafting the Charter on Fundamental Rights has begun its work and I believe that we are already doing so at cruise speed. We are dealing with the content involving civil and political rights, and then we will deal with citizenship rights and economic and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important for this Parliament to establish a mandate for the members of the delegation representing it and also to establish – and this seems to me to be essential – which political objectives this Parliament will pursue by means of this Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The representative of the Committee on Petitions is right to point out that the citizens often ask us what this Charter of Fundamental Rights is for. Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions. The Member States of the European Union respect fundamental rights. There is a Rome Convention, upheld by the Court in Strasbourg, which is the ultimate guarantee in the event of a violation.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is this Charter for? I believe that Parliament should send a very clear message: the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a supplement to these rights guaranteed in the constitutions. Being European has an added positive effect. By means of this Charter we intend to bind the European institutions to a bill of fundamental rights and to bind the Member States to those same rights in their transposition and application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the political message which we must send. Being European is a positive thing. It adds to what we already have as national citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which we are debating today and voting on tomorrow also seems to explain very clearly what the political objectives of this Parliament are. We do not wish the Charter to be a mere declaration. We do not believe that a declaration is sufficient. We want the Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties precisely because we want the citizens to have more rights and guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not the Charter is incorporated into the Treaty clearly depends on the work which the convention is able to carry out. It will depend on whether the work is useful and can be incorporated into the Treaties. However, it seems to me essential that Parliament bears this objective in mind with regard to the drawing up of the Charter. It is also important to state, as this report does, that absolutely no harm will be done to the protection of fundamental rights as laid down in existing provisions. There will be no double use of the Convention of Strasbourg. We should make this very clear. I repeat that what we want is to provide the European citizens with a supplementary guarantee when it comes to the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, by affirming the indivisibility of fundamental rights, as this resolution does, or affirming their innovative nature, we are taking positive steps towards an improvement in the living conditions of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to end by whole-heartedly congratulating both the rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions. It is a matter of form in this Parliament to congratulate them, but I would like to do so from a political point of view and on behalf of my Group, because I believe that Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber, and all the draftsmen of opinions, have been able to provide the political response required by Parliament at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope, Madam President, that tomorrow’s vote will support the rapporteurs’ good work with a massive vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the exercise we are involved in today comes just in time and, every day, current events remind us how urgent this European Union charter is. This is the background against which we are working.</p>
<p class="contents">A European Union charter: this clearly means that the charter is addressed to each and every one of our fellow citizens, admittedly, but also to persons resident in or visiting the Union. That is important to note. It is important at a time when the European Union is experiencing upheaval at its very centre. It is important, too, and we would like to see this mentioned in the text that we are to vote upon tomorrow, at a time when we are involved in enlarging the Union to include countries for which the respect of fundamental rights is a significant question. It is important, finally, at a time when we consider – and we should like to specify this in the text that we shall be voting upon tomorrow – that the Union has passed the stage of economic integration and has clearly undertaken a process of political and social integration. The charter must contribute to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is certainly not intended to give a binding mandate to our fellow Members, myself included, in the context of the convention, since we have already commenced work. It is intended, rather, to say what Parliament expects of the convention. To this end, I should like to stress two points.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, what do we expect to obtain from this exercise? Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, if the objective were to assemble a convention, original in form and composition, as we have today, in order merely to come up with an announcement of a text bearing the signatures of the presidents of the three institutions, then I think we would be on the wrong track. We want more than this. It is in this spirit that we are working within the convention, both in terms of the timetable and the form.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is to do with its content. Our resolution does not say much with regard to content, but Parliament has already had, on at least three occasions, the opportunity to state what it expected from a charter on fundamental rights. This was not the purpose of today’s discussion, but it is worth highlighting three points. Firstly, if we have put together such a unique body only to codify the existing law to the letter, then I believe it was not worth planning this new body. Secondly, if the convention must confine itself to regurgitating all or part of the European Convention on Human Rights in order to void the question of whether or not the Union should adhere to it of all meaning, then I believe once again that we would be on the wrong track. Thirdly, it seems to me that, with regard to the content, we have here the opportunity to restate, at Union level, a number of commitments that each Member State endorses, but which we must confirm on behalf of the European Union as such, recognising a number of rights, particularly in the economic and social sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me state here the extent of the difficulty of the mandate given us at Cologne, acknowledging social rights which would be nothing more than goals. But, these specifically are the issues involved in the work which will be carried out within the convention and, on behalf of my Group, I wish to state the importance we shall accord the charter’s content in terms of such questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, I fully support the proposal which Ieke van den Burg has just made: if the Union is questioning its adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, then it must also question its adherence to the European Social Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the European Parliament will be on the right track for the charter to be ready, in terms of both content and timetable, to be integrated during the French Presidency. It would enable fundamental rights to be recognised in due form, and given the place they deserve in our internal legal system, a system which today is observed with a great deal of attention by citizens within the European Union, certainly, but also by the countries who wish to join the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fundamental rights are of secondary importance in treaties these days. If they are included at all, this is done so in a completely chaotic format. This is unacceptable, certainly if Europe professes to be a Community of values. Therefore the charter must guarantee the citizen protection against the breaches of increasingly widening supra-national legislation. The ECHR should apply as a minimum standard with specific European Union rights added to it. Needless to say, we need to do everything possible to leave national constitutions intact as much as possible but it cannot be ruled out that it will affect these constitutions. After all, the charter must be able to form the basis for new fundamental rights if so necessitated by social developments. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, it is essential for the European Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, for Strasbourg must become stronger, not weaker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must provide ourselves with the means to make it the founding element of European identity, allowing Europe to make the qualitative leap it needs in order to feel that it really does exist. In this context, I should like to join my fellow Members in pointing out the need to ensure that this charter is of a binding nature, for the citizens would find it hard to understand the European Union working on defining fundamental rights if it was not then possible to guarantee them in law. Fundamental rights, and let me stress this word, fundamental rights can be no less than mandatory. If they are not, then the whole construction of Europe would lose its fundamental nature in the opinion of many people. The future charter must be included among the Treaties and this must be achieved on the occasion of the next IGC, probably the last with the current fifteen countries. France, the self-proclaimed home of human rights, must absolutely take advantage of its presidency during the second half of 2000 in order to table this amendment of the Treaties. This is a formal request which we are making to the French Government.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two points that I would like to mention here. Firstly, I should like to stress the need for the charter to develop the concept of European citizenship due to residence. More than ever, it is essential to avoid the coexistence in Europe of distinct classes of people enjoying distinct rights. For example, how acceptable is it that an Algerian who has worked and paid taxes in France for thirty years may not vote in local elections whilst a European resident for six months in another European country can take part? This charter must make every effort to develop our definition of European citizenship based on the idea of residence. The rights that we are defining, if they are to be fundamental, must be applicable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to stress the urgent need to include effective protection for personal data held on computer within the scope of the charter. Last month, the European Parliament in fact adopted an amendment asking for a Committee on Information Technology and European Liberties to be set up. Well, this cannot truly exist unless it is based on a solid legal standard. The charter must therefore ensure that it defines the limits of the content of files, the means permitted for data retrieval, and access methods. Moreover, at a time when certain communication systems, certain spying systems, are prohibited, we must guarantee citizens’ rights with regard to the new European bodies which are being developed, and guarantee the rights of the citizen by means of parliamentary monitoring, but also consumer rights with regard to the new Internet marketing techniques. This is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twenty-first century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As integration has marched on, it has become apparent that, increasingly, we are falling short in our efforts to protect fundamental rights. This has its origins in the fact that increasingly, the individual Member States have been transferring sovereignty rights and competences to the Union, yet the protection of the fundamental rights of citizens of the Union is still only dealt with at national level. It is high time that we tackled these shortcomings in the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents a great opportunity for Europe. Why? Firstly, because after many years we are at last getting down to a project that many committed citizens, non-governmental organisations, and various political forces, not to mention this House, have long been calling for. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it will enable us to boost the public image of European integration for two reasons; the first being that it will enable us to strengthen democracy, and the second being that by establishing rights for those who live in the Union, we will at last be able to make this Europe visible and comprehensible to each and every individual in a very concrete way.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is extremely important to my mind. We have all experienced only too often just how little people comprehend what goes on in this remote and illusory place called Brussels, and how much disapproval there is. Time and again, people ask, and rightly so, what is this Europe actually all about? What purpose does it serve? What do I personally get out of it? If what we want is for the citizens to say: “Yes, I have a stake in this European project too”, then the Charter of Fundamental Rights can help to bring this about.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What will this Charter have to deliver, for us to be able to make full use of this opportunity? I would like to make five points in this connection. Firstly: in terms of standards, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must not fall behind the fundamental rights in existence in our countries, as it must not fall behind those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, it must be viable for the twenty-first century and take account of the new developments in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is only natural that the Charter should encompass all the policies of the Union; Community law as well as the second and third pillars, and, as such, make it incumbent on all bodies and institutions to preserve fundamental rights in the course of their decision-making and in the development and implementation of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and I cannot do other than support Mrs Boumediene-Thiery from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this – the Charter of Fundamental Rights must establish rights for all those who live in the Union, and not, for example, create first and second-class rights for first and second-class citizens respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I support the demand raised in the report for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be made legally binding and an integral part of the EU Treaty. In my view, the onus is on the Council to consider and revise its position on this. If the Charter did not form part of the Treaty, it would not be legally enforceable for each and every individual, and this would understandably only meet with disappointment and a lack of comprehension on the part of the people, who would say “ all they have done in Brussels is describe a piece of paper”.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it is especially important to us as a group that the social fundamental rights should not fall by the wayside or only be taken account of half-heartedly. I would like to emphasise my support for Mrs van den Burg on this point. The right to work, to have somewhere to live, to health, and the right to form trade unions and to strike are inalienable. We already have some concerns in this respect, particularly in view of the fact that practically all the amendments relating to this were rejected following the votes in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are firmly committed to seeing social rights become firmly established in law. We also hope that this Parliament will set down a clear political marker in this matter during tomorrow’s vote in plenary sitting. On a final note, I would just like to add that we cannot declare at a special summit meeting in Lisbon that full employment should be our political goal, but at the same time, refuse to incorporate social fundamental rights into the Charter. This contradiction is not politically defensible to my mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, my speech is going to be rather different to that of the previous speakers, since I should like to demonstrate that the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the Citizens of the European Union, as outlined in the European Parliament report by Duff and Voggenhuber, would in fact be a charter that restricted fundamental rights even more. This report in fact proposes including the citizens’ rights which have until now been determined at national level in a standard, detailed and binding European charter, whose application would be monitored and hence interpreted by the European Court of Justice. </p>
<p class="contents">I should point out, before going on, that I am not sure that all the other participants representing the Heads of State or Government and the national parliaments within the body established by the Cologne Council to prepare a preliminary draft charter are in fact in agreement with this position of the European Parliament. So, for the time being, what I am about to say applies only to the Duff/Voggenhuber report. </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, as far as those who promote the charter are concerned, defending fundamental rights which are already adequately protected in Europe at present, whatever they may say, is nothing but a pretext to conceal another, purely ideological, objective, which is to establish the beginnings of a European constitution, the crowning achievement of a superstate, even though the majority of the peoples of Europe do not want either of these. And how right they are, for this detailed, mandatory charter, which would give standardised definitions of citizens’ rights for the whole of Europe, would impose a rigid legal framework enclosing each nation in regulations which were not entirely its own. </p>
<p class="contents">There are three reasons for our claiming that the charter, as envisaged, would curtail the rights of citizens. Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined. It would weaken the control that they currently have over it. It would end in a situation where a nation could no longer amend the rights of its own citizens without obtaining the agreement of fourteen other nations, a suffocating formula, ill-suited to the nature and the interests of Europe, as I explained in the minority opinion appended to the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens’ rights in Europe. Indeed I am astounded that governments are prepared to allow this to happen. Have they not learnt the lessons of the past? Do they really wish, taking the example of the French Government, to have to face twenty problems such as the case of the hunters all at the same time?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this charter would tend to circumvent the rights of communities, primarily the national community, which are rights that are extremely dear to the citizens, since it is within this circle that the most realistic and most legitimate democracy is expressed. Here we are at the heart of what we have called the process of reducing rights. This process would, moreover, go much farther than one might think, for a whole series of beggars and minorities have started to come out of the woodwork, clearly understanding that if the charter is standardised and binding, as well as adopted under the dubious conditions of so-called European democracy, it may in years to come represent the weak link in the chain of democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group therefore considers that the charter, if it must exist, should be extremely brief and should present only the essential values, the fundamental principles of the countries of Europe, in the form of a political declaration. It is perfectly feasible to imagine, as of the end of the year, candidate countries signing up to this charter in order to demonstrate their inclusion in the circle of European values. If so, adhesion to the charter could be shared by both existing members and future members. </p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain, Madam President, at all costs we must avoid foisting a standardised and binding text on the nations of Europe, lest we create the post-national society which Mr Duff has just been hoping and praying for. This would be perceived as an attack on national democracies’ freedom of choice. Every country must continue to be able to choose its regulations freely in accordance with its own culture and development. We would like the Intergovernmental Conference, which is just starting, to keep the essential principle of respect for national democracies continually in mind.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I like to remember that, right here, in France, a couple of centuries ago, the first moves were made to define these rights, and only in North America, during the same period, were these rights actually given expression, apart from in the works of philosophers and academics, in legal documents such as the State Constitutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Now then, the European Union does, in effect, seem to be a little behind, but we can make up time by using this vessel. I am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework. We do not, as yet, know what we will put inside it. The report does, of course, contain some of the main points, but we will have to decide upon the definitive text later on. This Charter is important because, although we do have other conventions and treaties, human rights are always under threat, even within the Union. For example, I am thinking of the attempt to eliminate or cut down on the appeal procedures in lawsuits in Italy. I am thinking of the right to free elections which loses its meaning when, for example, the citizens of a country of the Union vote in a certain way, and vote freely, and then see their country penalised as a result of the outcome of the elections. The right of citizens to vote for whomsoever they choose should be respected indiscriminately for all people at all times, without sabotaging the governments and countries which emerge as a result of these elections. </p>
<p class="contents">Then there is not just the question of citizens’ rights: the rights of communities need to be better defined, as do the rights of peoples, those peoples which are under threat, on the one hand, from globalisation, which wants to standardise everything, and, on the other hand, from a return to a single, centralist, oppressive nation-state. In our opinion, however, we should be moving towards a Europe of peoples, peoples whose identity is not necessarily defined according to the present form of the Member States. In particular, certain rules of some of the penal codes should be altered, such as article 141 of the Italian Penal Code, which goes so far as to punish acts of secession with life imprisonment. I am not necessarily advocating secession, but I am claiming the right for anyone who might want to do so to be able to take action, in a peaceful and non-violent manner, of course, to uphold and apply this right which is sanctioned by the UN Charter, sanctioned by the Helsinki Final Act and, I hope, despite certain penal rules, will also be sanctioned by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot change this by giving citizens a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Citizens need to see that the European institutions are actually acting in their interests and are not just out to increasing their own power. If this happens, confidence among people will grow more than could ever be achieved by many a fine declaration or charter.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not share the presumption that a comprehensive charter can be drafted which comprises all current fundamental rights. Such a document cannot be drafted, not now or in future, and this ambition is certainly not a task of the European Union. What we should aim for within the Union is cooperation based on respect for the separate identities of peoples and states. </p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental rights must be secured where they can be protected as effectively as possible and where they can be embedded in the social fabric, that is to say within the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that the ECHR’s external supervisory role in the protection of fundamental rights remains intact. Equally, the authority of the Court in Strasbourg over this whole procedure should remain unaffected. A legally binding charter will inevitably affect fundamental rights provisions in Member States and will undermine the role and the authority of the ECHR and the Court in Strasbourg. </p>
<p class="contents">If a charter were to be drafted nonetheless, we would strongly urge that this only apply to the institutions of the Union. It should only include articles which can give a meaningful message to these European institutions. Vague instruction standards or rights in policy areas, where the Union has no authority, must be omitted. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, fundamental rights are based on human dignity. The true value of human life, however, will never be fully understood if we lose sight of God, the Creator of all things, including man. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up this Charter, the Union wishes to demonstrate its respect for the rights of the people and to show that it cares about the welfare of the individual. At the same time, however, the impression has been created in the public arena that the European Union does not even respect the fundamental right – as it were – of an individual State to form a government with sovereign power. Likewise, the impression has been created that 14 Member States have failed to play by the rules they themselves adopted, and have violated their obligations towards solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you this: how is a Union of the Member States that adopts sanctions out of prejudice, without giving the parties concerned a fair hearing and with no legal basis, to satisfy people that it intends to do more than just pay lip-service to fundamental rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The decision taken by the 14 has done great damage to the perception that the citizens of the European Union have of Europe. And I believe it is very doubtful indeed as to whether this damage can be made good by a Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The request was made at the time of the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Amsterdam. In this connection, I would also remind you of the report which I had the privilege of writing in conjunction with Mrs Dury in preparation for the Treaty of Amsterdam. This question was raised in that document too. In fact, it was in this document that we achieved our first successes, for our anti-discrimination clause was used in the Treaty of Amsterdam virtually verbatim. Later on, at the Cologne Summit, Parliament’s wider request was also honoured. A meeting was proposed for the purpose of producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen. The question which concerns us today, more than anything is: what should this charter contain and what legal force should it have? As far as the latter is concerned, I would like to express my unequivocal support in favour of including a charter in the treaties and in favour of a charter which can be enforced on behalf of citizens upon the European courts. We should not produce empty shells; our citizens would see through them straight away anyway. As far as the content is concerned, the charter must tie in with the existing conventions, such as the Council of Europe’s European Convention for the protection of human rights. In fact, in my opinion, the Union should sign up to that Convention without delay. The charter should at least deal with the citizens’ fundamental rights, the political rights, the social rights and, in my opinion, the rights of minorities too, and it should form a supplement to what we already have. It should not duplicate what is already there. New threats, in particular, will need to be anticipated, such as in the field of information and biotechnology, and in the protection of the environment, of which man forms part. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the rights of minorities appear to constitute one of the most difficult areas in the charter and because this has been and will be one of Europe’s key problems, I would argue in favour of including fundamental rights of minorities in the charter. I will probably submit a text on this matter myself. But the most important fact, Mr President, is that the charter will be given legal force, that it will be included in the Treaty and that our citizens will be reassured that the European Union will take its fundamental rights seriously too, and will want to defend them up to the highest level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament declared itself fully in favour of this move, convinced that this is the way to guarantee the legal status of the Charter and to consolidate the protection of rights at a legal level as well, awarding jurisdiction to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The governments, and, on their behalf, the Council of Cologne, left the question open. They left a question mark over whether and how to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties. We feel that the Intergovernmental Conference is our opportunity to resolve this question, and this opportunity must not be passed up. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, so to speak, two parallel operations. It is the responsibility of the Convention to prepare the draft Charter in time for the Intergovernmental Conference to be able to decide whether to incorporate it into the Treaties. In this regard, I would like to warn the representative of the Council, the Portuguese Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the Intergovernmental Conference should already be starting to prepare for this eventuality. If the Charter is ready in time, the Intergovernmental Conference will have to define the procedures for its incorporation into the Treaty. As we are all aware, from the European Parliament’s perspective, this should represent a step towards the constitutionalisation of the Union. I am quite aware that the term ‘constitutionalisation’ has come to be viewed with some suspicion recently, and that people are afraid to use it, or at least, prefer to avoid using it. From time to time I find myself in difficulties, because the parliamentary committee of which I am Chairman has changed its name from the ‘Committee on Institutional Affairs’ to the ‘Committee on Constitutional Affairs’. And yet I feel that this is the right way for us to go and that it does not in any way mean promoting that concept we all fear of a European superstate. Nothing can undermine the value of the national constitutions, in the same way that, according to the Treaties, European citizenship does not replace national citizenship, but incorporates it. </p>
<p class="contents">The governments did something very courageous when they gave the go-ahead for the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Cologne, and now they should not have any regrets. They should not turn back, but should exploit their decision to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, human rights are a constitutional issue. The incorporation of the Charter of Rights into the Treaties is the logical result of the decision taken in Cologne, which was taken for the benefit of the citizens, that they might have a part in the construction of Europe and fully identify with the plans for the Union, its principles, its values and its institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, when you think of it, odd to suppose that great institutions of this kind could be thought capable of existing without some constitution. Manifestly we do exist and therefore manifestly we already have some kind of a constitution. The question is: do we have an adequate constitution and what kind of constitution do we want? To say we need a constitution is not to say that the European Union should have the constitution of a state, for the Union is not a state and is not about to become one. We all therefore agree that there should be proper recognition of rights within the Union and that this should be binding on the organs and institutions of the Union. The EU organs and institutions can exercise far too much power to permit them that power without the proper control which a Charter of Rights would imply.</p>
<p class="contents">There is however one risk. One of the great success stories of Europe is the way in which the European Court of Justice, especially when other institutions were blocked, succeeded in building the concept of Europe as a Community under the law.</p>
<p class="contents">If we create a Charter of Rights that overloads the Court of Justice, that has everybody beating a path every week to Luxembourg, we will destroy the purpose. We must ensure that the main avenue for protecting rights is in the national courts and in a supervisory jurisdiction as exercised at European level. If we do not succeed in that, we will fail in everything.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that way, a loophole has appeared in connection with fundamental rights, and this loophole should, of course, be closed. In our eagerness to make things right, we are, however, in danger of doing a lot of damage. The EU is faced with a number of choices. Are we to secure our own rights? Are we exclusively to look after ourselves and our own? Or are we to reinforce human rights throughout Europe? The EU must not start competing with the existing authorities for resolving disputes, such as the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg. That would, of course, weaken the latter and damage the situation regarding human rights throughout Europe. In my view, the EU’s Court of Justice should therefore be kept away from the project concerning fundamental rights. Instead, the EU ought to take Strasbourg’s judgements seriously and demand that present and future Member States ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, the ILO conventions and the essential UN conventions, as well as having economic and tariff agreements depend upon the parties adhering to these conventions. In that way, the EU would reinforce the existing conventions, and that is something there is a need for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, they have been given an impossible task to try and square a circle that cannot be squared.</p>
<p class="contents">In the brief time that I have, I would like to concentrate on one specific point which the previous speaker has mentioned, as indeed have other speakers. That is the potential conflict which could arise between this Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights. Let us not forget that each Member State has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, has incorporated it into its own national law and is bound by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Over the last 50 years, the European Convention, with the decisions of the Court, has grown and evolved to accommodate new rights, new entitlements and new freedoms that have developed with society.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in case Members do not know it, under a strict legal interpretation any EU legislation supersedes any constitutional provision or any other national legislative provision in any one of the Member States. Therefore, if this Charter were to be incorporated into the Treaties, it would supersede the European Convention on Human Rights, it would supersede any national constitutional provisions and would also supersede any national legislative provisions. Therefore, whilst it is important that each of us must stand up for the inalienable freedoms and rights enjoyed by each individual citizen, as well as by groups of citizens, I think there is a better way to deal with this problem than through a Charter, namely through the incorporation of the Convention into European Union law and its enforcement at national Member State level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, you refute the transcendental and the sublime because you confuse moralism with morality – indeed, Goethe, as you know, said that moralism was the opposite of morality – and legalism with law.</p>
<p class="contents">Please understand that we are not challenging the existence of human rights. We are saying that they should be taken into consideration among other rights, and that it is all of these rights which must contribute to the general interest, for it is general interest that is the primordial rule of political action, not the zeitgeist, the showbiz society, the mediagoguery, or weakness raised up as a system. Indeed, human rights are no more than an object, a pretext, which the speakers here – like the pseudo-artist Duchamp – generally make a mockery of.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pretext, when the very title of the proposed charter speaks of the fundamental rights ‘of’ the European Union instead of fundamental rights ‘within’ the European Union. What you are trying to create is a precursor for a constitution that is impossible to find because in fact you have reached a dead end and you know perfectly well that the construction of Europe has turned into an unbelievable preachifying mass of texts and declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgetting the people, social democrats hide, shamefaced, behind human rights and furtive liberals turn into social democrats. But the people take note of these recantations and will, one day, reject them, or indeed the Western world will come to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It certainly is not useful, as has been claimed previously, in terms of improving or strengthening human rights within the construction of Europe. No, and we should pay tribute to Mrs Berès for having just now clearly given direction to a debate which marks a key turning point in the history of the construction of Europe, the transition from an economic and commercial Europe to a political and institutional Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Charter of Human Rights is the first step in this direction, but, as with everything which characterises the construction of Europe, the approach is indirect, concealed, tortuous and, I might even say, ‘Jesuitical’. The question of a constitution and its contents is not asked, but instead the question of a charter of human rights which is obviously the precursor for a constitution, it being understood that the precursor will eventually give rise to a constitution proper and then, possible, to a State. The interesting thing about this approach – and here again I must pay tribute to Mrs Berès for her clear-sightedness and honesty, even if, as she knows, I totally disagree with her conclusions – is that it tends to determine what will be the principles of the European communities, or of the community of human beings living within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mrs Berès speaks of the rights being applied not only to citizens but also to visiting and resident aliens, she is tackling a matter which, I feel, is probably going to be developed in the texts already submitted and to be submitted in future to this House, to wit, what will be the basis of the rights which will govern the European Union? Is it to be citizenship in the way that we traditionally understand it, with rights which characterise in a specific way the people belonging to a given community? Or is it to be rights extended to parties other than citizens proper, with a shift, or at least the start of a shift, from democracy based on citizenship towards democracy based on the equal treatment of individuals resident, whether long-term residents or visitors, on European Union territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this is a problem which as yet we can only see the premises of, but, in my view, it is absolutely essential to see the premises in order to be able subsequently to follow the thread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The nations of Europe can be proud of their record on human rights; however, have they needed charters? Britain led the world in the battle to abolish slavery, but the only Charter – actually so called – which we have ever had in Britain was signed at Runnymede by King John in 1215. Of course, there are exceptions, exceptions so serious that Europe has a responsibility to do what it can to ensure that the inhumanities and atrocities of the past are never repeated. But does this Charter add to what we already have? Does it add to or replace the Convention on Human Rights to which all EU Member States and applicant states are signatories, or does it just add another judicial forum, leaving lawyers with the happy and profitable choice between the European Court and the Court of Human Rights?</p>
<p class="contents">Why not a simple declaration of human rights under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty without the need for a charter for litigation? Can fundamental rights properly be protected by a court which is already overstretched and frequently arrives at its judgments long after the events which it is judging? Does this Charter simply aim to be an expensive distributor of compensation in the dreadful fullness of time?</p>

It clearly is not, as Mr Berthu has said, in order to create a European super-state but more, as Mrs Berès has said, to make it clear to today's citizens and tomorrow's citizens that what we are in now is a Community of values: values based on democracy, freedom, equality, solidarity and respect for diversity, values – and I stress this to Mrs Garaud – that unite Europeans across frontiers, from the north, the south, the east and the west of the Community. The big question is not whether we need such a Charter but what status it should have. Some have argued that the Charter should simply gather together in a readable form all the rights that currently exist within the European Union. This would be a valuable exercise: there is clearly a problem of awareness of people's rights. Many citizens do not know the rights that exist today. A document clearly laying out such rights, and making it clear where and how these rights could be exercised, would be valuable. But if that was all we were doing in the Convention then we should have left it to a team of academics, who frankly could have done it better than a group of 60 politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have a team of 60 politicians working on the Convention because it is our duty to identify gaps in existing rights, to identify weaknesses in existing structures and to show the political will to correct those weaknesses. So the Charter must fill in any gaps in existing rights, and it must be binding on the institutions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear that not all rights will be equal, at least in the way they are implemented. The rights need to be in two categories. There needs to be a list of rights which will be directly upheld by the courts, but there also needs to be another list of general rights which the Community institutions and others will have to take into account when drafting policies; some in the Court, some simply as background forming a valuable basis when we are taking other decisions. What is clear, and what unites most people in this Chamber who want such a Charter, is that it must be in the Treaties. If it is to impact on the citizen it must appear in the Treaties of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this position will be retained in tomorrow’s sitting, as it will be vitally important if we wish to avoid confusion with the many various schemes in respect of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise the issue of reinforcing the political rights of citizens with the help of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In my view, there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject. If, however, we were to examine what a citizen of the European Union today can actually do, how much he or she can influence the decision-making process, we would see that there are not so many opportunities to do so. Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country. But why should we not establish some new institutions and instruments, by means of this Charter, enabling citizens to have a real influence? Why, for example, could we not take up the notion that a certain number of citizens – let us say from three different EU countries – could formulate a citizens’ initiative that then could be channelled though the European Parliament? Why can we not look to the future and see that it will be ever more important for our citizens to be able to take part directly in decision-making in other ways too? I think it would be natural for this to form part of the Charter and very little has been said about this so far.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The working masses fought, and achieved and consolidated positive results which protected their rights, and which, at the same time, played a decisive role in the development of democracy. It is a bitter surprise to find that there is no specific, explicit reference in this document to those social rights which are, in actual fact, the most important part of the immense democratic process which became established in Europe during the course of the century. I am referring to essential rights, without which democracy is not true democracy: freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of association and so on are the basic framework of democracy, but within that framework and from that framework must emerge a healthy, solid structure which is a perfect combination of freedom and justice. First and foremost, a document such as this cannot fail to include a specific, indisputable reference to the right to work. It cannot and must not be without this reference. Yes, social rights are mentioned, but they should be clearly and practically defined: the right to work, the right to health, the right to education, the right to housing, to a pension, the right, that is, to life, to a life where all have equal opportunities, according to those principles of <span class="italic">liberté</span> [freedom] and <span class="italic">égalité</span> [equality] which have played such a major part in our extensive history.

For this reason, we are against it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not questioning the content of such a charter. We come from a country whose constitution contains one of the most extensive enumerations of fundamental rights anywhere. We also belong to a party that was forged in the struggle for democracy, and one of whose greatest concerns has always been the steadfast promotion of human rights. We oppose the charter, however, because in the idea behind it, we detect a kind of Trojan horse for federalism, a political trap which would entail other serious political and legal consequences for the Member States and peoples of Europe. We do not think that it would be correct, and certainly not appropriate, to impair and disturb the balance of the Treaties at present. On the contrary, the times and challenges we are currently facing mean that it is more important than ever to promote the Treaties and follow the precise, secure routes mapped out by the founding fathers which have brought us this far. There is a very simple reason why the European Union does not need a Charter of Fundamental Rights: it does not have a fundamental rights problem. The Europe to which we belong is even, to a certain extent, the cradle of the culture of fundamental rights. As there is no problem, the charter is not a solution and as the charter will solve nothing, it is therefore a problem in itself. Firstly, because it would divide us in a cause in which we should be united. Secondly, because it would give rise to an overlapping and potentially disruptive conflict with the protection afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights, under the tried and tested institutional framework of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights. This is not a plus, but a minus.</p>
<p class="contents">The appropriate setting in which to enshrine fundamental rights is the constitutional law of each nation state. The appropriate setting for achieving international legal harmonisation and solid advances in the international protection of human rights is the agreements and conventions ratified by the Member States in as wide a geographical area as possible. In other words, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, in Europe, the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work within these extensive international frameworks if we are really to make the protection of rights already recognised by Member States more effective internationally, instead of following a route that will restrict us because it runs counter to the main feature of the culture of fundamental rights: its universality.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU really does want to take symbolic steps in this field, it needs to go down a different path. That would involve including all human rights agreements and conventions already ratified by the 15 Member States in the list of international texts referred to in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. This would ensure that they were clearly incorporated into the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. That would be a real step forward. This charter is the wrong answer to a problem that does not even exist and is therefore an additional problem which we feel we can do without. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider it to be great progress that the European Parliament has specified and established a view of human beings which is deeply rooted in Europe’s history, culture, popular movements and spiritual traditions. I am therefore pleased that my amendment concerning human dignity – unique to each person, yet common to all and inviolable – obtained support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for we must establish a common view of human beings as the effective basis for the EU’s urgent, global fight against the death penalty, its struggle on the side of life and also its fight against torture, against the sex trade and against sexual exploitation. In our capacity as citizens, we have freedoms and rights, but we also have responsibilities. I therefore welcome the fact that responsibilities have been incorporated in accordance with my wording in Item E.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you of Amendments Nos 24 and 25 which the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats have submitted and which will be voted on tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I want to discuss the fact that, in November 1999, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the European Parliament made a statement to the effect that the family does not have any special rights but only individual rights.

However, the report by Duff and Voggenhuber has given us cause for this today. I would particularly like to take this opportunity to highlight how doggedly they have pursued their goal. All too often one has the feeling in this House, that notwithstanding all verbal declarations, the superior might and advantages enjoyed by the Council and the Commission prevail, and all too often, this is where the interests of national parties and governments win through as well. Duff and Voggenhuber, on the other hand, think of themselves as true European Parliamentarians whose task it is to further the interests of Europe as a whole. And so tomorrow, we will be able to adopt a report, which is based on the premise that naturally the European Parliament, and not the national governments, would be responsible for instituting the fundamental rights of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">This Charter will only meet the needs of the citizens of Europe under two provisos. Firstly, it must be given substance, and secondly, it must be made binding in law. However, it is stunningly disappointing to note how the Convention, which has been specifically set up for this purpose, is high on competences but very low in courage. And so really, this report could also be viewed as an appeal to the Convention that goes like this: ‘Dare to <span class="italic">do </span>something at long last! Dare to include innovations in the Charter, particularly those in the sphere of information and biotechnology, but also where equal rights for women and environmental protection are concerned. Dare to do more than just spend time in the glass palace of Parliament talking about the people of Europe – get out there and involve them! And dare to adopt the standards on international labour law set by the International Labour Organisation.’</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is precisely the instrument we need to give Europe a soul, and it could help create a common identity. Why is it that EU governments are so quick off the mark when it comes to pushing through economic reforms but so hesitant when it comes to political rights? Do you not realise that Europe as we know it will fall apart if we put all our efforts into bringing on the economy and do not do anything to promote political fundamental rights? Conscious of my position as an Austrian, I would therefore like to make the following appeal to the national governments: ‘wake up, it is in your own interests to give fundamental rights a chance! With this in mind, I hope the report in question achieves an overwhelming majority in plenary tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first trap is that it may just become just another public relations exercise – and we have seen many of them from the European Union, in employment for instance – which has no legal basis, which is not binding and which will therefore not allow citizens to enforce their rights through the courts. </p>
<p class="contents">The second danger is that it may give the European Union an excuse to continue not being legally bound by basic decisions or regulations of international bodies, such as the European Convention on Human Rights or the various decisions of the International Labour Organisation. </p>
<p class="contents">The third danger is that it may become a general Charter containing a loose set of average values, a mechanism for subverting the advanced human rights which have been acquired in various countries. For example, if a particular country has the right to free education, then any general reference to the right to education in a European Union Charter could be the first step towards subverting that right. </p>
<p class="contents">Provided the Charter deals with these three traps, provided it addresses social rights in a serious manner, provided it is open to the new issues raised by the Internet, new technologies, etc., and provided it applies to all persons living in Europe, then it may represent a positive contribution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fundamental rights of the modern age have their origins in the Magna Carta Libertatum of 1215, the Petition of Rights of 1628, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and, lastly, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen during the French Revolution. The fact that fundamental rights have come to be guaranteed under constitutional law over the past 200 years is largely down to the impact these universal documents of fundamental rights have had.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now the task of twenty-first century Europe to combine the existing fundamental rights in the Member States and those aspects that apply to Europe. The fundamental rights such as freedom of worship, freedom to meet and form associations, for example, are sacrosanct and inalienable rights to freedom from state intervention. Applied to Europe this means that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights must protect the citizens of the European Union against the interference and intervention of European institutions in the fundamental rights of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, our group hopes that a written European catalogue of fundamental rights will put European integration on a firmer legal-ethical footing and help to create greater transparency and clarity for the citizens. Our group deems it particularly important that the European Charter should neither replace nor infringe Member States’ own provisions on fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been heated discussion over the call for the European Union to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms drawn up by the Council of Europe in 1950. The Council of Europe’s Convention is now 50 years old. Our group opposes the Union’s signing up to the Convention, not just because the existing European treaties do not permit this but, in particular, because we need our own catalogue of fundamental rights for the European Union, that is, one that reflects the convictions and beliefs we hold today. At the same time, however, this means that we must confine ourselves to the traditional fundamental rights and avoid extending the scope to social and economic fundamental rights, which are not legally enforceable at European level. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the comprehensive work they have done, and hope that the deliberations of the European Parliament find their way into the Convention’s discussions on the elaboration of fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report itself is sound because it conveys the key messages without going so far as to anticipate the work of the fundamental rights convention. I therefore nurture the hope that tomorrow in plenary sitting, this report will be adopted in the form we in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights drafted it in. However there is one point which I would like to be amended. I have tabled an amendment to this effect on behalf of my group. It concerns the question, raised repeatedly today, as to whether the European Union should sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights. This was an important goal in the past. It was an important and appropriate goal in the past precisely because there was no intention, at that stage, to create our own, autonomous catalogue of fundamental rights at European Union level; viewed in this light, it was far better to have that, as a second-best solution, than nothing at all.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is not the path we want Europe to go down in the future, and nor should it. With all due respect for the Human Rights Convention, we need more! We need our own Charter that provides our own answers to the questions raised by the age we live in. It must balance traditional, liberal rights with an adequate set of economic rights as well as offer effective solutions to issues pertaining to the social rights of citizens of the European Union and to the need to guarantee them a basic standard of social protection.. The European Convention on Human Rights does not fulfil this task. It is not in a position to do so because it came into being in the 50s, when political and social conditions were completely different. Seen in this light, it is time for all of us to call for constructive work to commence on our own Charter. We call upon the Convention on Fundamental Rights, the 62 politicians that David Martin mentioned, to take up this task. Let us support them in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the lawful object of the Charter of Rights is to protect the legitimate rights, expectations and aspirations of the citizen against the oppressive behaviour of government, business or other citizens; and it is, of course, right that people should be thus safeguarded in respect of the European institutions and their activities. However, having said that, the crucial matter is not the existence of a Charter but the proper safeguarding of the citizen, and the means by which the citizen achieves such protection today vary from Member State to Member State. In view of the Community’s normal legislative practice, I am somewhat surprised that it was not felt that this should be achieved by going with the grain of the established legal and administrative mechanisms of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, policy should be implemented along the lines of a directive rather than a regulation. For example, I was speaking recently with some very senior judges in Germany who were clear, on the basis of the history and traditions of their country, that these matters should be contained in a justiciable charter. But my own country has a very different tradition in this respect, as our own Prime Minister has made clear, and it is not part of the United Kingdom’s tradition to safeguard the citizen in this way. We do it differently and no less effectively. I think it is very relevant that the present socialist United Kingdom government is committed to ensuring that the Charter is non-justiciable and does not extend beyond existing rights to those not currently contained in the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, for those countries which have a long tradition of directly, legally binding charters, a development of the kind proposed is not dramatic. But for those which do not, it is a very radical step; and in the meantime, I will keep a very close watch on the United Kingdom and what it may say and do about all this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Council of Europe’s Social Charter and the European Parliament’s resolution on the declaration fundamental rights and freedoms clearly conclude that there is a special need to protect the family. Unfortunately, not everyone sees the matter in this way, and, in my opinion, we can see an unnecessary conflict between the rights of women and those of families, which people try to accommodate by rejecting the family instead of seeking a radically new and egalitarian European policy on the family. This means that family values in society are falling into the wrong, or at least biased, hands. The new right is getting hold of them and using them to capture the moral high ground. That is why the theme is tiresome to so many. However, I believe that it would be a big mistake for the European Parliament to approve of this sort of trend. Families are firmly connected with the European notion of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many others, the Christian Democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility meet halfway. I see it as a family society because it is difficult to learn about joint responsibility and solidarity if it is not learnt in a small, close-knit community. Society may be just, but it cannot ever love. Its bosom is too cold and its arm too short. Nevertheless, it is this very love that is a requirement for the healthy development of the individual. And a progressive Charter of Fundamental Rights will be of no use to Europe if the members of its society have no wish to respect them. Social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family. </p>
<p class="contents">There can thus be no people’s Europe without a family-oriented Europe. Families need recognition, encouragement, freedom of action and protection from social tyranny just the same as individuals do. Family rights and protection that have been provided for in legislation elsewhere in this respect should be reproduced in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good to remember that Europe has shared a common position throughout its history regarding the importance of supporting and protecting family and marriage. This is enshrined in all our constitutions as well as the constitutions of those accession countries joining the European Union in enlargement. I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states in which the family and marriage is protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life. Part 1 of Article 9 states: "Everyone shall have the right to found a family". It says it is inspired by Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states "men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and found a family according to national laws". Society recognises marriage not on moral grounds but because it recognises on a rational basis the stability it affords society socially and economically as well as securing future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of best practice – and whilst it is increasingly difficult to define family and we need great sensitivity and compassion in this area – we should not throw away the traditional family unit as the fundamental unit we strive towards, indeed we should uphold it.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 3 of Article 9 states, "the Union shall ensure the protection of children". It suggests we could add "in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child". I support this, but I would strongly suggest that we incorporate into the wording of point 3 that first and foremost, the Union will support the family as the primary and natural educator and protector of the child as is their duty. The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty. As it states in the Convention, "the family as the fundamental group of society and natural environment for the growth and wellbeing of its members, particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance to fully assume its responsibility within the Community"<span class="italic">.</span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current presidency of the European Union believes that the plan to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is an extremely important step in creating a Community of values which will act as a focus for taking the process of political union further. Many people are wondering how far we can go in this process of establishing a standard set of values and principles in this way, which would guarantee every citizen within the Union a set of rights that would strengthen their sense of belonging to an area with a shared civilisation. A question that has already been asked here today is what makes us want to join together and to transcend our enormous diversity by creating an entity which will unite us all. This is the key question as regards European identity, and it goes to the very root of why we are also joined together here, in this great home – the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the decades, and having survived all kinds of traumas and crises, we have established a way of life based on the values of liberty, democracy and respect for the rule of law. For many years, a potential model based on the culture of freedom that we enjoyed in some countries in Europe was held up to those who lived in other parts of Europe. This culture is in fact part of a tradition of tolerance which has been cultivated in this continent and which now, in turn, is at the heart of the European project itself. The ascendancy of these ideas and the end of the totalitarian era which marked certain European societies has created a new situation to which we must respond. In our opinion, this is a question of responsibility and also of consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the European Union to cover new countries, which is an ethical imperative and an essential strategy for stability and peace in our continent, will unite us with states which have very diverse political cultures and which, in many cases, have young and untried institutions and structures. Both for these states and for those among them that are fighting for fundamental principles that will structure their contemporary societies, it is becoming important for these principles to be incorporated into a body of Community legislation to which they will remain linked after accession. Do not think, however, that this idea of a charter or a body of principles is merely a type of safeguard mechanism in the face of new Member States, that is to say a kind of defence against other countries. This is not the case, and that is not the purpose of all this.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have demonstrated that what we hold to be stable and permanent within our own countries, within the Community of Fifteen, may, in certain circumstances, turn out to be much less helpful than we might hope in terms of addressing problems that are often quite simple, but in other cases revive old ghosts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is nevertheless not intended to act as a substitute for the constitutional guarantees that we all enjoy in our own countries. We must dispose of this myth – which has been regularly used as a weapon to attack the Charter of Fundamental Rights – so that we can stop it being used as an excuse by those who seek refuge in subsidiarity in order not to shoulder their responsibilities as European citizens. No, we intend to provide something which will bring added value, a kind of additional guarantee, which would function as an instrument of the new European citizenship. Here, Mr President, we must overcome certain problems which the debate within the Convention is beginning to run into and which I think it will face even more frequently in the future. I would like to emphasise that in making these comments, I am speaking on behalf of the Council and not necessarily on behalf of my own country, which has adopted a rather, shall we say, ambitious position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue regards jurisdiction. It concerns the need to guarantee complete compatibility between the two relevant legal systems, which could find themselves in conflict with one another in this process. This is a real problem and one of which we should all be aware. We cannot run the risk that when this charter comes into force a new area of legal uncertainty will be created. We are embarking upon an exercise designed to make our citizens’ rights more transparent – not to ensnare them in a web of legal contradictions that could prove to be a source of confusion. This also brings us to the issue, which has surfaced once again following Amsterdam, of the Union possibly signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is how we define the people this Charter is designed to protect, in other words, are we talking about those citizens who have a Community nationality, or are we aiming at those people who happen to be living in the Community area? This is a fundamental question. We will have to accept the consequences whichever answer we opt for, and all the more so given that many of us genuinely feel that the institutions and the institutions alone are the real object of this new Charter. </p>
<p class="contents">The third question, and a crucial one, is the body of rights. How far do we intend to go? Are we to be content with a body of basic principles, a kind of lowest common denominator in academic European terms, or should reach out to more ambitious territory, and deal with the modern aspects of today’s European Union? It seems that today’s public is capable of calling for an area enshrined within the Union, and covering not just their economic and social rights but also the new rights that have been presented as part of modern citizenship. How far is the Union prepared to go?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my fourth question, which is perhaps the most important one. This is a debate in which some people are clearly advocating a text which is merely a declaration of intent, a piece of political rhetoric. But unless it is binding, will any Charter of Fundamental Rights be anything more than a mere statement of principles, without any real value? If we create a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is merely a declaration of intent, will we not simply be taking refuge behind an issue which may be politically correct, but which does not reflect to the essence of the European Union as it is today?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, things have moved on and we cannot ignore this. This presidency believes that this clearly justifies the in-depth work that is needed on a Charter of Fundamental Rights. What I mean, of course, is that with the Treaty of Amsterdam we launched an ambitious project to establish a greater European area of freedom, security and justice. At the Tampere Special European Council, the European Commission and the Member States initiated a process of improving the structures for internal security, in order to provide stability in the daily lives of the general public, by guaranteeing to effectively combat organised crime and drug trafficking and to address other public order issues. As part of this European effort, it is becoming essential to ensure that all of this action, that is any future action that we may take in this area, relates to a very clear body of principles, capable of providing the public with clear and transparent legal protection. This is also why we feel – and we said so in Cologne when the idea of a Charter of Fundamental Rights was approved at the European Council – that this Charter is a vital element, central to the Union’s future. Unless our principles are reinforced in this way, unless the Union provides itself with an ethical pillar which gives it credibility in the eyes of the general public – a pillar which, in fact can also serve as a model and a point of reference for its external relations – we run the risk of being derailed as a result of extending our policies and watering down our values.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I should like to mention the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference. It is obvious that the issue of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a crucial factor for the whole credibility of the ICG. From the outset, the Portuguese Presidency has made its attitude quite clear: it is important to ensure that the agenda of the IGC should not simply be a kind of discussion of the division and management of power in an enlarged Union. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is, in this context, and this is how we shall view it until the end of our Presidency, a vital element in producing a more balanced result at this conference, which will in fact also cover other issues, notably the issue of defence and security. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is for all of these reasons that the Council is taking a special interest in the resolution that this Parliament has just adopted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and will continue to attach the greatest importance to this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Union will accordingly accept its responsibilities towards the citizens of Europe, and will take a political initiative with a view to addressing the future political and moral legitimacy of the European Union itself. The goal just outlined both by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber and by the representative of the Council Presidency will require us to make every effort to ensure that work in the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concluded in time to be taken into consideration, both by the Intergovernmental Conference and by the Summit of Heads of State and Government at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to begin by emphasising the importance of the composition of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, because for the first time, representatives of the Community institutions and of national institutions, from both the legislative and executive branches, have been brought together in a single body established by the European Council. This composition, which I believe to be a wise choice, covering both the Community and national domains as it does, will help to strengthen the legitimacy of the draft charter in the eyes of the general public, as well as guaranteeing the success of the work currently being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the Commission would like to make four key points quite clear to Parliament. The first is that in broad terms, the Commission agrees with and shares the European Parliament’s objectives with regard to the legal force of the charter, as regards calling for it to be incorporated into the Treaties and as regards the full range of laws to be incorporated into the Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, I think that the report before us today also emphasises that there are questions to be addressed directly to the Convention, that is questions for those drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights. These include, for example, the issue of the list of rights to be included in the charter. But there are other issues which go beyond the Convention’s remit, and which are above all a matter for the Heads of State and Government meeting within the European Council, as well as for the Intergovernmental Conference itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the Commission, as stated in Paragraph 14 of the resolution tabled by the European Parliament, takes the view that the legal force of the charter should be determined by the Nice European Council. However, the Commission believes that the process of drafting the charter must yield a clear and concise text perfectly accessible to the European public, but which is also drafted in rigorous legal terms that can be accepted as legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Commission feels that the Union must sign the European Convention on Human Rights, and that this is not a decision that can be taken by the Convention working on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It must be taken by the European Council, when it decides on the legal force of the charter. The Commission advocated this as long ago as 1979 and did so again in 1990. The idea that the European Union itself ought to sign the European Convention is also largely shared by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in 1996 that the Community could not sign the European Convention on Human Rights, I must emphasise that it made such a ruling because there was no legal basis in the Treaties for the Community to do so. Now that we are revising the Treaties and at the same time a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being drafted, this is a good time to address both issues: a charter with legal force and a political decision for the Union to sign the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to clearly state a second idea. There is no inherent contradiction between the Union having a Charter of Fundamental Rights and, at the same time, signing the European Convention on Human Rights. Quite the contrary. I would like to remind you that an extremely large majority of the political groups in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe three weeks ago adopted a recommendation that not only recognised and applauded the European Union’s initiative to provide itself with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, but which also supported and looked favourably on the European Union actually signing the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I recommend that you carefully read the contribution of the observer representing the European Court of Human Rights in the Convention responsible for drafting the Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the statement by the Court of Human Rights itself, the Court’s representative expresses his support for the idea that the Union should have a Charter of Fundamental Rights and, secondly, that the Union should sign the European Convention on Human Rights. With regard to the issue of a conflict between the rulings of the Court in Strasbourg and rulings in Luxembourg, it is worth noting that today, under Community law, the Court of Justice of the European Communities always refers to the European Convention on Human Rights, to actual decisions by the European Court of Human Rights, as the source of inspiration for decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Communities on fundamental rights issues. This means that we are not talking about a revolution, but merely about enshrining in law what is today already practised in the Court of Justice of the European Communities in its relations with the European Convention on Human Rights itself and the Strasbourg Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two more observations on the list of rights. The Commission would like to reiterate that it is favourable towards the idea of a charter encompassing both civil and political rights, as well as social rights and rights deriving from European citizenship. However, the Commission would like to see rights drafted on the basis of the European Convention on Human Rights, whenever necessary, made innovative, to the extent that they update the 1950 drafting of the Rome Convention and respond to the new challenges of human rights as well as those resulting from information technology, bioethics, gender equality, as part of the fight against all forms of discrimination, and paying close attention to environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that in our opinion, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is not intended to replace either national constitutions or the European Convention on Human Rights. It has an obvious target, namely the Union’s institutions and the Member States, when they transpose the provisions of Community law into their respective national legal systems. It is also clear who the beneficiaries of this will be. Following the Tampere decision, it is the citizens of the Union’s Member States who will benefit from the Union’s fundamental laws, as well as the citizens of third countries who have permanent legal residence in EU countries, where the Heads of State and Government clearly said that they should have rights and obligations as similar as possible to the rights and obligations of the citizens of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that under this action plan, with closer collaboration between the Commission and the European Parliament, we will have a legal instrument that will banish the spectre created by the fear of contradictions and the spectre of the European superstate, but which will above all ensure that there is a legal system, based on fundamental rights, for the benefit of those on whose behalf we are all here – the citizens of our Union.</p>
