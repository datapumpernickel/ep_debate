<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cappato (TDI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is a pity that, after a whole day during which Parliament has debated matters in which it has no legislative competence, only in the afternoon and then the evening will we actually be talking about areas in which we do have legislative power. It is rather a bad Parliamentary habit, and we should try to resist these headline-grabbing temptations.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the European Commission’s proposal for a directive is an important document and will help to protect rights and also freedoms on line, not only as regards the electronic communications of citizens within Europe, and thus we congratulate the Commission on the work that has been done. I must start, however, by saying that the Commission itself should, I believe, take greater account of the fact that the difficulties and delays in implementing directives in the Member States mean that we are in danger of having European laws that are increasingly specific and detailed, which attempt to keep up with technological progress, but then we find ourselves updating a 1997 directive, now four years old, when this directive has still not been implemented by all the Member States: it is a specific directive relating to a general directive from 1995 which itself has not yet been adopted by the Member States. It is therefore this legislative method that should probably be debated!</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, however, I genuinely believe that important measures for protecting European citizens’ privacy are guaranteed and specified, measures that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights and its rapporteur fully upheld in committee and which were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to focus on two points that are, perhaps, more politically controversial: the power of public and state authorities to have access to European Union citizens’ personal data, and unsolicited commercial e-mail.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights accepted the European Commission’s desire not to grant the kind of carte blanche or blank cheque that some countries in the Union would have liked, to be able to intercept and access European Union citizens’ personal data, for instance by accessing data collected by telephone companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is right to insist on and uphold this point. We hope that it will also follow us in a further request expressed by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, of placing a precise obligation on all derogations from the directive or European regulations that are not completely exceptional, based on a specific law accessible to the public, and limited in time; this will have the consequence, which we have written into the report, of prohibiting generalised surveillance. I think it is important that the Commission should uphold this, because I believe the greatest threat to citizens’ privacy is the omnipotence of the state in accessing personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other point – unsolicited commercial e-mails – I have preferred, and the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights has followed me, not to accept the Commission proposal of imposing a harmonised Europe-wide opt-in system, but to leave each Member State the choice of opting in or opting out. I believe, in fact, that both systems are ineffective at stopping so-called spamming: true spammers who block up electronic mail boxes are people who do so fraudulently, hiding their addresses, and so have no interest in respecting either opting-in or opting-out. In the absolute ban of opt-in, I see a threat to the freedom of expression of those who conduct e-commerce correctly: for freedom of expression it is not so easy to separate commercial messages from non-commercial messages, and there may be journalistic or political texts that are sponsored and as such could be treated as commercial messages.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that today there are instruments for self-regulation, filters and technologies that can solve the problem much more flexibly and effectively than the courts can. Furthermore, the costs that the consumer has to bear are set to fall with the liberalisation of telecommunications that the Commission is pressing for in the other directives in the package. Therefore, with flat rates and broad band connections, even the cost problem of connecting for a few seconds is becoming less important. That is why, faced with the possible risks of the opt-in system, we are opposed to a single, harmonised European system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cederschiöld (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we are all of us affected on a daily basis by the risks presented by the new computer-related crimes. It happens every time we shop using credit cards, use a telephone, open our e-mail or travel by plane. We are concerned here with traditional crimes which affect us partly due to information technology: child pornography, counterfeiting, xenophobia and the trades in drugs, human beings, human organs, weapons etc. However, we are also concerned here with new types of crime directed against the way in which society operates: the spreading of viruses, unauthorised access, hacking,<span class="italic"> </span>denial of service etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditional methods of combating these crimes are inadequate, even if on-line crime is just as criminal as off-line crime. The underworld is threatening society with new methods from a digital platform. Criminals exploit the differences in legislation between one Member State and another, and so the EU must maintain a united front.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has tabled proposals to which the Committee is giving impetus and which it is developing. We seek common definitions for solving conflicts of competence, as well as the closer harmonisation of criminal law and the law of procedure and the mutual recognition of preliminary investigation procedures. We want to make Europol and Eurojust more effective but, at the same time, set clear limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, controversial demands are also being made for the interception, registration and storage of our communications. Where these are concerned, the Committee demands respect for fundamental rights, such as the secrecy of correspondence and telephone calls, and strict requirements for the whole area. The Committee also demands a ban on such invasions of privacy, except in those cases in which the measure fulfils all the following requirements: it is necessary, has proper justification, is the only possible solution, is proportionate to the crime, is limited in time and has been decided upon in the courts. <span class="italic">No one</span> wants a big brother society.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union must comply with the demand we ourselves have made for cheap Internet access for all citizens, which means that we cannot transfer the costs of this to companies. We want to encourage voluntary cooperation and have therefore proposed the setting up of an open forum to which a variety of players can contribute their experiences and pool these for the benefit of all, a forum in which understanding can increase, awareness of these problems be developed and best practice be promoted. In this forum, industry and legal authorities, together with consumers, will be able to create a code of conduct and develop early warning and crisis management systems, and it will be possible to develop preventive technology and protective measures and to make these more widely available.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination within the EU is also required so that our measures are not rendered ineffective at a global level. Member States and candidate countries should be invited to develop common tactics and a cohesive EU policy within international bodies such as the UN, the OECD, the Council of Europe and the G8.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was unanimous and gave its support to the message of the report, which is about improving respect for personal privacy now that evermore effective measures to combat computer-related crime have to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a big and heartfelt thank you to everyone who has assisted in the preparation of this report. There are a lot of you, since there are many conflicting interests that have been reconciled.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word about the two amendments that have been introduced to the report. They can be seen as technical in nature. The first is aimed at adding the word ‘terrorism’, since the committee unanimously adopted this as an oral amendment which has since in some way been lost from the text submitted to plenary. The word ‘terrorism’ must, of course, be present in a report on cyber crime. We also want to change the term ‘labelling’. This change is proposed because ‘labelling’ obviously does not cover what we intend as effectively as ‘certification’, which is the term we wish to introduce. The term we use in Swedish, ‘märkning’, is tricky to translate. This is mainly a translation issue, then.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the Cappato report. Because I do not have very much time, I shall concentrate entirely on the opt-in/opt-out debate. It is too early at this stage to abolish subsidiarity and force everyone to give up the status quo with its freedom of choice and instead to introduce an opt-in clause. There would then be a risk of being criticised for over-regulation. We should be in danger of having a new ‘cucumber debate’, with the EU being criticised for its passion for detailed regulation. Through being contrary to two important directives in the area of information technology, such a move could damage future legislation in this area and render our existing legislation inconsistent. The debate on constitutional issues could also be harmed because such action could lead to a loss of confidence in the EU. This would apply especially to the European Parliament if we were to adopt inconsistent positions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the middle of a process of technical development, involving filtering and broad band, which may mean that this opt-in/opt-out debate will be out of date and a thing of the past in three years’ time. I do not think that we should become bogged down in an outmoded position and, at the same time, abolish the possibility of choice without obtaining any added value, for a European opt-in solution would not put an end to <span class="italic">spamming, </span>a lot of which originates outside the EU. The United States itself has not harmonised its legislation, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">An opt-in system involves problems in drawing the line between commercial information, on the one hand, and information about society and voluntary organisations, on the other. It could also prevent the development of newspapers on the Net and create difficulties for small companies which have to store their information in case they are prosecuted. How, moreover, would the punishment be meted out?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we politicians must not legislate as soon as we see a phenomenon we do not like. As politicians, we do not always know what is best for each individual person and company in each particular case. Our job is to speed up the development and distribution of the technical products which will make <span class="italic">spamming</span> a thing of the past and to press for supervision, something which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s amendment in fact does.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must, as politicians, defend freedom of expression and not restrict it unnecessarily and without due care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To come back to the points made by Mrs Cederschiöld, I have heard in many forums and many other communications media in the Internet and e-mail that there has been a great deal of annoyance among users. This is logical, for if we examine the principles of opt-in and opt-out using the example of letter mail, opt-out simply means that e-mails are paid on delivery, i.e. by the addressee. After all, it is the users who pay the Internet access fees. I would get very annoyed about this too. This is not to say that this is a bad intervention, but I would vote for an opt-in system for e-mails.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I think that the directive’s major shortcoming is what is not regulated, namely monitoring by the state, which is explicitly excluded. I think that this poses the greatest threat to fundamental rights in the European Union – and fundamental rights are there to protect citizens from the state. This is excluded here, which means that the directive is inadequate. The rest offers quite a good level of protection. However, if we draw together the opinion on <span class="italic">cybercrime</span> and Parliament’s opinion on terrorism, it is quite striking that a great many things are thrown together and criminalised: for example, “everything which is illegal offline should be illegal online”. This is the case anyway, so we do not need any directives on cybercrime. No one has yet given me a plausible explanation of why we actually need this, and which new laws will be adopted and crimes defined which are not already covered elsewhere. In my view, this whole cybercrime issue is primarily intended to legitimise intervention in fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to remind you of an anniversary which took place two days ago. A hundred years ago, the typewriter was banned in Turkey. Why? Because it was feared that it would enable people to communicate anonymously; they could no longer be identified by their handwriting, and this would open the door to crime. Banning the typewriter was intended to prevent this. Perhaps this would be appropriate once again today?! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, as Mrs Cederschiöld said, a very controversial and difficult area which raises issues of how to regulate the Internet and yet not stifle its development; and also significant issues regarding crime surveillance and privacy, data protection and retention, yet we need to be aware the cybercriminals do not respect our personal integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a growing phenomenon of so-called data streaming – hacking into computer systems and stealing credit card details in bulk. The total cost loss to the UK last year was GBP300 million, an increase of 55% on 1999. We need more secure systems if we are to boost consumer confidence in using the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in your strategy I want you to prioritise tackling the very disturbing growth in child pornography on the Internet. We need to clamp down on sexual exploitation of children. Again, there has been a very massive growth in cross-border child pornography. In the UK, members of the so-called “Wonderland Club”, an Internet paedophilia ring, were arrested and found to have sites in 12 different European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own region, the Greater Manchester Obscene Publications Unit has had success in cracking down on paedophilia with new Internet tracing software. That is why, with the backing of many of the children’s organisations across the European Union, we are calling for a number of actions. We want you to look at the possibility of involving credit card companies and Internet service providers in supporting the blacklisting of sites trading in illegal pornographic content. We want to see the expansion of 24-hour hotlines and electronic watchtowers. We want to see the creation of a European rating system for child-friendly Internet providers and the display of child safety messages. We want child pornography on news groups blocked. We want closer involvement by Europol in prosecuting cyber paedophiles and better cooperation between European law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must act to ensure that there are no safe havens in Europe for cyber paedophiles. Our message, therefore, is that we are stepping up our action and closing down these sites. We want you, Commissioner, to take action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, virtual reality, while it has a great deal going for it, engenders not virtual but very real crimes which we need to deal with without making bogeymen of ourselves. We must be ready to prevent and punish these crimes as and when they appear. Secure infrastructures and crime prevention need to go hand in glove with respect for freedoms and personal data protection. This is something which we should never forget and which needs to be kept in a state of equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we need coordination at international level and obviously the role of the Member States and of the European Union is to operate in international organisations with an appropriate strategy because we cannot resolve the problem alone. The Internet is international and needs to be addressed internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we need better definitions of the various types of crimes. We cannot talk in general terms and what appear to be the most important issues today, i.e. pornography, hackers and racism, will not necessarily be the most important issues tomorrow. Commercial crime is also very important and I think that we need to work with industry and the banks here if we are to be sure that the solutions found are indeed the most suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular aspect, which colours all the rest, is intellectual property, which is in huge danger and could end up disadvantaging authors and artists. I think that we need working protection rather than excessive measures which will stop the Internet from operating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
