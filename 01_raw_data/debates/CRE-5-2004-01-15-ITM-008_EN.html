Haiti was once seen as a glimmer of hope for slaves taken from Africa to America, who were able to join together in establishing a free republic there.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, 200 years after Haiti achieved independence, we cannot but note that it is poor, broken-down and wracked by violence as never before, and those who have seen the place first-hand can only sink into pessimism.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met the present President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on two occasions. The first was a number of years ago, when he was still regarded as the shining light of potential democratisation in Haiti. Those who had turned out in large numbers to elect him by a large majority had believed that, having been freed from the dictatorship of Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, they would now be able to have a new life in a bright future. This, unfortunately, turned out to be a great mistake, and he too was driven out of office. During his exile, we covertly smuggled him into the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Santo Domingo, for we too believed that Haiti could have a good future under Aristide.</p>
<p class="contents">My second meeting with him was after the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, when I had the honour of leading a delegation that the Committee on Development and Cooperation sent to Haiti. It was apparent from this encounter that we are dealing with a man who no longer has any idea where he is coming from, but that is not, in my view, the worst of it. We are dealing with someone whose views are akin to fascism – there is no other way of putting it – and who treats all democratic institutions with utter contempt. So it is that Haiti has, for the past three days, again been without a parliament, as the term of office for the deputies expired on 12 January and there is no prospect of new elections. There are, admittedly, still a handful of senators in the second chamber, but that does not legitimise anything. What we are seeing here is a failure to hold elections, the falsification of ballots, the intimidation of the electorate, of whom – as was apparent the last time – only some 5% turn out to vote, most preferring to stay at home where they feel safer. Such is day-to-day political life in Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always possible to separate political and criminal forces. Death squads dispose of those opposition elements who incur the regime’s displeasure, and journalists who try to maintain something like standards of independent reporting are persecuted and even killed. I could go on in this vein for hours. We will have to support those forces that are combating these abuses; the caravans of hope are coming together. We should be supporting these forces in the hope that things in Haiti may take a turn for the better.</p>

Mr Aristide carried the hopes of many, but we can all see what has happened in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only we Europeans who must ask ourselves where we went wrong with our policy over many decades, what we did or failed to do: the Americans certainly must, for they are closer to hand geographically speaking. Why did the western half of Hispaniola – which is a large island – turn out like this? Of course not everything is ideal in the Dominican Republic on the other side of the border, but, all the same, the fact that millions of Europeans and Americans go there as tourists and at least bring some money into the country is an indicator that things cannot be that terrible. The situation is not yet ideal, but this does show that you can stay in the place with some degree of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certain that we must look to ourselves for answers as to what we did wrong. This House has been making very concrete demands of Haiti; political murders must be stopped; members of the ruling party must be compelled to uphold justice and maintain the law; the militias, the armed brigades and the so-called special brigades of the police must be disbanded and disarmed, and a start must be made on a national dialogue between the government and the opposition, so that the caravan of hope can reach its destination. What would be best – and what we demand – is that this should be done through the mediation of the United Nations, and that the UN Mission must be re-established to work together with the Haitian police.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions have to be created under which the suspension of the Cotonou agreement in accordance with its Article 96 can again be lifted, for our support is urgently necessary, especially in the areas of education and health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the country became independent, it put an end to the slavery and exploitation of an entire people, which had lasted for decades. What kind of celebrations can there be, what kind of congratulations can we offer to the Haitian government, such has been the downfall of this country, in which all optimism has been reduced to nothing? A vicious circle has dashed the hopes and extinguished the symbol represented by Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">President Aristide, previously a torchbearer for democracy, and reinstated by American intervention, has drowned Haiti in the mire of the third world. The country has degenerated into a caricature of the poorest of the poor on the American continent and within the ACP. A collapsed social economy is strangling the population and discouraging local and regional aid, while the black market prospers in the hands of the highest echelons of the regime. The environmental disasters of deforestation and floods have heaped further misery on a desperate people.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving up in the face of such chaos would be the final nail in Haiti’s coffin. Two centuries of Haitian independence have revealed the resourcefulness, the will and the ideals of the people, who represent the seeds of a rebirth of democracy and prosperity. Condemnation of the current regime and situation, however, cannot hide the difficulties that exist and the abuses committed by countries of the region and of the West, within their framework of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that not even the UNDP’s cry has evoked a response that will result in humanitarian aid. The international community’s disarray leads only to a lack of investment of resources and attention. The EU’s cooperation agreement must be capable of adapting to the current situation, in conjunction with regional and international organisations. We must not be daunted by Haiti; rather, we should view it as a challenge and a laboratory of transition for the EU in its cooperation with the ACP countries. While remaining resolute, we must encourage dialogue with civil society, and request a UN mediator to reach a long-term political agreement, in order to help the Haitian people back onto the road to democracy and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Aristide, its Head of State, certainly deserves no sympathy, as he has betrayed the hopes that his people placed in him. One cannot help but feel deep disgust, however, when politicians from the major powers, in particular France and the USA, who are overwhelmingly implicated in Haiti’s fate, begin to lecture and moralise.</p>
<p class="contents">Two centuries ago, Haiti was one of the wealthiest countries in the Caribbean, but has become one of the poorest in the world. This is because it has been constantly pillaged and because France, its former colonial ruler, has never forgiven the country for winning independence by armed struggle and a slave revolt. Over the course of the decades, newly-independent Haiti has been subject to a blockade by France, with the complicity of the US and UK, in order to force Haiti to pay compensation to the former slave-owners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly in order to court mass popularity that Aristide is today demanding reimbursement of this colossal sum, which Haiti was obliged to pay until the twentieth century. This claim does, however, have historical legitimacy, and paying back the stolen money would enable the country to establish an infrastructure, a road network, a water supply system and a health care system, which it almost completely lacks, and that would be only the start.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general level, the sum required to alleviate the poverty of this country located a short stretch of water away from the wealthy USA would be a pittance for the major powers. Instead of helping Haiti, however, these major powers continue to pillage the country, with the few French and USA companies established in the country paying scandalously low wages, and taking back to the USA all the profits made on the backs of Haitian workers, rather than investing profits productively. It is precisely by showing solidarity with the people of Haiti that we can dissociate ourselves from the cynical and hypocritical declarations of those who claim to defend their freedoms.</p>

<p class="contents">I must not use my speaking time to repeat everything that my fellow MEPs have said about President Aristide. Historic injustices are difficult to remedy, and reconstruction of a country demands not only the right leader but also the right institutions to control him.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things have gone completely wrong in Haiti. Neither Parliament, the courts nor the police function, and there are daily reports of serious human rights violations. The most basic right, that to food, is being violated to a quite incredible degree. Half the population is starving, and 23% of all Haitian children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, factors that are a direct threat to Haiti’s prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the international community cannot, and should not, look on silently. The humanitarian aid must correspond to the Haitian population’s real needs, and the strongest possible political pressure should be exercised to get the parties to enter into dialogue and work towards a political solution. A political solution is the only way of reintroducing a system providing legal certainty and respect for human rights, and the only option for solving the structural problems that have brought Haiti to the brink of famine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas; 80% of its population live below the poverty line. It has one of the lowest life expectancies, literacy rates and health indicators in a region which, as someone has already said, is itself rather poor. The political, social and economic crises have all worsened in the last four years. Half the population suffers from malnutrition; there is difficult access to clean water and where traditional exports have collapsed, drug trafficking and corruption are flourishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Worse, the recently-formed Haitian National Police has been able to enforce the rule of law and has been severely criticised by human rights groups for its own abuse of protesters protesting against President Aristide's rule and for failing to protect them from machete and gun-wielding government-supporting militias.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn all the violence and political assassinations. We call upon the Haitian Government, the opposition and civil society to engage in a constructive dialogue, possibly in the framework of a national conference to pave the way for free and fair legislative elections. We call on the Council and Commission to use all political and diplomatic means to encourage the Haitian authorities, opposition parties and civil society to facilitate this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we ask for the restoration of the United Nations mission working with the Haitian police, the disbandment of the so-called special brigades – as suggested by the UN Special Envoy – and the disarming of the militias. That would be the first step on what may be a possible path to a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, as a Christian and a co-signatory of the petition, I put into practice the wise Biblical saying: ‘let other lips praise you’. In contacts with workers in the field, I always ask what practical help the European Union can give. I gladly endorse the suggestions that committed experts on Haiti have made to the Council and the Commission: firstly, that there should be support for local food production programmes and improvement in health care; secondly, careful observation of the human rights situation on the ground by the European delegation in Port-au-Prince, with careful reports on it sent to Parliament; and finally, the encouragement of constructive dialogue between government, opposition and civil society in accordance with paragraph 3 of the draft resolution. The attacks this week on various radio stations in Haiti, which are the source of information for the country’s people, underline once again the urgent need for European action in Haiti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We encourage all parties in Haiti to respect Resolution 822 of the Organisation of American States and to work towards a rapid political agreement. This is necessary to allow free and fair elections to take place in the near future in a climate of security and mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">A key element in the resolution of the crisis is the formation of a credible electoral council. Despite the announcement of elections, this key element is still not in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recalls that for the last three years Haiti has been subject to appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. Last December the Council decided to extend the measures for a further year. Under these measures, some Community aid to Haiti is suspended. However, the Community still provides considerable support of direct benefit to the Haitian population. Actions to strengthen civil society and the private sector, to support democratisation and strengthen the rule of law, to fight poverty and to give humanitarian and emergency assistance are being pursued. The European Union intends to remain present in Haiti and to promote a solution to the political crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law constitute essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement. Such elements are not in place in Haiti. Normalisation of the EU's relations with Haiti depends on the fulfilment by the government of the conditions of the OAS resolution. In a letter sent by the Commission and the Council at the beginning of January 2004 to the government of Haiti informing it of the extension of appropriate measures, the Union urges the government rapidly to translate its commitment to comply with the requirements of OAS Resolution 822 into concrete actions, which would lead to free and fair national and local elections. The Commission is ready to provide support for elections in Haiti if they take place in accordance with the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, ECHO has responded to natural disasters mainly flooding by funding relief operations. In addition, Haiti has been a priority in ECHO's programmes, which support activities to improve vulnerable populations' preparedness for disaster. Current funding for such projects in Haiti amounts to more than EUR 1 million. The Commission's growing concern with the deteriorating situation in the country is reflected in the fact that Haiti is listed as one of the forgotten crises in ECHO's 2004 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament may be assured that the Commission is actively promoting a solution to the political crisis in Haiti and is using the means at its disposal to respond to the urgent needs of the Haitian population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
