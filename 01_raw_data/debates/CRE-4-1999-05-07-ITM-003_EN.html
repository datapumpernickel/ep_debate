<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hoppenstedt </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the House discussed Expo 2000 in 1990, Venice was still being mooted as a possibility. It was made clear that it would be tantamount to a natural disaster if Venice was chosen to host the exhibition. At the time, and without realising, of course, that I would be speaking as the rapporteur on the last day of this five‐year parliamentary term, I said that if Venice was not going to be considered, Hanover should be Europe"s representative to compete against Toronto. We know the outcome. Today, some ten years later, we are voting on how Europe is to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is quite a background to this, of course, because for the last 18 months we, and I myself in particular, have been working to move this whole project forward so as to ensure that there is adequate funding for the European Union to be represented at Hanover, and that is by no means an easy task, as you know. This was why we made such a push last year for the 1999 budget, and thanks to all those colleagues who recognised how important it was for the European Union to take part in Hanover, particularly in the year 2000, it was voted through. I would like to thank all those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I was entrusted with the report in March 1998, not March 1999 as it says here, and since then quite a lot has happened. However, the report itself has appeared rather late in the day. This was because the Lisbon World Exhibition was also important for the European Union and the Commission was very much taken up with it. But it was not too late, because the European Union will be in one of the Expo General Commissariat"s pavilions and will have an excellent position at the head of the European Boulevard near the Plaza. I think the European Union has a good chance of attracting a large number of visitors. As I have said in my report, we do not want the entrance to the European Union to be through the back door to some building or other. No, the European Union must be open to all spectators, and this is what we have achieved through our work together. If we can look forward to a total budget of some EUR 15 million, including the 2000 budget, then it is all thanks to the efforts of our colleagues. And we need the money, because this pavilion looks both back to the past and forward to the future. The theme in Hanover is ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology", depicted in various imaginative ways, and what institution could be in a better position than the European Union to bring together all the various ideas from around the world and in the Member States, and to disseminate these ideas to give new impetus for the future?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have also been quite successful in having a square near the European pavilion or the European exhibition named after Robert Schuman as an indication of how important Robert Schuman was for the development of Europe, and to have a square that will remain in use in the future. The exhibition centre and buildings will not be disappearing, but are to remain as a living centre in Hanover and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another European element in the European Union"s exhibition on the theme of ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology": the euro. The euro will be featured as one of the most recent developments that is of enormous importance for the future in particular, and we have arranged with the relevant bodies, including through requests made by our committees here in the House, to be able to use the euro as an electronic currency. I think that it is important for the many millions of visitors to be able to use the euro and to explain to other people how it will work in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that everyone will pull together on this, including in the future, and since I will no longer be here in Parliament, I would ask Doris Pack, Paul Rübig and others to ensure that it is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, I will not be returning to Parliament, and I should like to thank all those colleagues who have worked so closely with me in the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Culture, especially on these topics that are so important for the future. I should also like to thank the interpreters sitting in their booths, who have communicated our activities here to others. My thanks go to everyone, and I hope to see you again in some other arena in the future!</p>

It is extremely important for the European Union to be involved in an event like Expo 2000, which will attract enormous attention from the media and the public. It is important to present an image of Europe for inward consumption, for the Union"s own citizens, but also outwardly, for visitors from around the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must get closer to the people in its activities, raising its profile among passing trade, as it were, and the Expo is an ideal forum for this. In the Committee on Culture too we have repeatedly stressed that the exhibition should not just show Europe"s economic successes, but should also illustrate the European Union"s cultural diversity and in particular its successful programmes. I would also urge – and this is addressed to the organisers of the exhibition – that Parliament should be able to demonstrate its independent role in initiating these programmes, and it should be kept entirely separate from the Commission both in the pavilion and in the budget for the event.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to take the opportunity to urge the Council once again not just to be proud of our cultural achievements here, but to ensure that there is sufficient funding for the programmes, because there is absolutely no point in getting the public interested in all these wonderful programmes that the European Union organises if the level of funding is just a joke.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">von Habsburg </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Hoppenstedt most sincerely for his excellent report, which I have followed with great interest – not so much the exhibition in Hanover as the problems that it has generated. I am also glad that Mr Elchlepp spoke on the subject, for the simple reason that he too produced a wonderful report on an earlier occasion which I still remember with pleasure. I would like to thank him once again for that report.</p>
<p class="contents">Like any exhibition, the Expo in Hanover will be very important if it is used for the right purpose, as Mr Hoppenstedt underlined. But I would also like to look a little further forward, because there will be other exhibitions in future, and we should be starting to think now about things that will be vital for these future events. Time and again the vital cultural dimension is missing, as Mr Hoppenstedt rightly said, yet this is one of Europe"s great strengths, and we should focus more attention on the cultural side of things instead of selling it short.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should remember that we have not always done ourselves justice here, particularly at exhibitions. As the 2005 Expo is, I am delighted to say, to be held in Nagoya in Japan, I would point out that the exhibition in Osaka led to a number of scandalous bureaucratic blunders, when they built the Europe pavilion but refused to put up the Coudenhove‐Kalergi statue. After a wave of protests the European Community, as it was then, explained that it could not afford it. Then came the most shameful thing of all – the Japanese themselves bought a very fine Coudenhove‐Kalergi statue for the pavilion. This also reminds me of something that happened here in this very building with a statue that was removed by the bureaucrats and has now been returned. We should think of our own roots, and when we go to Japan in particular – and 2005 is not so far away – we should focus on the links we have with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we cannot afford to operate just within the European Union: we must also take Europe out into a world that is, whether we like it or not, becoming increasingly globalised and in which partnerships in the Far East are also of vital importance to us. This is why I feel that even today we should all be thinking about what to do in Nagoya. The Asians are, after all, our logical partners. They are a great deal more culturally aware than certain bureaucrats here, and they would be very impressed if we gave our culture pride of place.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember a Croatian exhibition that we had once that was Croatia"s first appearance in this building. I was wrong at the time to insist that we should stop pandering to tourists. Thank goodness no one listened to me and they brought culture into the building, which was the best thing they could have done in the long run. We should think about all this very carefully, and because we are now preparing to organise an event in Germany and the preparations are going so well, we should be starting to think a little further forward. I must apologise for having pre‐empted the next two stages, because we need to make long‐term plans for our European culture and taking Europe out into the world, and we need to ensure that this impression of Europe is spread much further. As this is the last time I shall be speaking in the European Parliament, I would urge my successors not to forget culture, because it is vitally important. We are a cultural continent and we should remember that this is the most permanent feature that Europe has!</p>

A glance backwards would not be out of place, however. Let us consider how past Expos have turned out, and what sort of impression they have left on us. Several members of the Green Group were in Lisbon and felt very disappointed about the whole event. Lessons should be learnt from this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group in the European Parliament therefore maintains a ‘constructively critical" attitude towards the Hanover Expo. It is important that the exhibition should be held. As Mr von Habsburg said, what is at stake here is culture. I am also glad that we are resisting ‘EU nationalism" by not restricting ourselves to European culture alone. Countries outside Europe will be included, so that we can draw on cultural knowledge from around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as this particular Expo is concerned, there are some purely budgetary issues to bear in mind, as the Committee on Budgets has pointed out. One aspect is the fact that a huge amount of money is being spent on this exhibition. Appropriations for the European campaign to combat violence against women come under the same budget item. I trust that resources for the latter will not be eaten up by the Expo. My personal opinion is that the campaign on violence against women is actually more important from a future perspective than this exhibition.</p>
<p class="contents">The theme of the Expo is highly relevant: ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology'. I myself find the range a little narrow, nonetheless, and am not one hundred per cent sure that the EU should be getting involved in such an event. Yet I believe in the end that the Green Group should support the idea of taking the project forward. In parallel, however, we need a thorough evaluation of exhibitions of this kind. Lessons can then be learnt for future occasions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Hoppenstedt on his last speech, which was very much to the point and summed up what all this is about, namely linking modern technology with nature and mankind. He has been very successful in fighting for this in his time in the European Parliament, for which I congratulate him. The world exhibition in Hanover is to run from 1 June to the end of October 2000, in other words about a year before euro notes and coins come into circulation. The whole world will be there, as millions of visitors converge on Hanover not just from the 15 Member States, but also from the rest of the globe. One hundred and seventy countries and 14 international organisations are to exhibit, so it is important for Parliament, the Commission and the Council to start thinking now about the meetings they could organise, because a visit to the world exhibition should also primarily involve meeting up with other people, holding conferences and reaching agreements. It is an ideal platform for us in Europe, and it is one that we should exploit to the maximum.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I would also urge that we should hold our interparliamentary meetings there, for example. Hanover has an extremely modern conference centre which is right there on the exhibition site, and it has excellent infrastructure with full interpreting facilities. It would be a good opportunity to show the rest of the world outside Europe the possibilities that Europe has for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like attention to be focused in particular on the ‘Edu‐tainment Centre", placing the ‘learning adventure" – lifelong learning – at the centre of our efforts. We should show what the European Union has already achieved, and we should ensure that all the information is made available on VDUs, on the Internet, on multimedia, for young people, the elderly, in fact anyone interested, in the form of ‘Infotainment". I think the ‘learning adventure" is a special challenge, and this modern way of learning is very important and a tremendous opportunity for schoolchildren, students and everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must take advantage of the infrastructure around Hanover, which has been developed to a very high standard. I am already looking forward to the opening of this major exhibition.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I should like to congratulate the Committee on Culture, and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Hoppenstedt, for this comprehensive report on Expo 2000 Hannover. In the year 2000, Expo 2000 Hannover will be a major communication event on a world scale. The theme for the exhibition is mankind, nature and technology. The organisers, under the leadership of the Expo Commissioner General, are committed to presenting current and future options on how to achieve a balanced and harmonious coexistence of the theme's three elements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission's intention to ensure the participation of the European Union and its institutions at this important event. This was also outlined in our communication of 18 March. We are pleased to see that all EU Member States will participate in this event. The vast majority will have their pavilions located on the so‐called European boulevard. The EU pavilion would be at the heart of this, just opposite the host country's pavilion.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of Union participation at Expo 2000 is to present the crucial role the European Union is playing, through its institutions, as a forward‐looking, dynamic actor on the world stage at the dawn of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased to note that Mr Hoppenstedt's report gives positive backing to the Commission's intention to organise Union participation at Expo 2000. The report specifically underlines the importance of a coherent and balanced presentation within the Union pavilion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Mr Hoppenstedt that the Union pavilion must present the best possible image of the European Union in the 21st century: a European Union which is democratic, transparent, law‐abiding, socially just, tolerant and culturally diverse. What we strive for is to make its citizens aware of the reality of European integration and of the Union's role in international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our aim that such a presentation will be based on the use of the latest interactive multimedia and electronic technology available. This will ensure that visitors, and in particular the younger generation, will have an eye‐catching and thought‐provoking experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to inform you that an architect's competition for the design of the Union's pavilion has now been judged. Its results are due to be announced formally in the EC Official Journal. The companies involved in the competition have also been informed directly. The Commission is responsible for the official coordination of all EU institutions to ensure they participate in a coherent manner in Expo.</p>
<p class="contents">I can report to you that such coordination has already begun. The Commission's inter‐service task force, and an interinstitutional working party have been created. The detailed programme of activities and communication strategies is being developed within these two bodies along the lines of the Commission's communication and the Culture Committee's report. Regular reports on the progress of this work will be made to the Culture Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budget, an estimated amount of EUR 14 m is proposed for the year 1999‐2000 on budget line B3‐309, Special Annual Events. This budget, which will cover the needs of all EU institutions, is deemed the minimum necessary to finance the proper participation of the Union at the Expo. It will be recalled that a total of EUR 10 m was earmarked on budget line B3‐309/99 in order to finance two activities: Expo 2000 and a European campaign to combat violence against women. In addition to this it is strongly recommended that a further EUR 6.5 m is voted for in the budget for the next year, the year 2000, to complete the Expo 2000 action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is confident that the interinstitutional cooperation already set in place will produce the necessary positive results to allow the budgetary authority to determine favourably the budget for 2000. The Commission also welcomes the proposal to second Parliament staff to work at Expo 2000. This will be in addition to the Commission staff that will be devoted to this action. The estimated administrative expenditure for this participation is EUR 1.44 m on part (A) of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission looks forward to continuing cooperation with the European Parliament and its services to ensure that the Union's participation at Expo 2000 will be an important event in bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to its citizens.</p>
