<p class="contents">I will highlight the positive impact that Article 31, in its amended version, will have on the very important area of tourist services. It is a question, in fact, of paving the way for large, balanced flows of incoming tourists, by carefully following a path that identifies the way in which to harmonise the huge numbers of tourists in the various countries. I therefore call on the Commission to thoroughly revise and relaunch a directive that many Member States have so far failed to comply with – Directive 320 of 1992 – so that the policy of high-quality services is fully realised and, with that, the objective of sustainable European tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In actual fact, I have no difficulty in acknowledging the improvements made – and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt – to Mr Bolkestein’s initial proposal. Nor do I have any difficulty in admitting that I have been left unsatisfied as a result of the uncertainties linked to Article 16. Although I voted in favour of the compromise amendments on this report, I cannot endorse it and I chose in the end to reject it because it symbolises a serious historic break with the principles that have, up to now, enabled European integration to be taken forward. Solidarity and regulations are giving way to competition among the countries and the peoples of Europe. I deplore this state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The only European institution able to bring about this deep and inspired change is our Parliament. This is undoubtedly because we listened to our fellow citizens and to their anxieties and fears; and it is undoubtedly because we endeavour above all to champion a European model of common values and because we will always prefer upwards harmonisation to downwards dumping. We have done some good work, and the Commission and the Council will really have at last to take account of the strong political signal that we are sending today and that expresses our desire to complete the internal market, while preserving our social model. For our part, we will make sure that they do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to pay tribute to the considerable work done by Mr Harbour, who - along with my friend, Mr Toubon - followed the matter on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. There was an increasingly urgent need to legislate so as not to leave it to the Court of Justice’s magistrates to ‘lay down the law’ on the fourth fundamental freedom of the Union as it relates to services.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise makes it possible to outline a framework supporting the competitiveness and development of service activities, which represent 70% of GDP and great potential in terms of growth and job creation, while combating the risks of social dumping. Mr Chirac, the President of the French Republic, was right to oppose the first text presented in January 2004 by the Prodi Commission, and the European Parliament did its job as co-legislator properly.

<p class="contents">1) This House may well have made improvements to the Commission draft, but I do not regard them as sufficient.

<p class="contents">3) What we need is a social and trustworthy Europe with the same harmonised ground rules across the whole of internal market, and this directive is no way to create one.</p>

Even though the overly explicit references to the country of origin principle have disappeared, there are still areas in which this scandalous principle will apply in full or in part. The uncertainties, the grey areas and the inconsistencies that remain will give the Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to apply its own interpretation to the directive.

We welcome the Services Directive and believe that, irrespective of the country they come from, services companies should not be discriminated against in any EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">The core issue in the debate on the Services Directive is that of whether the directive should be guided by the country of origin principle (Article 16). The June List values both the internal market and national self-determination. The fundamental question is thus as follows: does the country of origin principle entail such decisive advantages that we are prepared to renounce national sovereignty? Our answer to that question is no.</p>
<p class="contents">The country of origin principle relates to significant, but strictly limited, areas such as construction, installation work and consultancy services. We welcome competition within these areas, but believe that it must take place on conditions that are fair to all parties. We believe that Swedish rules must apply on Swedish territory. We thus support what is known as the host country principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also of the view that national monopolies on services should be respected. Precisely what shape is to be taken by these services should be decided following broad discussion in the respective Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">As a result of the resounding condemnation of the worst aspects of this proposal and the workers’ campaign to have the directive rejected, the majority in Parliament has excluded some areas from its scope, putting a decision on them back to a later date and, in a feat of legal sleight of hand, has concealed the regulation applying the law on the country of origin of the service provider.</p>

That is what the Court of Justice confirmed by recognising a COP, a country of origin principle. For the blind among us, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, signed in Marrakech in April 1994, laid down, throughout the world, a ‘fourth mode’ of service provision, in the form of a cross-border provision of services, that is to say of a temporary switch to the social dumping conditions of the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this old principle that the leaders of Europe are now pretending to discover, whereas this COP has been devastating European economies for decades. Seeking to maintain the French-influenced European social model, with its pensions, its health protection, its free schools, its post offices, its trains and its hospitals, demands that we not only oppose workers being paid the lowest possible wages, as practised in the most socially backward countries, but that we also oppose the idea of a market without customs protection, which is the real cause of social dumping. The rule of the COP is only one symptom of this social dumping. The starting point – the first rogue cell – of this social cancer is the idea of the single market, without the protection of customs duties.

Existing differences would be made into a factor in competition, the intention being that the worst would always win. This extremely neo-liberal approach was intended to wreck all that the labour movement had fought for and achieved over the course of a century.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the directive in its original form will not see the light of day is thanks to the mass action on the part of trade unionists and other organisations. Instead, there will be a vague compromise between the two biggest groups in this Parliament. In order that this House should not come to any unambiguous decisions, a great deal is to be immediately put in the hands of the Court of Justice, which may well promptly opt in favour of the highly-controversial country-of-origin principle. Those of us here who are members of the Socialist Party of the Netherlands have had no hand in this compromise. Although we vote to reject it outright, we will, until such time as the directive enters fully into effect, support all proposed amendments that the trade union movement regards as improvements. In the meantime, the struggle goes on; we, together with the trade union movement, will resist all attempts by the bosses at making it possible for people to be employed for lower wages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today saw the adoption by this House, by 395 votes to 215, of a ‘compromise’, cobbled together by social democrats and conservatives, which can be described as more than disreputable. The social democrats had already made enough disgraceful concessions to the conservatives, but, just before the end, they made another one, the consequence of which was that the directive would continue to apply to ‘social policy’ and ‘consumer protection’, just as the freedom to provide services already did to ‘services of general economic interest’. This is quite utterly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The text as adopted has ended up being not merely a licence for social dumping in Europe, but also a slap in the face for trade unionists, for campaigners for social justice, and for all those who, over recent days, weeks and months, have taken to the streets to express their opposition to the Bolkestein directive. The conduct of the German Social Democrats has been particularly shameful, in that they – unlike their French counterparts – were unswervingly loyal to the Bolkestein directive and sent their own natural supporters as lambs to the slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">Only now, though, is the fight against the European social dumping directive getting underway.

The Services Directive is designed to remove the obstacles to two of the freedoms that have formed part of the EC Treaty since 1958: freedom of establishment for suppliers of services, and freedom of movement for services. The potential for the trade in services is huge, and Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from an efficient market for services.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the Services Directive has been wide-ranging. Swedish and European trade unions point out that the directive contributes to ‘social dumping’. That is not the case, because the directive does not deal with issues relating to labour law. The labour law aspects have, moreover, been clarified by Parliament’s decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see a constructive Services Directive that clears away administrative rules and other barriers to trade. I also want the scope of the directive to be as broad as possible. I therefore voted in favour of areas such as private health care, temporary agencies and services of general economic interest being covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's decision by Parliament is based partly on a broad compromise. Compromises are seldom perfect but are often necessary if the objective in question is to be achieved. I hope that the EU Member States are successful in taking a decision on the issue later this year so that we might make progress on this very important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, it must be illegal to shout 'fire' in a cinema or to directly provoke racial hatred. I find it difficult to understand, on that basis, how Nick Griffin, the leader of the neo-fascist British Nationalist Party, was acquitted of promoting racial hatred earlier this month after his comments on both Islam and the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I am not sure I see the Danish cartoons that were published falling into that category. They were certainly offensive to many, but that does not mean they meet the same test as promoting racial hatred. Certainly, when I see opposition to their publication coming from the fundamentalist Christian right in Europe, I start to worry that the laws of blasphemy are being dusted off again across Europe. The correct position would have been not to forbid publication, but to condemn the content of many of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mr Frattini's 'code of conduct' for journalists, it deserved the decision it received. Yet if we are going to protect people's deep-rooted beliefs from ridicule, attack or insult, maybe some of Britain's yellow tabloid press can start to respect my anti-racism, my hatred of homophobia, my socialism and my commitment to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly alarming is the fact that the major powers in the EU are moving closer to the ambitions of the USA in the region.

Liberal democracy has proved unable to impose the rule of law on the Muslim communities in Europe or any respect for religious freedom on Muslim states. Instead, by making freedom of speech an absolute, it has managed to cause affront to the religious sensibilities of Muslims. Freedom without responsibility inevitably leads to conflict, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for national and religious sensibilities provides the basis for respecting the people who express them, irrespective of whether we agree with these views or not. These sensibilities must not, therefore, be offended by blasphemous representations of the cross, of Mohammed or of the victims of the Holocaust. Mr Cohn-Bendit is not right in claiming that religions become ‘de-religionised’ in the public sphere. Religion will always be different from political debate, unless, of course, it stops being a religion and becomes an ideology. A cartoon depicting Mr Cohn-Bendit is not the same as a cartoon depicting Mohammed.</p>

I wish to stress that this does not, in any way, involve relations between countries but, rather, relations between people belonging to the Muslim or Catholic faiths. The Jewish community was forced to flee the country at the start of the conflict and never became involved in it. A further peculiarity is that when the country came into being, most of the orthodox community lived in rural areas, whereas most Muslims lived in the cities. We ought to bear this in mind when we draw up EU aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome Article 16 of the Resolution, calling for more attention to be paid to the special needs of rural areas. It is also high time to call on the Hague Tribunal to start pursuing those war criminals that were motivated by reasons other than religious belief. In the terminology used here, we are talking about the Serbs. We must admit that even this Parliament has sometimes failed to reach a just conclusion. For example, some passages of the Resolution before us, regarding the tenth anniversary of the events in Srebrenice hold only one side culpable of mass murder, in contrast with the established facts.</p>

The era of Turkish rule was to the benefit of the Muslims in the centre and North-West who regard themselves as the real Bosnians; the Roman-Catholics in the South-West, who call themselves Croats, did well for themselves under Austrian rule; and the Yugoslavian era benefited the Orthodox in the North and East, who describe themselves as Serbs. Bosnia was disbanded as an administrative unit in the 1920s and re-established after the Second World War as a mixed area in the centre of the federal state that was intended to help integrate the different peoples within Yugoslavia, of which it was itself a miniature version. That proved a complete washout. During the 1992-1995 war, each of those groups made unilateral attempts to impose their own wishes. Dayton was a panacea intended to provide peace and reconciliation, and, whilst it is an inefficient and costly structure, it was born from the need for conciliation between widely diverse aspirations, and so, despite all its flaws, it should not simply be discarded, but should instead be used to build a federal structure in which all can live sustainably in peace with one another. The people must be able to choose freely rather than being told what to do by Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time for the European Union significantly to support the projects based on the forest-wood sector in relevant geographical areas. The link between a forestry strategy and rural development must be established and, while we are on the subject, I regret that mountain areas should not have been singled out for attention. Equally, and this in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the Union must take a greater interest in supporting research programmes linked to the use of wood, for example in the construction and energy sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a study, as a precursor to action, should be conducted on the transportation of wood, which is a heavy product, so as to provide some coherence between forests, areas of consumption and road, rail and maritime transport infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As someone who lives in one of the last important remaining oak forests in England, I am acutely aware of the need for sustainable forest management. Forests have a multi-functional role. In the Forest of Dean, the forest provides a beautiful environment and a natural habitat, opportunities for recreation and tourism, potential for work and industrial realities, as well as a home for people to live in. And yet, in the majority of cases, the multi-functional role, measured against the potential it offers, is not reflected in the economy of the areas concerned or in the income of their inhabitants. Rural development policy is the main instrument for implementing the forestry strategy at Community level and I support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should have liked the European Parliament to have stated that the objective was for forestry policy to remain an area for national decision-making. We met with a certain amount of sympathy for this view in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety during the discussion of this report. Unfortunately, however, the majority of the European Parliament has, in accordance with its usual obsession with doing everything on an abnormally large scale, prepared a report which, for example, will cause the sector-specific Community policy and the Lisbon Strategy to have an impact on forestry and which recommends that an ‘objective report [be] drawn up to examine the scope for creating a separate legal basis for forests’ in the EU’s Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We decisively reject such shifts in the political statements made by the European Parliament. It should be explained once and for all that forestry policy is an area in which decisions are to be taken purely and simply on a national basis.
