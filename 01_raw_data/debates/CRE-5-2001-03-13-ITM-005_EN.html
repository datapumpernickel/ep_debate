Progress on the directive and framework decision setting common penalties for facilitating entry and residence in the EU will be on the agenda at that Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was the UK Minister responsible for carriers' liability and other immigration issues, I always found that although the UK had strict rules on carriers' liability the system itself was open to criticism for being to some extent unbalanced and unfair. Some carriers were exempt from attention and in the EU as a whole the discrepancies between the way different nation States treated this issue led to loopholes and weaknesses in what should be an area of cooperation and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the burden-sharing was clearly unfair, we have an opportunity here. The French Presidency took the initiative but I hope my report has improved upon that initiative in a way that will be seen to be fair and reasonable in dealing with what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem.</p>
<p class="contents">My report ensures that carriers' liability extends to all transport to the EU of third-country nationals who are undocumented. That is fair and, although individual carriers' groups will be upset that there should be any liability at all, if it is spread across all the responsible carriers it will help them all.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, however, that the responsibility of carriers should be limited. Some have suggested that they should actually be required to retransport the people they have carried or remedy the situation. That would be draconian and excessive. Carriers should, of course, report the matter to the police or other appropriate authorities, who would then take the necessary steps.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only fair that, if an individual is subsequently granted asylum, the penalty on the carrier should be repaid. That has not been the case up to now but it is included in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point is that penalties must be approximated throughout Europe. At present some countries have no penalty whatsoever, some impose a very small fine and in some countries the fines are perhaps too penal. Approximating the fines will help to stop this activity and make people work together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we deal with this matter. Carriers must not be left alone; the authorities have responsibilities too. We wish to be humanitarian but this is an issue that can and must be dealt with by the EU as a whole. On that basis, I commend my report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union governments committed themselves to this in the Tampere conclusions and it also requires the necessary cooperation of the countries of origin and especially operators involved in the transport of passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is how to harmonise the various legislation of the Member States and to seek formulas for approximation. There is no doubt that transporters have to take on the obligation to verify whether foreign nationals meet entrance requirements. The formula proposed by the present initiative to establish a minimum fine of no less than EUR 5 000 per person transported does not seem unreasonable. We should also, however, impose the confiscation of vehicles used by transporters, not merely as a possibility but as a mandatory penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems necessary to ensure that the transportation of people who may be eligible, under the Geneva Convention, to apply for asylum, should not be punishable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in summary, the Union’s governments should make the greatest possible efforts so that transporters, border police and customs police fulfil their obligations in a duly coordinated fashion, and prevent mafia networks from trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only way to combat illegal human trafficking. We must share responsibility for this serious problem which the whole of European society is obliged to confront.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgent, ladies and gentlemen, that this initiative, which we have been discussing for several months, should become reality as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I acknowledge the difficulties we know he has faced during his work on this initiative. But this lack of a clear approach and these difficulties which Mr Kirkhope has experienced, have largely been due to the lack of clarity and the changes which the Council has introduced into the text, confirming that there is no unanimity on this issue. This makes work very complicated, not only for Mr Kirkhope, but for the whole of this House and, of course, for those of us in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs who have tried to improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that the European Council, at its meeting in Tampere of October 1999, as we all know, agreed that the different but closely related issues of asylum and immigration require the creation of a European Union common policy, and elements were established which should include cooperation with countries of origin, a common European asylum system, the fair treatment of nationals of third countries and the management of migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">Also highlighted was the need to adopt a broad focus on the management or regulation of migration flows, including political issues, human rights issues, development issues and, of course, the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking, which involves the countries of origin and of transit.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I believe it is essential, not only in the case of this initiative, but of others which we are going to deal with next today, and of those which we are no doubt going to continue debating over the coming years, that the European Union adopt clear and fair principles which, of course, comply with the United Nations Geneva Convention of 1951.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s response to illegal immigration should not be restricted exclusively to strictly controlling it. We must not shirk our responsibilities for defending and promoting human rights. These rights must be reflected in this initiative. We must regulate migratory flow through all the mechanisms at our disposal, but we must accept that a sufficient number of people can be received so as to prevent illegal immigration and eliminate the mafias that control it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind this House of Article 31 of the Geneva Convention, which states that there must be a real and well-founded fear of persecution in order to justify illegal entry into the territory of a country of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">In these cases, such people may use false documents as the only way to escape from imminent threats to their life or freedom. We must therefore guarantee that carriers are exempted from penalties in relation to asylum seekers with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to improve the management of migratory movements within a framework of close cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit, stepping up the fight against this type of immigration and combating the criminal elements involved, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that this text presented by the Swedish Presidency does not offer any real progress in relation to the initial text of the French initiative. Unfortunately, the reality of immigration requires global, coherent and coordinated initiatives and not one-off actions, like this one, which is limited to implementing Article 26 of the Schengen Agreement. It is essential that we safeguard the institution of asylum. We must exempt carriers who transport foreign nationals from penalties, if those foreign nationals then seek asylum once arriving in the receiving country, even if the request is subsequently rejected. Nor can we oblige carriers to examine the motives of the asylum seeker and thereby perform the role which falls to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore deemed it necessary to request the withdrawal of the present text in the hope of achieving a better initiative, which would contribute to the creation of a real Community policy on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is to crack down on the smuggling of human beings as an element of organised crime. There is broad consensus that we need to make every effort to prevent the systematic organisation of illegal immigration. All too often do we read and see accounts of human beings being treated in a most degrading manner. The example of the Dover Chinese has left us all with a sick feeling in our stomachs.</p>
<p class="contents">The other element is the right to asylum. People who escape poverty, misery or war cannot be blamed for their actions. What would we do in the same situation? Europe has always adopted a humanitarian stance, and it should stay that way. In other words, we must strike a balance between upholding the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees on the one hand and cracking down on crime on the other. In this respect, another factor comes into play with regard to this proposal. Today’s proposal is not about whether we should or should not introduce penalties for carriers. All Schengen countries have had such a scheme in place for many years and apply it. But the non-Schengen countries too, such as Great Britain, as stated earlier by the rapporteur, and Canada, for example, apply similar penalty mechanisms. Today’s proposal only aims to harmonise these penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the ELDR Group is of the opinion that these two factors must be brought into closer harmony with each other. That is why we have tabled Amendment No 11 by Mr Watson and Baroness Ludford, on the basis of which this penalty scheme does not apply if a person is seeking asylum. We hope that this amendment will be adopted and therefore consider the harmonisation to be acceptable as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, my group has a number of concerns: we must avoid a situation where the innocent become the victims, namely carriers and freight carriers in general. They are often under heavy social pressure, must adhere to certain times and are sometimes oblivious to the fact that they are transporting people.</p>
<p class="contents">Carriers may be middlemen in the criminal network, in which case they should be penalised for the trafficking in, and smuggling of, human beings. But they can also help combat the criminal network by reporting the fact that there are people being transported in their lorries illegally. However, the carrier may also be a taxi driver who picks up people in Sangatte or the centre of Calais, for example, and takes them over the border. Should he perhaps check their documents?</p>
<p class="contents">Additional problems can occur for people who are in fact travelling with documents, but ones which are difficult to verify. Another scenario is of people hitching a lift and declaring that they will be seeking asylum, but not doing so immediately and disappearing underground. I would like to be clear about who will be checking all these documents in future. In my opinion, there are not enough people available to check all documents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is a proposal which not only ignores the disease but also exacerbates both the symptoms and the disease. The idea, of course, is that it should act as a deterrent, but I should like to know whom it is imagined will be deterred. Whom is it imagined will be intimidated by this proposal? Those who think it will act as a deterrent are the humanitarian organisations, church people and those who have their hearts in the right place and who have to account for where their money comes from and how they use it. Whom is it imagined will profit from this? It will be the Mafia and other unscrupulous people.</p>
<p class="contents">Take a country like Afghanistan which is now almost surrounded by closed borders. Pakistan does not want to take any more refugees. There is no room for more camps in the locality, as some of us call it. The camps cannot hold any more people, but there are always people who are obliged to become refugees, and they have to pay to get out. Whom do we want them to pay? The Mafia, or the church and humanitarian organisations? If we increase the penalty, then we see the price rise. People who have to become refugees will pay dearly for the proposal we are discussing now. A heavier penalty will also mean that there will be fewer suppliers in this market. Fewer people will offer to help future refugees. Those who remain will be the Mafia. They will be able to charge their own price, and they will eventually have a monopoly over this area. I understand that there are Member States which are very worried about this proposal. I understand that the Swedish Presidency is alarmed by it. I would urge them very strongly to use their right of veto in the Council and put a stop to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would recommend that, in the discussion of the proposal, at least two things are ensured. Firstly, a distinction should be drawn between organisations which intervene for money and for profit, and organisations which do so for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. This distinction crucially determines the situation into which we put refugees. Secondly, I think that it is important that we do not pass on our responsibility to just any old carriers. It cannot be right for some employee of Sabena, Air France or SAS to be made responsible for assessing what should happen in an asylum case. That is our own responsibility.</p>

Organised crime gangs with vast resources at their disposal are operating with impunity. We need more international cooperation between law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that in some countries politicians and the police are profiting from people-trafficking and tipping traffickers off when operations are about to be mounted against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the issues being debated this morning, such as immigration, temporary protection for displaced persons and the level of harmonised penalties to be imposed on carriers transporting people without the necessary documents, are bound up with this dark world of conflict and criminal opportunism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last ten years there has been an unprecedented rise in forced and voluntary migration worldwide. The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo and elsewhere led to sudden large population movements and the need for temporary protection. At the same time, asylum issues are growing in importance. Last year 390 000 people applied for asylum in the European Union. The United Nations estimates that the modern slave trade is now worth GBP 5 billion and 10% of illegal entrants to Europe come via the Balkan route.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UNHCR my own country, Ireland, came third in Europe after Slovenia and Belgium in the number of asylum seekers it received last year, compared to the size of the total population. Asylum seekers in Europe were mainly from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan. The number of applications from Iranians more than doubled. These people do not get the welcome in Ireland that one would expect, especially considering our own history of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">It must reluctantly be said that the Irish have been less than generous in their acceptance of the population movements affecting them. It is a new phenomenon to us, but it saddens me to see people that I believed to be decent and compassionate acting in a racist and xenophobic way – and that includes many of the people in my own constituency. I say that with deep regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the considerations expressed by Mrs Cerdeira, Mrs Sörensen and Mrs Frahm and by the last speaker appear to be well-founded, but in order to be able to evaluate the report and the proposal, we need to take into account a question of principle, and that is that we have reached the point where we are going to have to resort to fragmentation on the issue of immigration policy, for otherwise we would have to admit, or rather the Council, above all, would have to admit that it is unable to regulate this phenomenon or rather that it failed to predict what might happen, that it failed to prevent it and that it is still unable to regulate it through government proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are bombarded by proposals from the Council and the individual Member States which, on the one hand, say they want to create a common, overall immigration policy while, on the other hand, they are integrating and harmonising areas of repressive law, without defining in any way the contents and criteria which will be – or rather which ought to be – at the basis of the future European immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not feel that the report and the proposal in question can make any contribution to the quest for an immigration policy; on the contrary, in our opinion, it is precisely these proposals which contribute to events such as the Dover incident, where human lives were lost.

The idea is to prevent illegal immigration attempts from the very outset – as a rule in the person’s home country. At present, carriers are indirectly encouraging illegal immigration in that no checking of travel documents is carried out. An attempt to enter illegally cannot be detected by the border authorities until the point of arrival in a Member State of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A simple and efficient solution is being proposed here by the Commission. The carriers should check on departure whether passengers have the necessary travel documents or visas and, if need be, refuse to carry the people concerned. To guarantee that these checks are carried out and at the same time take steps to discourage people from knowingly abetting illegal immigration, uniform fines should be introduced in the EU. This is the only way to ensure a common and coherent stance as regards illegal immigration. The proposal that the fines should be waived if a request for asylum is made, however, is counterproductive, since as a rule asylum is almost always requested. For this reason, the fine imposed on the carrier should only be refunded if the request for asylum is subsequently granted.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly reasonable to expect carriers to check the documents required for entry into the destination country along with their travel tickets or flight tickets. This must be made to apply to all types of passenger carriers, including railway companies. The carrier cannot, on the other hand, be expected to take charge of passengers’ return transportation. This should be handed over to the national police or other appropriate authority. This is the only way to ensure that the persons concerned are really returned in a proper manner. A criticism that may be levied at this proposal too, however, is that important aspects of a common policy on immigration and asylum should be considered within the framework of an overall concept and not sneaked into the legislative process prematurely as individual measures.</p>

As some speeches have demonstrated, these responses are dangerous because they offer false and apparently simple solutions to problems which are real and complex.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these types of proposal – and we shall see more in the course of the morning – are completely unviable without a global framework which implements the decisions of the European Council in Tampere. It must implement all of them, as the Commission is trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s tendency to introduce repressive aspects, when the reference frameworks for an essential common immigration policy are still not clear, is a problem, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has presented us with a document which intends to deal with the problem of human trafficking. I would like the Commission to also provide us with a document which defines both human trafficking and common penalties, and that this should fall within the framework of a common immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are going to penalise carriers who carry people lacking the appropriate documents. This is good. All traffickers in human beings know that they are committing a crime. Absolutely all of them know it. I do not believe, however, that we are going to stop them through this kind of measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the rapporteur’s position on this issue, because our committee has normally shown a degree of unanimity in not accepting this kind of proposal. Furthermore, with regard to this one, I have certain particular concerns which have been expressed here: the increased responsibility for control on the part of private individuals, and the serious and real problem of refugees. I do not believe that carriers are guardian angels and they are not going to accept the possibility of penalties when they are helping people who are truly in danger. I think we should bear this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my group has therefore decided, by majority, to request the rejection of this proposal and for the French and Swedish Presidencies to ask the Commission to present a global proposal on a future common immigration policy for the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is a back-door privatisation of immigration procedures and, as others have said, it passes the responsibility for checking documents to check-in staff or drivers rather than leaving it with official immigration staff who should be well trained in a non-racist and humane way. It is a pity that this service was left out of the Article 13 anti-discrimination directive by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I object strongly to the backing-winners approach of ‘your money back’ if you have transported a winner in the asylum-seeking stakes. Like others, I also believe that this is an initiative which is wrong in pragmatic terms, being part of a piecemeal approach to creating a common immigration policy, which we have seen far too much of in this House already. We must have the framework first and then look at how it is best implemented and whether such harmonisation is appropriate. This fragmented approach is neither coherent nor sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would commend to the House the amendment which has been supported by three groups: Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 13. There are other amendments to this report also worthy of consideration. I shall be supporting Amendment No 12. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The obligation laid down in the Schengen Convention to return passengers, a practice that has failed and has quite rightly been condemned by church and human rights organisations, is to be extended and tightened. Airline staff are already being forced into the role of auxiliary police as a result of it. The Member States are simply creating the conditions that guarantee the profits of the gangs that engage in human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">If carriers who fail to meet their so-called obligations will in future be expected to pay a fine of up to EUR 5 000, one can imagine where this will lead. The EU will become even more of a community of closed doors. This is surely not the way in which we want to deal with refugees and immigrants in future. More than 2 000 people lost their lives last year on the external borders of the Union, according to the estimates of the anti-racist human rights organisation UNITED. This is a situation that is intolerable in the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to go down the road of common European framework legislation in matters relating to asylum, then we must also see to it that asylum-seekers are able to come to us. Otherwise, any directive, even one that is formally based on the Geneva Convention on refugees, is not worth the paper it is written on and fundamentally violates the spirit of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to conclude with a remark about my own country. Unfortunately, the German Interior Minister today is one of the most important protagonists for a European policy of closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Germany is blocking efforts in almost all areas to make refugee and immigration policy more humane. Every proposal from the Commission that moves in this direction is rejected by the German Interior Minister. A proposal like the one we have before us on the table today would undoubtedly be supported without reservation by Mr Schily, since he breathes the spirit of defensive measures and tightened controls.</p>

I believe that we are all in agreement as regards this and that there is no need to argue about it. However, I think we also agree, on the other hand, – and Mr Kirkhope especially, as a former British Home Affairs Minister, will agree with me here – that we will ultimately not achieve very much with all these individual measures and that we are dealing with an area in which we are not seeking to solve the basic problems but, by taking small steps, at least to achieve something.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the case, then it is also clear that our discussion must be as free from ideology as possible. If we also agree, then, that we want an ideology-free discussion and we know that illegal immigration can never, in fact, be completely prevented – in other words, there will always be illegal immigration, no matter what happens – then, of course, we have to admit that we can ultimately achieve very little with penalties for carriers alone. If we are in agreement about this too, then we must also acknowledge, Mr Kirkhope, that if we want to do something, then we have to engage in discussions with the carriers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I am currently engaged in discussions with representatives of the international transport trade unions and I think there is still room for finding common ways forward on this. But when one speaks with these companies, Mr Kirkhope, one realises that your proposals are not at all helpful and that they attempt to frame the French initiative, which itself was already rejected by the carriers, even more restrictively. At this point, I ask myself why we are dealing at all with a report that no one supports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not everything that is illegal is also illegitimate. We have spoken a great deal here today about crime. In my opinion, however, it is not a crime to help needy people who wish to enter the EU actually to do so, simply because this is illegal; the crime is the closed-doors policy of the EU. This is acknowledged even by the UNHCR. In a study of those who traffic in human beings, the UNHCR found that the problem lies with the fortress policy of the EU and that the only way to change this situation is to open the borders further, not to introduce measures against the so-called smugglers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second problem that I would like to raise in connection with this report, which wants to call the carriers to account to a greater extent. In Germany this has led to racist behaviour, and has even led the authorities to call upon taxi drivers to behave in a racist manner. They have said that you can tell if someone is illegal or not when he is standing on the German-Polish border and wants you to provide him with transport; taxi drivers themselves have no powers to check these people’s papers. They have been told that these people are easy to recognise! No human being is illegal, and one cannot possibly tell whether or not a human being is in an illegal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point that has made me very sceptical is that, at the time when there were still two Germanies, the GDR and the FRG, in the 1970s, Germany’s supreme court reached a decision stating that people smuggling was legitimate, in other words exactly what I was talking about, and that it was even legitimate to demand money for this. Commercial assistance to refugees, therefore, which you are more or less criminalising here, was at that time highly commended. This makes me fear that the whole issue is being exploited, that we do not dare to take action against the refugees and those who have been made illegal, and therefore need new victims. This is why you are seeking out those who assist refugees, irrespective of whether or not they are being paid. It is they who need our support so that more people are able to cross the border cheaply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These debates in Parliament on initiatives from Member States are somehow incomplete because there is a piece missing. The author of the initiative does not take the floor and does not address the arguments of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, I must tell you very frankly, is in a very awkward situation in these debates because we are not the authors of these initiatives. We do not even have the right to present an amended proposal, we just participate in the debate. So, it is difficult for the Commission to take the floor and defend the proposal, or attack the proposal, because, up to a certain point, we are sidelined in this debate. Of course, I share your concern that a piecemeal approach is not the adequate way of addressing this very sensitive issue of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to give some support to a coordinated and integrated approach to illegal immigration and to immigration as a broader issue but we need to address the initiatives that Member States raise such as the current one. Therefore the Commission will confine itself to three main remarks. The first, which perhaps is a pure truism, is that the issue of carriers' liability is a very complex and sensitive one. Like some of the previous speakers, the Commission thinks that carriers' liability may be an efficient tool in fighting illegal immigration but the effectiveness of carriers' liability depends to a large extent on a well-balanced approach. Such a well-balanced approach is extremely difficult to achieve because it is necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of all sides, not only the Member States but also the persons in need of humanitarian protection, and the interests of the transport industry. Your discussion this morning and the discussion that is going on in the Council have shown that it is extremely difficult to strike a balance which is acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that we are privatising the fight against illegal immigration. I must say that I see it very differently. I think that the management of immigration falls within the responsibility of Member States, of public authorities, but we have to call upon civil society to be engaged in the management of immigration. This broad concept brings not only the responsibility of carriers but also the commitment of NGOs into the common management of immigration policy. So, we have one strict criterion to analyse the French proposal. The initiative should be welcomed if it provides added value to the already existing provisions of Article 26 of the Schengen implementing convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft we are considering today is only a first step. In the long run it will be necessary to go further and look coherently at all means of transport including freight transport. Therefore, the Commission, for its part, will assume its responsibility on this issue and we will try to prepare the ground in close cooperation with all interested parties for a more harmonised European approach. We think that we will be able to bring along a proposal covering all means of transport and built upon close cooperation with humanitarian organisations, with the carriers themselves, and, of course, with law enforcement agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
