It is not only the lack of good will; difficulties with the subject matter and different priorities also sometimes make working with the Council rather a trial.</p>
<p class="contents">All the more reason then for me to be glad today as rapporteur that everything has gone smoothly with Eurojust. We have acted in concert and made good progress in the fight against serious cross-border crime. I should like to express my thanks for this, in a personal capacity and on behalf of Parliament, but especially on behalf of the people who live in the European Union. If Eurojust starts work at the beginning of 2002 and supersedes the provisional unit to combat serious forms of organised cross-border crime, the public will have reason to be glad. This is because Europe will then have moved considerably closer to being an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The public also expect this of us, and I am convinced that they even have a right to it. That is why I should like to thank warmly colleagues in the committee who have helped to improve the Council initiative and make it more tangible. By so doing we want to create a judicial coordination unit which is as effective as possible and which works closely with the institutional partners, such as Europol, and the European Judicial Network. I would ask Parliament to vote in favour of the amendments and additions to the Council proposal which are necessary to achieve this. Allow me to give just a few examples from the Eurojust proposal where the hand of the European Parliament is visible.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the extended and clear-cut list of Eurojust's areas of competence is very important. It incorporates the essential features of my ideal of a European public prosecutor and goes far beyond the minimal concept occasionally put forward, which is based on the belief that it is quite sufficient to protect the financial interests of the European Union. From the public's point of view if we had adopted this minimal concept we would definitely not have gone far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to vigorously tackle all forms of crime which the people of Europe, not without reason, fear today. The fight must target cross-border fraud, corruption and crimes against the financial interests of the European Community just as much as computer crime. Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters. Of course Eurojust's general responsibilities must also include all of the other forms of crime and offences in respect of which Europol, as a police authority, is competent to act, including such dreadful crimes as trafficking in human beings or terrorist acts, which we have to read about every day in the newspaper.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have added a recital on data protection. In my view this was also absolutely essential because the rule of law does not cease to apply in the fight against international and organised crime. This means that Eurojust must also submit to strict rules on data protection when pursuing all of its investigative activities. When collecting, processing and using personal data the international rules of the Council of Europe and the individual rules of the Member States apply equally in each case. Rules on data protection must also be observed unreservedly when personal data are exchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to ensure that Eurojust is able to work as flexibly as it possibly can. This is a fundamental prerequisite for success. Direct and uncomplicated contact between those involved is particularly important. That is why we have deleted the national correspondents from the proposal and removed anything which might foster the growth of bureaucratic hurdles.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to say that the Belgian government has announced that it wishes to complete the preparations for the definitive Eurojust unit during its presidency. With this undertaking and the agreement of Parliament on my report – which I earnestly request – Europe is striking a powerful blow against international crime.</p>

This is a relatively short period of time if you compare progress in other areas of European policy. In Parliament we have been very positive towards this rapid progress and have taken an active interest in it. After Europol, the creation of Eurojust is a further important step towards combating organised cross-border crime in Europe more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step in the judicial area, namely setting up the European Judicial Network, has already been a success. With the help of this network, for example, the public prosecutor in the German town of Celle was, within the space of a few hours, able to deploy an undercover detective from Belgian customs and, together with public prosecutors from another country, carry out an observation operation in a third country, again within the space of a few hours. Thus many an opportunity to give mutual assistance – which was supposed forgotten – has been made to bear fruit. Problems remained, however, for example with interpreting conventions on mutual assistance, criminal law and criminal proceedings and with the division of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers. With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted. Eurojust has, first and foremost, a clearing function. The officials are to draft comparisons of laws, resolve bilateral disputes over the application and interpretation of conventions on mutual assistance, set priorities for fighting crime in Europe and monitor current transnational criminal prosecution measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, Eurojust will also have to keep lists of transnational investigations and be in a position to pass on this information; it will have to act as a registration point for information on serious offences and plan, coordinate and run training and development programmes. Through Eurojust, the national prosecution authorities will have access to reliable legal advice – without encountering language difficulties – and will be able to resolve transnational disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, for drafting Parliament's opinion, which is now to be put to the vote, and for the good level of cooperation. Alongside her amendments, there is one further amendment in particular to which I attach great importance. Until now, the judicial network has been a body without a head. If we are now setting up Eurojust to be the missing head then we are also obliged to provide shared nerve fibres, without which body and head will not function together. Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should not stand alongside each other or only enter loosely into contact with each other; they need to be bound together in one unit. This can be achieved by using the already existing contact points of the European Judicial Network instead of the proposed national correspondents for Eurojust. Only in this way can a superfluous juxtaposition of two systems with the same area of responsibility be avoided in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain. I should like to ask the Council to take account of these in its considerations. Then Eurojust really will be a success and make a contribution to the people of Europe living in greater security.</p>

Today we are discussing two important segments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The more important is precisely the creation of Eurojust, which has already been started off with the setting up of the provisional unit, which has prepared the ground for the definitive body.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will, I hope, approve the excellent report by Mrs Gebhardt and hence the proposed amendments intended to strengthen the role and effectiveness of Eurojust. They do in fact indicate its duties and the scope of its competencies in a broad enough way to avoid difficulties and uncertainties in its actions and thus to be able to better ensure the security of the citizens. They set out better the guarantees that fundamental rights will be respected, especially with regard to the right to a defence and the confidentiality of personal data, and not least they ensure the autonomy and independence of the body, as behoves its nature as a judicial body.</p>
<p class="contents">More effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a crucial element of the area of freedom, security and justice in order to face the challenge of crime in an area of free movement. However, in order to establish this cooperation in concrete form, the complexity of the procedures makes me hope yet again that in the next Treaty on the Union this matter too will finally become a Community matter, on a par with civil judicial cooperation, by means of the communitisation of the third pillar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That also applies, for example, to the network of consumer ombudsmen.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that we can all cooperate. We shall bring about practical results. As previous speakers have pointed out, it is important that the rules relating to personal protection are respected. I also want, however, to highlight an idea which Mr Watson has presented, namely that similar cooperation should be organised for those who have been accused and require a defence, so that everyone is operating on a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group fully supports the view that environmental crimes should be added to those crimes that are to be covered by this proposal. Unfortunately, we know that deliberate oil emissions are a significantly greater source of pollution than accidents. It is extremely rare for prosecutors to deal with these crimes. We therefore need Eurojust for cooperation in connection, for example, with my cherished Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled Amendment 28 because we have to respect the different ways in which preliminary investigations are organised. In certain countries, such as my own, the prosecuting authority is, in part, dissociated from the preliminary investigation. That must be respected, as it also was in the Tampere conclusions, which are the basis for our decision and discussion today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How, though, can we envisage effective operation of a unit which could become the future European public prosecutor’s office without prior harmonisation of Member States’ legislation and a basic rapprochement of their procedures? The purpose, for the Member States, is surely to achieve the highest possible standards, at the same time providing sufficient procedural guarantees and effective justice for all citizens, while respecting human rights, including the right to a defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, we have to recognise that today we are dealing with a body which is not subject to any European Parliament control. More serious still is the lack of all jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in accordance with Article 35 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to bear in mind concerns the processing of the data that the unit is responsible for. Eurojust will also have the task of collating information from police records, police reports and Member States’ registers. This gives rise to a few questions. What protection will be provided for this information? Who can access and use it? What right of reply and defence, indeed of correction of incorrect or out-of-date data is there?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the purpose of my amendments, on which our support for this report will depend. It is true, the European Union needs a supranational judicial structure to coordinate and enhance public action across the whole of European Union territory. The stakes are as high as they can be. That presupposes a willingness to implement a common crime policy which will go hand in hand with a minimum of national sovereignty being abandoned, whether the Member States want it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner. Its whole effectiveness will depend on the complementarity of the added value that the unit will be capable of bringing to the other players in the judicial and police worlds. So, what use is it to establish supranational structures? Why ensure complex coordination between different countries to centralise an investigation if the judge in charge of the case does not have the resources to complete his investigation or secure conviction of the people charged?</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, rather than having an endless epilogue on the possible powers of a real European party, surely it would be better to make a real decision on a structure which would distinguish itself by its rapidity, effectiveness, and availability to the citizens of Europe while giving them full guarantees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an institution with public prosecutors and judges from the Member States with the widest independent powers to prosecute and conduct investigations into so-called ‘serious cross-border crimes’, not that these crimes are described anywhere. It is an institution which will be able to circumvent national authorities in order to react instantly, which will be able to pluck a case from one Member State and give it – one wonders on the basis of what criteria – to another Member State. The right hand of Eurojust will be the Schengen system and Europol, which is promoted to the status of institutional partner. Provision is also made for the European judicial network to be maintained, while Eurojust will create its own database, that is, there will be four networks with sensitive personal data for the criminal records, four means of filing information on citizens and anyone who enters the portal of the authoritarian fortress called the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-vaunted operational independence of the justice system, which civil democracy was so proud of, has been sidelined. Eurojust and the future European public prosecutor are the finishing touches to a suffocatingly centralised, unaccountable, nightmarish structure for each and every citizen and, more importantly, for the grass-roots movement.</p>
<p class="contents">As we watch the European Union march towards unification, we note the trend towards full liberalisation of the market on the one hand, that is, the complete unaccountability of the monopolies in their quest for profit, and the authoritarian centralisation of institutions, the growing militarism of the European Union and suppression, on the other. The people of the European Union must reverse this march and they will. This is clear from events in my country, where the grass-roots movement and democratic powers in general have rallied and are resolutely opposing the new authoritarian and anti-democratic law on demonstrations which the government is currently trying to push through the Greek parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In approving the setting-up of Eurojust, I believe we would be adding a new weapon to take on Europe's criminal organisations. Organised crime in Europe has been at least ten steps ahead of us, taking advantage of weaknesses in our legal and economic systems. These criminals are experts in exploiting legal provisions and jurisdictions and they have taken full advantage of our open market. The European Union must no longer be a soft touch for serious crime. Traditional enforcement measures are no longer enough. National prevention measures must be complemented, where necessary, by appropriate action at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative specifies that it should include trafficking in human beings, and I wish to insist that this should also include the smuggling of illegal immigrants, prostitution rings and the sexual exploitation of children. In addition, we are talking about competence for dealing with acts of terrorism, protection of the euro, computer crime and protection of financial interests of the EU. It also extends to the laundering of proceeds of crime. Today in Brussels the EU Forum on Organised Crime is holding its first meeting. The Commission must keep us and the public informed of the results of such meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element. Let us make it known that the EU programme against social exclusion can be matched by the crime prevention strategy. Let us make it known that the Regional Fund can contribute to the national programmes, supporting initiatives to fight and prevent crime. Let us make it known that the Community's cooperation and assistance policies and programmes already extensively incorporate the fight against crime. Let us ensure that all new legislation is crime-proof and existing legislation is evaluated.</p>

<p class="contents">My friends and I have studied the issue of Eurojust in depth and frankly it deserves to be called ‘Euro Saint-Just’ instead, in view of the way this matter has come before us. I am told Saint-Just was a good lawyer too. Eurojust raises many questions, so I am glad Commissioner Vitorino is here.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice clearly rejected the principle of an independent public prosecutor. The countries do not want it, for all sorts of reasons. A prosecution system cannot be developed without at the same time developing a defence system, a data protection system, and a rights guarantee system. A bureaucracy will be created which will try to ask governments for criminal proceedings, when criminal proceedings are reserved for the judiciary. The rules on that vary from one country to another. In our country criminal proceedings are obligatory, but that is not the case in others. These are complex matters which, in my opinion, are not going to be improved by this ‘Euro Saint-Just’ which seems to me to be a bit like holding the inquisition at European level, if we do not build a parallel system of control and legality.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Commissioner, it makes me wonder when I think of the circumstances in which some countries have nominated their representatives – my country, for instance, which nominated Mr Caselli, in violation of rules laid down by the judiciary itself. It makes me wonder when my country sends you the procurator of Palermo, who brought charges against Mr Andreotti, Mr Muzotto and Mr Contrada, who has tried five cases on the basis of the revelations of penitents, and who lost five cases out of five – the people he charged were acquitted in court. I wonder where we will end up if these methods are exported to Europe. For pity’s sake, let us reject this ‘Euro Saint-Just’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the statistics are correct, developments in the crime sector are extremely alarming because in the European Union 30% of crime is already classified as international organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this trend we have to ask ourselves whether the border-free European Union is actually taking advantage of all the opportunities it has to take action against this organised crime. Where police cooperation is concerned we can say that substantial progress has been made. We have Europol, and Europol is working extremely successfully to fight crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of judicial cooperation, however, we must unfortunately note that here cooperation is still in its infancy. With Eurojust we now have a new instrument which will become operational in 2002 and will represent decisive progress in cooperation between the judicial authorities. In principle, then, Eurojust works like Europol. It coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must hope is that cooperation with existing units, with the judicial network and with Europol, works and that duplicate investigations are avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would congratulate the rapporteur. There is only one point on which I disagree with her. She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat. As an Austrian, who also knows that the enlargement of the European Union is at hand – and welcomes it – and that Vienna is moving closer to the heart of the European Union, I would make a counter-proposal and propose not Luxembourg but Vienna as the seat of this authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the area of freedom, security and justice, the creation of a Eurojust unit in the field is certainly a most promising leap forward. Eurojust is facing and trying to find an answer to one of the most serious, pressing threats to the rule of law: transnational organised crime, which is estimated to be worth a frightening amount in the world economy and, of necessity, in the European economy too. The nation states have shown abundant signs that the legal mechanisms they have are insufficient to tackle organised crime in a satisfactory way. Here, then, the European Union will have exceptional scope for affirming the principle of subsidiarity, for Eurojust is the democracies' necessary, indispensable response to the scourge of organised crime. Such crime has accompanied the growing interdependence of economies and technological developments, exploiting the weaknesses in national legal systems which turn their backs on each other, impotent victims of an anachronistic pretension to self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurojust and the inevitable European public prosecution service of the future confirm that European integration is a necessity for citizenship, a tangible response to tangible problems affecting the ordinary citizen. It is on the success of all the concerted action at judicial and police level that the future confidence of societies in their democratic institutions will largely depend. Eurojust will help preserve the effectiveness and prestige of these institutions and will render a great service to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Information, cooperation and joint coordination measures are the key to a new push forward in the fight against money laundering, the trafficking of human beings, environmental crimes, forgery and other serious offences. The proposed college is an innovative instrument essential to the pursuit of these objectives. However, for the rule of law to be strengthened as we would like with the creation of this important instrument of judicial cooperation, it is important that procedural guarantees, so important in domestic law, should also be worked into the operation of the Eurojust system so that the fundamental rights that these guarantees aim to preserve do not end up being diminished. In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on the thoroughness and quality of her report and, in particular, on the sense of balance which inspired the proposed amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aware of the enormous proportions that organised and cross-border crime has reached, requiring swift, common and concerted action particularly in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, child pornography, the trafficking of people, forgery of the euro, computer crime and money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Eurojust, I have four things to say: first, we should be pleased to be making progress in this matter. When the European Parliament gave its opinion on the provisional unit in November last year, we made a clear recommendation that the creation of this unit should not be a pretext for undesirably delaying the setting-up of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are taking one more step towards the creation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The Tampere decisions are moving ahead, making their way. Step by step, we are constructing a citizens’ Europe, with the Commission scoreboard, respecting the role of Parliament and with an initiative shared between the Commission and the Member States. Commissioner António Vitorino knows full well, however, that we have found more to our taste in his initiative than we have at times in the Member States’ initiative, as regards its coherence and comprehensive view.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are honouring the values of our civilisation, the principles of the rule of law: in Commissioner Vitorino’s fortunate expression, Eurojust is the judicial counterpart of Europol. Eurojust is to operate with appreciable independent status. Its annual report is to be placed not only before the Council but also before the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, data protection. Parliament has already drawn attention to this issue: Eurojust will have to cooperate with Europol, with the European judicial network, with OLAF and with the Schengen information system, in addition to benefiting from crime information supplied by the Member States. It is particularly important to find a solution that is balanced between guaranteeing and safeguarding citizens’ rights and freedoms, on the one hand, and the instruments needed to fight crime on the other. It is also always worth emphasising, when talking about the Community institutions, that we must make every effort to avoid any duplication of tasks or conflict of competencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission shares the overall view that Mrs Gebhardt presents regarding the Eurojust report and would like to congratulate her on the excellent job she has done. Above all, we stress the importance of finding suitable solutions for the relationship between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network, which has made a very important contribution to the development of judicial cooperation at European level, as well as defining the conditions under which the Commission itself and Europol can be associated with the work of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, the Eurojust unit has no powers to take operational decisions or to promote investigations as such or to take cases to court. Obviously, however, the natural course of evolution for Eurojust will be to arrive at this higher stage of judicial cooperation. Hence the importance of the ideas set out by Mrs Gebhardt, which the Commission recognises, regarding guarantees of a defence for the accused, the rules on data protection and global issues of safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. We all believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important guide in the adoption of these solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the suggestions made by Mrs Gebhardt, but there is just one point upon which I should like to express a reservation. One has to be very careful when defining the competence of Eurojust with regard to crime affecting the protection of the financial interests of the Communities. We feel it would be preferable to speak of competence in matters of economic and financial crime. One of the most sensitive questions is the relationship between Eurojust and OLAF. OLAF has competencies within the first pillar; Eurojust falls within the specific intergovernmental context of the third pillar; therefore we feel it would be best to avoid giving the idea that Eurojust always has to be involved in cases where OLAF takes the initiative to safeguard the protection of the Community’s financial interests. Thus, we feel it is very important to specify their different scopes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, with regard to the imaginative and creative figure of speech used by Mr Dell’Alba, who called Eurojust ‘Euro Saint Just’, I have to say that, for my part, I believe Eurojust is not an instrument of justice for saints: it is an instrument of justice for human beings. Aware of the difficulties, and even some risks, I say that, like any human endeavour, it is imperfect. It is not a holy office; on the contrary, it is a first step towards guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights and fighting crime at European level. Not perfect, but an essential first step. That is why I hope the House will support Mrs Gebhardt’s report.</p>

They are citizens who were working in Cabinda for Portuguese companies and were therefore totally uninvolved in the independence conflict which has been going on there for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, two of these hostages have been held for practically a year, I repeat, a year in captivity, and the other five for more than two months! The little news that reaches us indicates that the Angolan authorities are currently placing enormous military pressure on the territory and, in a parallel move, recently ordered the expulsion of all foreign journalists. We therefore do not know what is happening there, and there is a total lack of impartial witnesses in the field. Naturally we fear for the safety or even the lives of the hostages. The seriousness of the matter led me to write to the Council myself recently, to ask Mr Javier Solana to intervene. He would certainly have the opportunity to create favourable conditions for our compatriots to be set free, the primary objective of this speech. As I asked in my letter, Madam President – I ask you to make every effort within your competencies and to exert all possible diplomatic pressure on the kidnappers and the Angolan authorities so as to create a situation in which the seven hostages can be set free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
