<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Torres Couto </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today debating an extremely important subject for cooperation and development at European level. This debate concerns a recommendation for second reading, which I am presenting, on the general objectives of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in developing countries. The report by Mr Galeote Quecedo on the same subject but applying to third countries is also being considered in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Council"s common position, I must mention the following issues. The Council"s common position does incorporate – sometimes only in part or with changes – a number of the amendments made by Parliament at first reading on the basis of the report by its Committee on Development and Cooperation. However, I note with regret that the majority of the most important amendments proposed by Parliament have not at this stage been adopted by the Council. This applies in particular to the amendments relating to budgetary aspects, those linked to comitology – which, it must be stressed, are of key importance for Parliament – and those seeking to strengthen the procedures for informing Parliament and to give the draft regulation an unlimited duration.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as important as the amendments promoting democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are those aimed at extending the scope and objectives of the draft regulation to cooperation operations for promoting the proper management of public affairs. This is a vital aspect which has nevertheless not been accepted by the Council, and Parliament should take a determined stance on this because it is fundamental for development and healthy cooperation with developing countries. Regrettably, without any controls we must acknowledge that aid from the European Union is frequently lost due to corruption, warmongering and inappropriate management of the resources which we provide to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation has to be aimed at eradicating the hunger, poverty, misery and illness which are increasing at an alarming rate in most developing countries. This aid must not be used for more armoured cars, more weapons of destruction, more mines and more potential wars which simply decimate the defenceless civilian populations, thereby constantly attacking the human rights which we are trying to defend. Consequently, this premise must form a cornerstone of the EU"s policy for cooperation and development with the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also underline that the reasons which led the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the European Parliament to table their amendments at first reading are still as relevant and topical. In these circumstances, I take the view that all the amendments not accepted by the Council should be retabled at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also draw your attention to the importance of an amendment which I am tabling together with Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mrs van Bladel. This concerns the adoption by the Commission of measures needed to establish a code of conduct for partners involved in actions governed by this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also make a final political point on the following issue. The Community action for promoting human rights and democratic principles must respect the principle of the universality and indivisibility of human rights as these form the key elements of the international system for protecting human rights and the basis of European construction. In this respect, the European Union cannot have different levels of action and different measures according to whether the context is Kosovo, Africa or East Timor. We must end the hypocrisy which is rife and the idea that the economic interests at stake must prevail. I would highlight and strongly protest at the position of the German Presidency which is heavily involved in the military action in Kosovo. When international public opinion is told about the Indonesian Government which is carrying out terrible massacres in East Timor and is continuing to attack the basic rights of the Timorese population, it should also be told that the German Presidency, which is fighting Milosevic in Kosovo, is in favour of President Habibie in Indonesia. The German Presidency is stressing and supporting what it calls good governance and the process of democratisation which is being implemented in Indonesia. It is this type of duplicitous position and these double standards which frequently discredit the Union and ensure that international public opinion does not always understand the value of our measures and policies.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Galeote Quecedo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, today sees the culmination of a procedure which turned out to be longer and more complex than expected, due to the need to break down the Commission"s initial proposal into two texts according to the various geographical areas where Community cooperation action regarding human rights and the development of the rule of law and democracy might be called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in our capacity as rapporteurs for the two reports we set ourselves the task of processing both texts in as coordinated a manner as possible. In this way, we hoped to achieve one of Parliament"s key aims since the beginning: ensuring that when the two regulations were presented to the House, they would prove identical in content and would have the same aims and objectives, despite being officially divided into two separate regulatory texts. In this connection, it is important to mention that the texts we are considering today are the result of a broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, the operations we are studying today already have obvious quantitative significance. Since 1991, Parliament has been attempting to make this more evident by grouping together all the articles of the Communities" budget referring to the promotion of human rights and democratic principles in a single budget line, B7‐70.</p>
<p class="contents">These operations are much more significant from a political point of view, however. They involve a genuine European philosophy of support for the development and consolidation of the rule of law, the defence of democratic values and respect for the rights and freedoms of all people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main aim has been to strengthen a range of principles and criteria that are considered to be of fundamental importance for the promotion of a coherent, systematic and effective policy in this area. In brief, we have sought to guarantee appropriate planning and programming of operations to establish the Community"s priorities in these matters. We have also sought to strengthen the identity and visibility of Community actions, to establish well‐regulated, clear and uniform procedures for all those involved, and to ensure that the actions have a real and sustainable impact on the societies in which they are undertaken. Further, we have worked to facilitate better monitoring, to guarantee that the best possible use is made of the resources devoted to this end, and to ensure that our actions are coordinated as closely as possible with the Member States" policies and initiatives in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to dwell on the details of the significant procedural components of the regulation. It is suffice to say that every effort has been made to ensure that the procedures are as transparent and effective as possible and that they are adequately monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">I do however think that special attention should be paid to the changes proposed in order to introduce coordination instruments at all levels. In particular, I believe that the suggestions included in the proposal concerning cooperation with the Member States of the Union are most relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer specifically to the various proposals contained in the reports that have been approved in committee and that relate to the European Parliaments"s role in the development of programmes concerning human rights and democracy. In my view, Parliament"s role as outlined in the initial version of the proposal is clearly inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the proposal I am discussing today includes a range of significant amendments designed to ensure a valid role for Parliament in those procedures. To this end, specific measures have been introduced, including the plan to set deadlines for the Commission to complete its assessments and submit the results to Parliament. Commission communications are to be forwarded to the European Parliament, not just to the Member States. The Commission is to present an annual report to Parliament and this must include details of the implementation of the programmes for the previous financial year and of the programming and selection of the programmes for the current year. It must be submitted to Parliament in good time to allow Parliament to hold a full annual debate during the first half of the year and before it considers the relevant budget item in the general debate on the annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If these measures are incorporated into the text, they will provide for a substantial increase in Parliament"s control. Nevertheless, administration will not be affected and will remain the exclusive responsibility of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that all these proposals and suggestions enabled us to attain the objectives we set ourselves, not only in terms of studying and debating this particular regulation but also as regards the long‐term aim of this House, which, for years, has been striving to enhance and regulate Community cooperation aimed at promoting human rights and political freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust, too, that these arrangements, as presented to us today, will help us to establish new and more effective channels of cooperation with those who are engaged in a daily struggle to this end. Finally, I hope that all this will eventually result in the improvement of the Community"s procedures for managing and making use of resources.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virrankoski </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span><span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – (FI) </span>Mr President, Mr Galeote Quecedo has produced an excellent report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning strengthening the legal base for aid to promote democracy, the rule of law, and the reinforcement of human rights. The report relates to a Commission initiative which the Council divided into two some time ago. The other proposal for a regulation is on the agenda for second reading under the cooperation procedure and is the subject of a report by Mr Torres Couto. Mr Torres Couto"s report mainly concerns developing countries, and this report by Mr Galeote Quecedo relates to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets drafted similar opinions for both reports, with comments on funding frameworks, technical support and comitology. When the budget for 1998 was being debated, Parliament agreed that an advisory working party on human rights should be set up. Its purpose was to coordinate action annually, and it would comprise MEPs and representatives of the Commission and Council. We have had good results with a similar working party, <span class="italic">inter alia </span> within the framework of the MEDA programme. This working party would be treated in the same way as committees made up of Member States" representatives. The establishment of the working party was already proposed in Parliament"s opinion as set out in Mr Torres Couto"s report, but this was rejected by the Council, so the rapporteur is now proposing it again, and I support this. Unfortunately, the report we are now discussing by Mr Galeote Quecedo does not include these provisions concerning the working party, so Amendments 38 and 39 have been tabled on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. I support these amendments and I hope Parliament will adopt them, as they are consistent with the position Parliament has so often adopted in the past.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: MR COT<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Torres Couto </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. – (PT)</span> Mr President, thanks to the generosity of your predecessor I had five and a half minutes to present my proposal for second reading on this subject. So that my time now is not wasted, I will reiterate some points which I aimed to stress in my draft opinion on this matter and which, in essence, Mr Galeote Quecedo has already highlighted extremely well in his speech. Due to the coordination between the two committees and between the two rapporteurs, with all the political groups participating extensively in the work of the two committees – I had personal experience of this in the Committee on Development and Cooperation – it was actually possible to determine a whole range of proposals. These aim to reinforce the coordination, efficiency, transparency, rigour and control of the implementation of an instrument which is fundamental to the future development of the countries with which the European Union is aiming to strengthen its links, namely the developing countries and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This work therefore resulted in a combined effort and was carried out with a great sense of responsibility. We were even able to accept a range of very important proposals put forward by other political groups. For example, I must highlight the importance of the proposals put forward by Mr Telkämper on behalf of the Green Group involving measures to combat racism, xenophobia and sexism. I must also emphasise the proposals submitted by Members from the Group of the European People"s Party supporting initiatives to abolish the death penalty. Mention should also be made of the important role assigned by both documents to reinforcing the participation of new partners who may be able to act constructively in this area. In particular this participation of new partners will not be subject to any discrimination and in fact, on the contrary, will respect full and total pluralism in political, religious and social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">After a long process of negotiation on this subject, both in Council and in Parliament, I therefore believe that we have arrived at a final text which is highly encouraging for this House. Saying this, I must once again take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo on his excellent work. In particular he has made himself available so that we could work together constantly in order to combine our efforts and produce a document which would merit not only the widest approval of this House but also the acceptance of the Commission and Council. I must thank the political groups, in particular the Group of the European People"s Party, the UPE Group and the Green Group, which have all contributed in a decisive manner to the vast improvement of these documents. Congratulations, Mr Galeote Quecedo.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fernández Martín </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I have here the text of the speech I made on this report by Mr Torres Couto in December of last year. It would not be very sensible of me to read out again what I said at the time, but believe me when I say that it would be highly relevant to what we are discussing today. This is actually a good example of how the heavy burden of procedures prevents our parliamentary work from being as versatile and flexible as we would like.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly hope that today"s debate will be the last on this important matter. It is worth remembering that this is the fourth occasion on which we have debated the issue in scarcely four months, that is, since last December.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Torres Couto"s report has been debated at first and second reading. Mr Galeote"s report has been debated too. A further debate on my own report on the same issue took place in January. As was only to be expected, all the speakers tended to rehearse the same or similar arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that I did not discuss this previously prepared speech with Mr Galeote. However, in his own recent speech, Mr Galeote quite justifiably expressed his regret at the duplication of effort involved in a dual processing procedure for what ought really to be a single regulation for Community actions to finance cooperation and actions promoting human rights and democratic values in third countries and in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Torres Couto has also said today how much he regrets having to table exactly the same amendments today. The Commission had already stated that it accepted and supported these amendments, but in the end it was not prepared to include them in the regulation. Most of these amendments are also identical to those tabled by Mr Galeote.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are continuing to call for a new framework for the Union"s relations with the countries we are cooperating with. We wish to facilitate more effective and transparent actions in support of the rule of law and human rights which aim to prevent corruption and to enable civil society to play a greater role in the countries benefiting from European funds allocated to development and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this is not a good example of how to carry out a task efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">My parliamentary group has been active within the Committee on Development and Cooperation and has tabled amendments. We supported Mr Torres Couto"s report and I should like to reiterate my group"s support for it today. Nevertheless, I am most unhappy with the procedural arrangements. I am particularly concerned because, in actual fact, this does nothing to enhance our reputation.</p>

This is why the work done so far by Mr Torres Couto and the Committee on Development and Cooperation is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to speak in support of the amendments tabled, which restate the position of the European Parliament. Development cooperation must not only be geared to introducing that often general but important formula – the rule of law. Something more, something better is needed: a good administration, a fair legal order and proper judicial authorities – as referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, drawn up by the Council of Europe in whose building we are meeting – so that the general aim of assisting in the establishment of human rights does not amount to a rhetorical exercise. Europe's great merit is to have turned principles into reality. This must apply likewise to the developing countries.</p>

I think that a fine report has been produced here, thanks to some good cooperation in Parliament. For our group, in any event, it was very gratifying to see how well we worked together.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important report. It is about upholding or actually creating fundamental freedoms and democracy in order to promote respect for human rights. We can see how important this is in Europe at the moment: once again a war is being waged here. I think that a democratic state with the participation of the people is the only way in which peace can be created in the long term, as we have seen over the last 50 years in Europe. In the southern hemisphere, authoritarian regimes abound, as do aristocracies and regimes in which the people play no part. In this respect, it is right and necessary for us to support efforts to encourage a transition to democracy and respect for human rights there.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we can support this report more or less in full. We have not gone along with you on one point, Amendment No 1, the reason being that we did not want ‘proper management of public affairs" to be included – not because we are against it, but because the funding for this whole programme is so minimal that we need to focus our efforts. We need to focus on respect for human rights and promoting fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Three other amendments which you accepted were important to us, the first of which is to Article 2. Until now, the phrase on everyone"s lips has been combating racism. Fifty per cent of the world"s work is done by women. Women are particularly oppressed in these countries. The inclusion of the phrase on opposing a policy of sexism is important, and the Council really should accept it too, as it should accept this whole Parliament report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have two further points: it is important to support smaller non‐governmental organisations and smaller state‐run bodies, because they are the ones which have a multiplier effect.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that supplies and payments in kind from the countries to ...</p>

We would be well‐advised to ensure that they are adopted quickly, indeed very quickly, so that we finally have a regulation on the human rights policy. This policy is one of the most important conducted by the Union over the years but its bases have unfortunately been rather shaky. This, it should be said, has been due to the accumulated delays in regulating this issue, caused particularly by the Council. We must now seize this opportunity to reinitiate this policy on solid bases. We are currently well aware of the problems of many NGOs and of many people fighting for this cause and the EU would therefore be honoured to contribute to their financing. However, we can also see the difficulties posed in implementing these projects, particularly due to all the problems of which we are well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I listened closely to Mr Virrankoski"s speech. I have been assessing for some months and even years this idea of involving Parliament in administration or, in any case, in decision‐making on projects. Thankfully, we are sparing ourselves this prospect. This House has a duty which it has fulfilled more than ever in recent months. In particular it has complained about all the structures, all the TAOs and all the artificial creations which could hinder the action of the Commission in order to ensure that one body implements, a parliament scrutinises and a court of auditors or another institution audits and so on. We must not mix these tasks up but should keep them as they are. I am against the two amendments. I hope that my colleagues will follow the rapporteur"s opinion. I believe that what matters is being sensible and respecting the work of others.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lenz </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the two very thorough – and fortunately also well coordinated – reports by Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Torres Couto are an attempt by the European Parliament to adopt a position on the measures which are so important to us and which are intended, within the framework of Community policy, to contribute to developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. When this was first discussed, we said that we would have liked the measures on developing countries and third countries to be adopted on the same basis, so that the same article of the Treaty could be used as a legal base. But the Council insisted on different procedures: Article 130w for developing countries and Article 235 for third countries. Of course, this has more to do with the balance of power between the institutions than with a rational consideration of legal bases. This is comparable with the way in which portfolios are distributed in the Commission, which is illogical as far as human rights are concerned and is done instead on the basis of Commissioners" responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation which is urgently needed in these areas in both cases ultimately needs a solid foundation, however. That is why we also support this. This policy is becoming an increasingly significant part of Community policies – that has already been said here – and needs legal protection, as we know of course from the unfortunate experiences of recent months. However, promoting the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms is a need which we have already made a prerequisite – or wish to do so in the future – in the democracy programmes under PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, and also when granting financial aid to developing countries. We have introduced this into many cooperation agreements in the form of so‐called democracy and human rights clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">Our definition of human rights has not been dictated by Europe, but is based on conventions and definitions as they appear in texts ranging from the UN Charter to European Conventions. It is therefore not something which we have invented. It has helped us to have a period of stability and peace in the European Union, and this is what we want other countries to have as well. We also wish to have a solid basis for cooperation with the NGOs. The many examples mentioned in the report are precisely what we want to support. We therefore very much support the proposal to set up an advisory committee. We have already requested this in Parliament on more than one occasion. Certainly, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, but of course advising does not necessarily mean deciding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has rejected a whole series of amendments. The European Parliament should insist on these amendments if it wishes to strengthen its own role in the future. It is and remains the spokesperson for its own message and for the people who are hoping to see this become a dimension of their own countries" policies. I am pleased to note once again that our views are so similar where human rights, the principles of democracy and the rule of law are concerned.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lehideux </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the general principles in these two reports are broadly accepted by this House. They quite rightly encourage the Union to link these cooperation and development agreements with the improvement of respect for human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the proper management of public affairs by our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress this last point. Furthermore, I agree with the rapporteurs who are again proposing amendments which extend the draft regulations to measures to promote the proper management of public affairs. These amendments, previously adopted at first reading by Parliament, were not incorporated into the Council"s common position. This is to be regretted.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the Union must demonstrate humility and caution in these matters. Our partners may from time to time ask us for explanations about how judgments are passed on the internal situation of a particular country. The Union cannot give the impression that it preaches at everyone else but is not itself always irreproachable. The development in the right direction of the internal situation of certain countries is, in my opinion, more important than the excellence of a situation at a given moment. I therefore feel that, when passing judgment, we must take account of each country"s history right from its beginnings, rather than simply noting the situation at the specific time when we make these judgments. After all, true democracy has only recently been achieved in some European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I can cite two examples in this respect. The first one relates to Togo. In my opinion, the intellectual and political development of this country must be assisted by the Union which should, in order to do this properly and appropriately, resume in full its cooperation with this country. You will remember that this cooperation was suspended some years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">My second example is Cuba which we discussed a few weeks ago with Mr Galeote Quecedo. This country has been accepted within the ACP countries as an observer. The current developments in Cuba seem to me to be problematic and must be subject to the utmost rigour on our part.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> First of all, I should like to say that my colleague, Mr van den Broek, cannot be with us today. He is with the presidency on a troika mission to Kiev and he sends his regrets to the House. I would like to thank Parliament for its considerable efforts as regards both the time taken and the quality of its work in the process of adopting the future legal basis for the appropriations of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, an initiative launched in 1994 at your instigation.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I would like to thank the two committees and the rapporteurs. The amendments that were discussed in December are logically enough retained in the reports that are before us today. Please excuse me, therefore, for having to repeat some of the comments made at that time, even though the scope of the debate has broadened to include programmes for countries outside the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to accept most of the amendments as long as they do not call into question institutional roles. It supports proposals that are in harmony with its initial proposal dealing with the setting up of an advisory committee, doing away with the restrictions on the duration of the regulation's application and the abolition of the financial reference amount.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares the rapporteur's concern about the need to make provision to keep Parliament informed of the work of the committee and about emergency operations. However the Commission is hesitant about the idea of publicising the committee's discussions as it does not take account of the need for confidentiality inherent in project selection. The Commission's position is also qualified when it comes to the series of amendments calling for clarifications or adjustments, especially on the subject of strengthening of programmes, annual evaluations and the relative importance accorded to recipients' experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot support the references made to the interinstitutional working party. This would directly infringe on its management and implementation powers and could well render the regulations inoperable. Looking ahead, Parliament will have to decide on the committee structure by which it will take account of the human rights issues. I know there has been much heartsearching as to the best way to handle these issues. Whatever solution is adopted you can rest assured that the Commission will continue to look to Parliament as a key interlocutor, not only in its formal role as a Community institution, but also because of its wealth of experience in this field and the deep personal commitment that has been exemplified by so many of its Members.</p>
<p class="contents">This cooperation will give ample opportunity for the representatives of civil society to be heard too, for the Commission appreciates that policy in this field cannot be made in the absence of a true dialogue with civil society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on two further issues specifically related to management of the European initiative for democracy and human rights. Firstly, in November, Commissioner van den Broek discussed with this Parliament the need for technical assistance to help in managing the budget headings covered by the European initiative for democracy and human rights. Since then the 1999 budget has been adopted with specific provision for the financing of such assistance from within these budget headings, unlike 1998 when it was not possible to conclude a contract. This will now be possible in 1999. The preparatory work for the conclusion of the contract has been finalised, though the Commission has yet to take a formal decision. It has been decided that there should be a contract to cover the services related to the budget headings managed by DG IA, including the needs of the RELEX common services and DG IA itself, and those related to the running of an enhanced programme of micro‐projects led by the delegations. As soon as a Commission decision is taken a contract will be concluded, thus ending this gap in support for the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the initiative for democracy and human rights will operate this year through two main windows, apart from activities such as joint programmes with the Council of Europe which are concluded directly by the Commission. The first main window is the micro‐projects programme which has been extended to cover each of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, former Yugoslavia, and the former Soviet Union and Mongolia. This window provides for extensive support to local NGOs and is to be managed at a local level without need to refer to Brussels for each financing decision.</p>
<p class="contents">This scheme has already been praised in the past and its extension in 1999 is the cornerstone of a strategy of keeping NGOs closely involved in the democratisation programme despite the limitations on managerial programme support which have militated in favour of larger projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The second window is a call for proposals to be issued any day now which will cover not only all the budget headings managed by DG IA but also those concerning ACP countries, including special programmes for Nigeria and for Southern Africa. The decision to run the budget headings together is part of an ongoing process of unifying the approach to human rights support right across the world. The call for proposals has already elicited the interest of NGOs which look to these budget headings as an important source of support for their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one comment to the rapporteur, Mr Torres Couto, concerning a remark, which I may have misunderstood, as I cannot accept a criticism that you may have made. There is evidence, both from the Court of Auditors' reports and from the independent evaluation of PHARE and TACIS democracy, that there is no mismanagement and fraud in this programme. The funds made available by this budget sometimes have been spent more slowly that we would have wanted. That is your point as well. But they were, in fact, well spent. This is an important thing that, on behalf of the Commission, I should say to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we are at the closing stages and soon we can look forward to the legal and financial framework that puts an end to the uncertainty that has surrounded this particular initiative. I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs once again for their hard work in bringing about the adoption of these two very necessary regulations.</p>
