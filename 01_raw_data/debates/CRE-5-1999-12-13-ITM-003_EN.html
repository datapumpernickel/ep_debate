Why? I can see two circumstantial reasons and one intrinsic reason. The circumstances are familiar to you. Firstly, the conference failed due to lack of time. Only Friday afternoon remained, i.e. too little time to come to a conclusion within a reasonable period. This can be explained by the way the conference itself was run, since it did not enable any real negotiation until the last two days. There was also, another circumstantial reason, a manifest inability on the part of some delegations to engage in a real process of negotiation on the order of business and, in this respect, one has to wonder if the fact that the opening of the conference coincided with the launching of the election campaign in the United States was a good thing. It indeed appeared that this country was scarcely prepared to shift position on any subject whatsoever, which by definition makes it hard to conclude negotiations successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the intrinsic reason, I believe that the failure of the conference can be explained by the gap between the ambitions of the World Trade Organisation and its resources. WTO procedures proved to be inappropriate to the simultaneous requirement to integrate new parties, i.e. an increasing number of developing countries who are demanding their place around the table, and new subjects, which goes beyond our traditional agenda. These new subjects are ones that you are aware of: the environment, social standards, for example. Considering the number of parties and subjects involved and the fundamental differences between a number of participants, the chances of arriving at an agreement were extremely slim. </p>
<p class="contents">If we dwell for a moment on this intrinsic reason, I believe it must be acknowledged that the WTO must no longer henceforth supervise the negotiation of liberalisation between industrialised countries and that this order has been changed in two ways: firstly, it is no longer possible to limit ourselves to lowering some tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. We must concern ourselves with the impact of this liberalisation on the main parameters of our development models, the fundamental rights of workers, environmental and health protection, cultural diversity, multifunctionality in agriculture and quality of the environment. Secondly, it is no longer possible to circumscribe negotiation to just a few participants, the Union and its friends, the United States and the Cairns group. In Seattle, it was necessary, more than in the past, to take into account the chief third world partners, India, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt, plus the emerging economies, particularly in South East Asia, and also our partners, the ACP countries. Tomorrow, we shall probably also have to take China into account. The combination of new subjects and new participants opens up very good prospects of progressing towards controlled globalisation, but the difficulty of such an enterprise is readily apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the issues were concerned, the Union had made good preparations for Seattle, advocating a broad agenda which complied with the expectations of society, and which was championed by Parliament, the elected body, the legitimate representative of this society. In addition to extending the negotiations to all the partners, including developing countries, the European Union also took the initiative to open up the conference by means of an offer to guarantee the least advanced countries broad zero-duty access to the markets of the industrialised countries. It succeeded in aligning, first, Japan with this initiative, and then also perhaps the United States and Canada. But let us make no mistake and let us keep our eyes open wide. In return for their support of our agenda in terms of society, the environment, health and workers’ rights, developing countries with average revenue and emerging economies are going to be asking for substantial improvements in access to our markets. And Seattle has demonstrated that we still had to convince these countries that our concerns, your concerns, are something other than reflexes in defence of our own well-being which often seems so much of a privilege to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just briefly mention the European Union’s strategy in Seattle. The Community is well positioned to build bridges between the positions of industrialised countries and developing countries. We showed this clearly at Seattle, where we were well prepared both politically and in terms of content and we enjoyed the support, the precious support, I believe, of both the Council and of Parliament. We remained united and, at the same time, open. Occasionally, we shifted position if it was deemed necessary in order to move the negotiations on. This was the case, for example, regarding the biotechnology group, which I considered appropriate to accept at a certain time. This gave rise to sharp criticism from some Member States, and indeed from some Members of Parliament. I take full responsibility for the risk</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">taken at this time, given that the European Union was the only delegation which was pushing an ambitious agenda on the subject of the environment. I remain convinced that a biotechnology group focussed on factual analysis and not on negotiation would have been a small price to pay in order to get a considerable raft of environmental proposals through.</p>
<p class="contents">We also made a major effort as regards information and participation in order to put into practice the intentions I expressed before this House during the parliamentary hearings in September. A delegation of representatives of the European Parliament was part of our Community delegation. We kept in contact on an on-going basis, enabling an exchange of views and information, which proved to be extremely useful to me in my capacity as a negotiator. This positive experience strengthens my conviction that we should continue to involve the European Parliament more closely in framing our common trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of increased transparency, we also, for the first time, brought in a group of consultants representing management and unions, the Economic and Social Committee and NGOs. Through them, we maintained contact with society and economic and social interest groups. Daily briefings were organised for the economic organisations and the NGOs accredited by the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, we return from Seattle with the feeling that we did much to make this conference a success. Now we have to continue the work which has been started. What direction should we be going in and what do we have to do now?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that initiating a new round on the basis of a broad agenda remains our priority. We must now, however, proceed with caution. A second failed attempt would, of course, be disastrous.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear at present at what time we will be able to recommence the round of negotiations. You have to realise that there is a real feeling of discontent in developing countries, and that any attempt to restart the process must necessarily involve repairing the damage caused in this area, which may take some time.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our options? I can see three possibilities. The first scenario is to convene another ministerial conference quickly. The people in favour of this scenario claim that there was, after all, substantial progress in Seattle, for example, concerning questions of market access, the promotion of trade or services. From this point of view, the subjects which were not successfully concluded in Seattle, such as agriculture, anti-dumping and fundamental social standards, should now be tackled quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the United States has just declared that the round may be quickly recommenced. The bilateral Summit at which we are to meet this week will afford us the opportunity to check whether this is a sign of flexibility or just a repetition of the well-known American positions which favour a round limited to market access.</p>
<p class="contents">The second scenario is rather more gloomy. It takes account of the hypothesis which says that the United States will not, in any event, make any moves during an election campaign. If that should prove true, there would be no progress before the year 2001. The implications of this scenario are worrying ones. Not only would we lose precious time, but that would also mean that the inability of a single partner to move would be enough to paralyse the entire multilateral system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third scenario, one I would call an interim scenario. If we do not wish to wait for 18 months before resuming negotiations, let us try as of now to move things forward step by step. An interim package might make it possible to restore confidence in the system and to create conditions favourable to the launch of a new round as soon as possible. It would therefore be necessary to continue the preparations in progress at Geneva, particularly our process of alliance moving towards broader negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the following steps could be envisaged. Firstly, institutional reform of the WTO. Well before Seattle, we had submitted detailed proposals on the transparency of WTO activities. We must go further and determine precisely the causes of the practical problems which slowed down the process in Seattle, and then propose some practical solutions which are centred on the efficiency-transparency axis.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards transparency, it is clear that decision making and negotiations must be legitimised in the clearest and most consistent manner. As regards efficiency, the organisation of work, the procedures, the bodies, and the ministerial conferences must be reviewed with a view to obtaining practical results.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the suggestions put forward by the Members of the European Parliament present at Seattle and reiterated last week by a number of Member States was to convene a parliamentary assembly. This idea appeals to me, since it would make it possible to strengthen democratic control over work within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The third crucial element is developing countries. These are among the countries most disappointed and most affected by the lack of results. Restarting the process leading to a new round must by necessity represent substantial progress for them, if we wish to obtain their support. One of the ways to obtain this support would be to maintain our offer to the least advanced countries and to examine together the coordination between the action of the WTO and that of other international institutions in order to ensure that trade liberalisation results in sustainable development for all developing countries, beginning with the very poorest peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">These interim steps which I have just outlined would enable us to keep the process alive and to be ready, when the time comes, to resume work for a complete round. We must therefore combine two approaches. Firstly, regarding the content, in striving to form alliances and to retain support in favour of a broad approach to the round, and secondly, on the form, the institutional plan and the procedures, in order to set in place all we shall need throughout future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the direction we will work in, if the Council and Parliament are in agreement.</p>

That is the conclusion which we too believe should be drawn from the unsuccessful negotiations in Seattle. May I thank you, Commissioner Lamy, and the entire Commission Delegation for being so well prepared and for leading the negotiations so skilfully. By taking such a dynamic lead – in close cooperation with the European Parliament Delegation – the Commission showed, with its comprehensive negotiating strategy, that it had set the course for a possible success.</p>
<p class="contents">The poor level of preparation on the part of the WTO, but also the tactics of the United States and other countries, did not, however, permit a successful conclusion. It is with satisfaction that we also not only take note of your support – which you have just reiterated – for the WTO parliamentary assembly which we have called for, but also express the hope that you will give us practical support as far as those responsible in the WTO are concerned in our efforts to make this a reality. In this process, cooperation between the European Union, North America, Mercosur, ASEAN and the ACP countries should allow this parliamentary assembly to be organised effectively, with the regional groupings able to play an important role in the interests of greater efficacy. Now, what needs to be done in the months, and perhaps in the year, ahead?</p>
<p class="contents">We too believe that we need to keep the global negotiating strategy and consolidate it further in the coming months. We need to open and pursue an active dialogue with those countries, including the newly industrialised and developing countries, whose positions still diverge widely from ours. Our chances of winning over these countries should be all the greater if we remain consistent. The focus here should be on the following core areas of trade in goods and services: further reductions in tariffs and the gradual elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade; investment; competition and services; intellectual property; public procurement and e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">They are essential components of further trade liberalisation and will benefit most of our negotiating partners. In addition, reform of the WTO is urgent and imperative. Secondly, in this process, European environmental and health policies, minimum social standards and development policy should retain their status. Thirdly, at the forthcoming negotiations on agriculture, emphasis should be placed on the multifunctional reasons for our European model of agriculture – the further development of rural areas, the provision of high-quality agricultural products and the environment – with reference being made also to Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">In the negotiations with China, which are now beginning, we should concentrate on our own interests, which are in part also contrary to those of the United States. Reducing the high Chinese peak tariffs, protecting intellectual property and facilitating investment are the most important points here. Increased market access for the least developed countries – and this is something which we need to consider together – should in any case be achieved very soon as part of the negotiations on the new ACP convention, although I do not know whether this will work on a unilateral basis. These countries should be granted waivers of between eight and ten years to allow them to adopt the comprehensive WTO body of legislation slowly and gradually, without neglecting their programme of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seguro (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we have listened closely to your intervention on the Seattle Conference and we appreciate your adherence to the debate, to the commitments that you made here, specifically in the November part-session in which this issue was discussed. </p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless true that, as you yourself pointed out, no agreement was reached in Seattle, and the problems remain. They remain, and for us Socialists, the failure is not just that no agreement was reached. The failure can be seen in the fact that following the Uruguay Round, the volume of trade in the context of this agreement has increased but unfortunately, so has the gap between developed and developing countries. For those who see trade as an instrument for making society more harmonious and prosperous, as we Socialists do, this situation can only be of grave concern. This is why our points of view are still valid in relation to the content, the strategy and the nature of the agreement. It is worth stating once again that where the content is concerned, we are still fighting for environmental issues, for consumer protection, for social and human rights, for cultural diversity and for the multifunctional role of agriculture. This is not with a view to indulging in a pretty protectionist strategy where the markets are concerned, but with a view to guaranteeing the kind of global society that we can now glimpse. </p>
<p class="contents">In terms of strategy, we would like to see the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament combine their efforts and unite in the same direction. I also think it important, as your words imply, that we should not be totally dependent on the United States and that we are able to find new partnerships, not only in terms of trade with other regional blocs and with other world trading powers. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in relation to the nature of the agreement: it is true that we all wanted an agreement, but failure to reach one is better than an agreement which will have an unsatisfactory outcome. This is why we are once again arguing for an overall agreement and not sectoral agreements, which is what the United States is once again seeking. We feel that the market is not a solution to all problems but neither is it the source of all evil. The market is essential to wealth creation and it is with this in mind that we want to argue for five more points here:</p>
<p class="contents">firstly, a new agenda for Geneva that is not just the “leftovers” from Marrakech; </p>
<p class="contents">secondly, to uphold the European Union’s common strategy of seeking out numerous new partnerships; </p>
<p class="contents">thirdly, greater transparency and more legitimacy in the decisions, which is why we support the proposal for a Parliamentary body which would monitor the democratic nature of proceedings;</p>
<p class="contents">fourthly, that the European institutions understand why non-governmental organisations should be present in Seattle and specifically that the European Parliament should be able to find fora for discussion, debate and ideas so that we can be spokespeople for this civil community whose concerns are exactly the same as ours. </p>
<p class="contents">And finally, Mr President, I would like to end by saying that we support institutional reform that enables developing countries to be given greater consideration in the WTO’s decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One general remark if I may. Much has been said since Seattle about the procedural and organisational shortcomings of the WTO. Whilst all proposals to improve WTO procedures are naturally welcome, there is a danger that we might be embarking on the reinvention of the wheel. The WTO is an intergovernmental organisation with over 130 members, so it will remain, by definition, a somewhat cumbersome decision-making forum. That is, unfortunately, the unavoidable nature of the beast.</p>
<p class="contents">A concentration on procedural and organisational issues should not blind us to one simple fact: if the political will had existed in Seattle, particularly within the US Administration, the procedural flaws of the system would have been overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus our primary task remains a political, not a technical one, namely to rehabilitate the public case for further trade liberalisation, not only for the benefit of European businesses and consumers, but most particularly because open trade offers the only viable long-term solution to poverty in a developing world. That is why the ELDR Group hopes that the Commission, the Council and this Parliament will embark on a proactive attempt to remake the political case for further trade liberalisation in general and for a new comprehensive round, rather than an intermediate round, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU/US Summit which takes place the day after tomorrow is exactly the right place to start since it is the US which has been found to be most politically wanting in recent weeks and months. The need for EU political leadership which was amply on display in Seattle in international trade affairs is now more acute than ever. Whilst to focus on procedural details is essential, no amount of organisational improvements will compensate for the biggest loss at Seattle, a loss of political conviction in the merits of open, multilateral rules-based trade liberalisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is a first, and it certainly proved to be a positive experience for everyone concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, nonetheless, differences of opinion. In particular, I think that the proposal relating to the “biotechnology” working party was not the right one, but it would be truly boring if we always agreed on everything.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is important that we examine the causes of the failure. Several of these have been mentioned. They seem accurate to me. I would add one more: I believe that developing countries can no longer accept being treated as they have until now. Having the representatives of the most industrialised countries meet in a conference room, at the end of the negotiations, while the others wait in the antechamber before having to sign a text prepared in advance seems to me an unacceptable process, and I believe that many of us here would agree with me on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our way of negotiating must therefore be reviewed. A whole raft of issues to do with the WTO must also be reviewed. In particular, I think that besides the problems with the decision-making and negotiation mechanisms, the basic principles of the WTO also are in need of a face-lift. Let us not forget, even so, that it was in the 1940s, after the war, that the first GATT negotiations took place, and that at the time people were still traumatised after the great depression of 1929 and the thirties, and that the priority then was to track down overcautious, dangerous protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty years on, I feel that priorities have changed. I believe that this is something which must be reviewed and, above all, the question must be asked as to whether generalised free trade is compatible with States, the European Union in particular, having the opportunity to respond to other requirements, primarily, in my opinion, the requirement for sustainable development throughout the world. A number of WTO mechanisms and principles run counter to this objective of sustainable development both socially and ecologically. I believe we must have the courage – now that we have time for this – to analyse these mechanisms seriously and to make proposals, establishing dialogue, as a priority, with developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My impression is that the European Union is very fond of dialogue with the USA. I am not opposed to that, of course, but I believe that favouring dialogue with the USA is also likely to backfire on us when, at a later date, we have to discuss matters with developing countries, particularly ACP countries. I think this must be reviewed, and the legitimate claims of these countries must be taken more seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our first task, therefore, is to make a lucid diagnosis of what happened in order to assume our responsibilities in full knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard the analysis which Mr Lamy has given, as it were, from inside the institution. I would like to offer an outsider’s point of view. In Seattle, I had the opportunity to have discussions lasting many hours with these men and women, the representatives of society, as it were, who came from all four corners of the earth. I was also able to hold talks with some of the main organisers of this mobilisation of forces. They naturally gauged the influence and the support they enjoyed throughout the world: they were, therefore, enthusiastic and determined, but in no way violent, populist or nationalistic, as some observers saw fit to caricature them.</p>
<p class="contents">They were well informed, thoughtful, adult in their attitude. They meant to be involved in decisions as responsible citizens, and no longer just treated as passive consumers. They were not challenging opening up to the world, but the globalisation of a mercantile attitude. Far from identifying with the champions of their own countries in the world-wide economic war, the different people involved were together censuring the capitalism of the multinationals, the relentless quest for profits, treating the natural world as a commodity, going as far as to patent living things, the levelling of cultures, the entrenchment of inequalities practically everywhere, especially between the North and South. Their ambition was quite simply to make the modern world more civilised, to make globalisation more human. “People before benefits” was one of their favourite slogans.</p>
<p class="contents">We must listen to them, as Mr Somavia wisely noted, the present Director General of the International Labour Organisation, which four years ago was the moving spirit behind the International Conference in Copenhagen, where all the world’s Heads of State undertook to reduce poverty by half by 2015. Listening to them would involve changing the WTO radically. This starts, in my opinion, with the current framework of the WTO, a framework which is not really universal but is truly unequal, as Mr Lannoye very clearly depicted. It also involves the current tasks of the WTO which set the objective of capturing market shares in precedence to absolutely everything, including the commitments made by the international community as regards social, environmental or health matters, or the development of the south. Changing the WTO, finally, involves its current mode of operation, which is still based on Summit diplomacy and secrecy at a time when citizens are becoming actively involved in world affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am arguing, Mr President, in favour of a proper study offering a critical analysis of past experience, followed by the Union taking the offensive in favour of a more democratic organisation, open to society, which is truly universal and which steadfastly overcomes the divide between commercial considerations and the demands of sustainable and socially cohesive development. This would be one more fine ambition for Europe’s emerging policy on foreign affairs and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group had deplored in this House the lack of preparation for this conference, the lack of an objective assessment of the Uruguay Round, the sly attempt to reintroduce the Multilateral Agreement on Investment in a roundabout way, the objective of fast-track liberalisation, without recognition of the legitimacy of regional preference areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Seattle demonstrators put an end to this sidelong drift. They stopped a conference prepared by the powerful chiefly for their own benefit and thereby obtained the moratorium which is precisely what my group was asking for. We are delighted with this, but now we must use this moratorium to prepare ourselves better for future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards procedure, we want careful thought to be given, in the European Parliament and in the Council, to the democratic supervision of the Commission during such international negotiations. We cannot forget that Mr Lamy, in a Commission statement not approved by the Council, proposed a working party on biotechnology, risking bringing this subject back into the negotiations as the Americans wanted, even though we rejected this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has explained just now, and also last week before the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that he hoped to receive far more in return for making this concession. This statement is not at all satisfactory to us and, in our opinion, he is just making things worse for himself, since, in our opinion, this point specifically was not at all open to negotiation. Fortunately, in the end, Seattle was a failure, because otherwise who knows where they were going to take us.</p>
<p class="contents">As was ever its wont, the Commission thinks itself above the Council and seeks to do just what it wishes. This must be changed. It must be changed all the more in consideration of the fact that the Commission had obtained a broad mandate for negotiation on the agenda, including matters such as investment and services, which are normally the prerogative of Member States. We consider that this point, too, is one that must be clarified properly in future, since it could have drifted towards a final negotiating mandate which would have reduced or eliminated the responsibilities of national parliaments. In future negotiations, on the contrary much stricter parallel control by national parliaments and by the European Parliament must be instituted. Supervision of the Commission must thus be reformed, but we must also take advantage of this time which has been given us to draw up a proper objective assessment of the Uruguay Round.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, in future, the running of the World Trade Organisation must be reviewed in order to establish the fundamental principle that only peoples have sovereign power, that they are free to choose their lifestyle and to express their preferences, and, finally, that multinationals must adapt in order to comply with the will of the people, rather than the people adapting to comply with the needs of the multinationals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be a disaster for the producers and the workers of the weakest countries, and not, as was said, for the multinationals, which would find, as they have always found, ways to penetrate industry and trade more deeply anywhere in the world. It would be a disaster for the consumers in European countries, in particular for the weakest consumers who would be frustrated in their hope to have a wide choice of products from all over the world at lower prices than those found in the national markets. It would be a disaster for the environment, as the poorest countries, whose products would be denied access to European and American markets, would continue to exploit natural resources. </p>
<p class="contents">Seattle did not fail, Commissioner, because of the WTO’s inadequacy or the United States’ electoral campaign, although this did contribute to the failure. Seattle failed because the political desire of the main countries was to slow down, instead of accelerating international trade. Europe, Commissioner, added its problems, thus overburdening the agenda with subjects unrelated to the specific field of international trade and providing an excuse for those who stood to benefit from applying pressure to slow down the process of integrating world markets, but certainly these benefits – I repeat – did not extend to European consumers or Indian or Pakistani workers. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Europe, with its age-old tradition of the market economy, free trade and economic freedom – freedom which does not need to be qualified by adjectives – must assert that the objective of integrating the markets and of free trade is a goal in itself, which we must attain for ourselves and all the other countries.

On the contrary, I would support those who have said that not only did they have a coherent delegation to lead but that the practical arrangements for us – the largest Parliamentary delegation which had ever attended international trade talks – were to our mutual benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">It looks as though we will have to wait for the new millennium now for a Millennium Round. Was it a victory, a disaster or an unexpected welcome break in Seattle? People are right to say that the procedure should have been better. We need better decision making. We need quicker dispute settlement procedures. However, it was the substance which was the problem: an overload of a traditional trade agenda with non-trade issues. Globalisation has led to a number of issues which touch the sovereignty of Nation States being put on a trade agenda. President Clinton's call for the enforcement of trade labour standards for developing countries and elsewhere in the world was the death knell of these talks.</p>
<p class="contents">But linking these two together – procedure and substance – I welcome the Commissioner's support for a parliamentary body of some kind. This will not only help the democratic accountability of the WTO, help to provide an on-going interface with non-governmental organisations, but also help the gradual evolution of the non-trade concerns on the agenda. These are, after all, concerns of elected representatives. In this respect, it is an unexpected welcome break.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us have no illusions. The US Administration is not going to change its position before the election. Nevertheless, when we were in Seattle we had excellent talks with US legislators. I ask the Commission to help us develop our contacts on discussion of specific issues such as agriculture in the intervening period so we can assist this intermediate solution. I believe they are willing to have dialogue with us on a number of specific issues. Maybe dialogue between transatlantic legislators can help in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of those taking part in the discussions, he was far and away the most skilful and appeared to show the most stamina. That is important to recognise.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions in Seattle were perhaps more complex than could have been anticipated: they were certainly over-ambitious, and that should have been anticipated. There was a quite absurd concentration of time limits, particularly since some of the time was lost because of extraneous events. There was a hysterical press interest, not in what was happening in the discussions, but in what was happening on the streets, which was largely due to complete clumsiness by the local police.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a complexity because of the sheer number of participants, not only from the countries concerned, but from NGOs, from lobbyists, from national government delegations and from others. The issues themselves were complex. This was not a game of poker, it was a complex game of chess with completely justifiable but contradictory claims taking the stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was, in fact, very well placed. Over the years of our existence we have managed to put in place environmental and social rules alongside trade rules. It can be done in international discussions. It is not easy but it is essential and we are well placed because we have, to a limited extent, managed that.</p>
<p class="contents">We were well placed because of our links with the ACP countries, although there was an issue over their waiver which clouded the discussions, and because we have always worked well with NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We were well placed in having a large parliamentary delegation. I am pleased that our socialist amendment calling for a parliamentary assembly was taken up world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of agriculture: The United States and other countries refused to understand, even though it is a very simple notion, the multifunctional reasons for our common agricultural policy. They refuse to admit that they subsidise their agriculture in a much less transparent way than we do.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as environmental issues were concerned, these are not and should not be simply concerns of rich countries, but they were portrayed as such and there is a great deal of work to do in bringing those issues to a State where they are not thought of as protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy says that the biotech working group was fact-finding, but the widespread perception was that it would interfere with the setting-up of the bio-safety protocol and colleagues will say more about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare was perceived by poor countries as a rich person's interest which, to some of them, was almost obscene where we are confronted with starving people. That is something again we will have to work on and similarly with core labour standards. It is important that the WTO is restored in a reformed way. The alternative is the United States making bilateral agreements from a position of strength with the poorer countries of the world. That is not what we want. We, in the Parliament, must follow this issue along with Mr Lamy and other Commissioners until we get something that is appropriate to the age which we are moving into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cooperation was good, which I am grateful for. The problem is that the WTO basically lacks popular support, and the developing countries, even if they are present there, feel left out. I therefore believe that it was very important indeed that we agreed to demand greater openness and to make room for popular influence on decision making by means of a parliamentary forum.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the failure in Seattle, I do not however believe that we should “cry over spilled milk”, as we say in Sweden. Instead, we should use the time to do some forward thinking. We have been made aware of the problems and we have also, I think, glimpsed certain possibilities. Unlike Mrs McNally, I perceive, rather, a slight opening-up on the part of the Americans, not least in the sphere of agriculture. America has trebled the amount of its agricultural subsidies since the last farm bill was adopted and, although the multifunctional reasons for our policy may not be recognised, large parts of its content nonetheless are in fact acknowledged, which I think is positive. </p>
<p class="contents">As a relatively liberal, perhaps very liberal, European politician where agriculture is concerned, I should like to say that we ourselves within the EU ought to reflect upon how we can change the CAP, Agenda 2000 and what follows Agenda 2000 and consider how we might get rid of subsidies which drive down the level of trade. It would be good to discuss this with the developing countries because these are very dependent indeed upon exporting raw materials. It would also be good for other exporters. In fact, an enlarged EU, which we hope we are making great strides towards, will also become more and more dependent precisely upon being able to export agricultural products. It is in specifically this situation that I think that the present talks and the reflections we can engage in will be extremely useful. I believe there are good opportunities for making further progress.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner Lamy and others have spoken of the Seattle meeting as a failure but I still believe that, if the EU and the US in particular learn the lessons of the past few weeks, the meeting in Seattle could still go down in history not as a failure but as the moment when world leaders finally realised that they need a radically different approach to international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">First, they must learn that rich countries can no longer get something for nothing. If they want rightly to link social and environmental concerns with trade they will need both to prove that their motives are not protectionist and to deliver substantial gains for developing countries in return. Those gains could include tariff-free access for all goods from the poorest countries, the abolition of tariff peaks and agreements to stop export dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it is clear that trade deals can no longer be secretly stitched up between the more powerful WTO members. Developing countries have shown a new determination to resist such marginalisation. The playing field between the richer and poorer countries is anything but level. If you look at negotiating capacity alone, the EU and the US were present in Seattle with whole armies of lawyers and advisors. The poorer countries were there with very few. I have also heard – and I would be grateful to know if this is true – that 30 countries, members of the WTO, could not even afford to be at the meeting to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO process needs to be made far more democratic and transparent. I believe that we need a forum to discuss proposals for radical reform with the environmental and development groups who have been working on this subject for a great many years. There is no need to re-invent the wheel. There are good proposals out there. We need to learn from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, WTO members must at last listen to the 1 200 non-governmental organisations from nearly 100 countries who signed a declaration demanding no further trade liberalisation until the social and environmental impacts of existing liberalisation have been addressed and the problems put right. The stalling of the talks in Seattle gives us an opportunity to do just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the first time that protests on that scale have been held in the United States since the war in Vietnam. The awakening of people’s movements all over the world proves the objection to the principles of the World Trade Organisation.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, trade liberalisation, the abolishment of subsidies, free investments, the commercialisation of services, even education, health and cultural services, serve the major interests of the monopolies to increase their profit margins. However, it is not at all appealing for the workers or the people. Even the much-publicised complete abolition of tariffs on products from poorer countries will precipitate the pillaging of wealth of those countries, while on the other hand it will deluge the market with cheap products replacing corresponding products from countries such as mine. The World Trade Organisation was not formed to protect the interests of workers and the people, the proof of which lies in the fact that the main decision-makers are the few wealthy countries and in the widening of inequalities between rich and poor countries, and also within those countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner made no mention of the grass-root reactions. Obviously, he wants to downplay them, and tell us that whatever the people do, the American, European, Japanese monopolies and the rest will impose their will and overcome these reactions together. We are certain that the grass-root reactions all over the world were probably the sole cause of the failure of these talks not just because the demonstrators thwarted the formal opening ceremony but because they created a climate which cannot be ignored even by those who think they control the world. And we have only just begun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, the problems and contradictions of the global economy are still there, unresolved and still relevant: doubts about genetically modified organisms, child labour, the negative social effects of unbridled, unregulated globalisation. But that is not all: perhaps these protests served as a pretext for the official participants at Seattle – those with the right to sit round the conference table – not to have to fully assume the political responsibility to negotiate, which, although certainly very difficult is absolutely necessary, precisely as regards social rights and safeguarding our citizens’ health. These are negotiations that cannot wait any longer. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are dealing with a complicated process, but Europe has to be equal to the challenges facing it. Talks within the World Trade Organisation have to start up again, and Europe has to be very aware of its role, a role of balance and responsibility, with a view to globalisation with a human aspect that is open and welcomes changes and acceleration in the economy but is also able to safeguard equal employment opportunities, the environment and health. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe must not forget to defend our own specific differences, not just economic but also cultural and social, because globalisation that leads to uniformity, levelling out and exploitation must have no place at all in the European growth model.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is nevertheless very little when compared with the very negative aspects that our trade partners are trying to impose on us in the text of the Agenda. I am referring to two points in particular:</p>
<p class="contents">– The first was an obsessive reference to the substantial reduction of internal aid for agriculture without taking the slightest account of the diversity of different countries’ structures of production and without taking account of an objective and consistent classification of the different types of subsidies allocated to agriculture. </p>
<p class="contents">– Secondly, and most importantly, the rejection of the idea of multifunctionality which is the main pillar of the European farm model and the basis for upholding the principle of the specific nature of agriculture. In fact, if this deliberate reference is not featured, it means that agriculture will be treated as a normal economic activity, whilst there is ever greater pressure from our competitors to end any kind of aid obtained and I stress “any kind”.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we all know that without special treatment for agriculture we will not be able to guarantee a minimum of Community preference nor as a result, the primary producing role of agriculture. If the producing role of agriculture comes to an end, then all its other functions or multifunctions will end with it. This is why it was a good thing that no agreement was reached in Seattle. In fact, the agreement that was envisaged was very damaging for agriculture and would have left us at the outset in a weakened negotiating position for the future whereas we are now in a stronger position than we ever have been to make an offensive stand in the new Round.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two final comments. Firstly, that it is crucial that the Commission and the Council establish an initiative with developing countries in order to make them our allies. Secondly, that a joint project with the United States would be extremely useful – as James Elles pointed out – in order to clarify the positions of both parties and to be able then to encourage future understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was done with consummate elegance, and I must say that I was present at many press conferences and I also went to the events organised by the non-governmental organisations. You also explained the European Union's negotiating position and its strategy with the utmost clarity. I believe that you made it clear that the European Union is in a position not only to take on a leading role in this and the forthcoming world trade round – and that we do not come here as poker players to secure our own interests – but also that we are prepared to bring the other countries, in particular the developing and least developed countries, on board with us.</p>
<p class="contents">This message has been heard, and I am proud to have been part of the delegation in Seattle. But we should not labour under any illusions. Two things have become apparent: one is that this accumulation of interests is something that we will continue to see in international negotiations in the future, and I should like to endorse the position of many leading economists who are saying that this was just the beginning. We will see that this conflict of national and regional interests will be even more pronounced in the future than it has been in the past. Here, of course, it will be important for us not to line up against each other in blocs – the European Union against the United States, the European Union/the United States against the developing countries, or perhaps also some of the developing countries against others – as we have seen in Seattle and also in other contexts. In the future, it will be much more important for us to adopt a more sophisticated approach with greater emphasis on preparation, so as to make it clear which interests we actually stand for together in these world trade rounds and why we need them: namely to bring globalisation under control, taming the rank growth which would otherwise proliferate without a world trade round, in order to implement a sound strategy to overcome global problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The second phenomenon which we saw – and here too, I do not believe that we should have any illusions – was that the interest which civil society showed in the proceedings in Seattle was not only an interest in the world trade round, but also a demonstration against all those things which people do not like. This started with the healthcare system in the United States. I spoke to many people on the streets. The issues ranged from future Chinese participation in the world trade round to the policies pursued in Cuba, and there were many other issues besides. Increasingly, politicians are being asked to explain – and to do so in greater depth than they have in the past – what the World Trade Organisation actually does and why it exists. Of course, it also needs to be reformed and to be made more transparent, but it must also be explained better. Here I am particularly glad that parliamentarians have now been included; other speakers have referred to this. The role which will fall to us, as a parliamentary forum, in the world trade round will not be easy. However, I believe that this is the only way to introduce greater democracy into such a complex bureaucratic machine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seattle also failed because it became clear that, in its present form, the WTO is neither transparent, nor subject to democratic control, nor public. Perhaps, for once, we should also reflect on the objectives which the WTO pursues. Many groups are in fact saying that the WTO is holding us back in our further development of social and environmental standards. We have actually consistently called – and now there is time to do this – for a long overdue analysis to be carried out of the impact which the Marrakech Round has had on individual countries and on the various laws in those countries, and how mankind, and not just trade, can develop further.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the agriculture protocol which might have emerged we can be glad that nothing did emerge. It is precisely this programme which would have pitted the small and medium-sized businesses in the developing countries and in the European Union against each other to compete on the lowest wages, the lowest standards and the lowest social conditions. That is precisely what people are concerned about. They no longer have any desire to delegate power on a permanent basis, power which is then delegated on to supranational organisations over which it is impossible to exercise further democratic control. We saw very clearly at the European elections this year that people will not continue to vote if it is no longer in their power to have a say in what should happen in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it all the more important for Parliament to be given full codetermination and power of codecision in the field of foreign economic affairs, because the national parliaments have relinquished their power and supervisory role. We in the European Parliament have not been accorded it. We owe it to civil society outside to demand precisely this.</p>

It received a mandate to include an extensive range of new areas in the Millennium Round, but in fact it intended to grant the WTO an increased range of responsibilities and powers. As far as we are concerned, it is not a matter of organising the continued extension of free trade better, but of prioritising the defence of social and environmental rights and of enabling all peoples to be self-determining and to decide their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">The delegation would also have us believe that they fought for the countries of the south. But they did nothing of the sort. As regards agriculture, the European Union defended only European agro-industry exporters against their North American competitors and the exporters of the Cairns Group. They did not stand up for the demands of European family-run or group-operated farms or the demands of the farmers of the south.</p>
<p class="contents">The demonstrators from all over the world who hindered the Seattle conference represent the first counterattack by the world against the dictatorship of markets and financial profits. They represent a hope for millions of workers, unemployed people and landless agricultural workers, and for all the victims of this capitalist world order that the WTO wishes to force on us.

What do we learn from this? Firstly, it makes little sense to meet in countries where an election campaign is underway. Anyone for whom public opinion at home is more important than international agreements should not be surprised when their guests take an invitation as an invitation to go home.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it makes little sense to reduce world trade to the concept of fair; the two concepts of fair and socially balanced need to go hand-in-hand. The international community is tired of protectionism, barriers to trade and being dictated to by a few global players.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the other hand it does make sense, in spite of all the differences between delegations, to speak with one voice. I very much welcome the way in which the Commission conducted itself. Your morning briefings to us Members of Parliament, Commissioner Lamy, were characterised by openness and a willingness to take account of our views. The result was that this time the EU sat not in the sin bin, but in the mediator's chair.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it makes sense to work more closely with the NGOs. However, at their day-long symposium in Seattle they hardly had a chance to speak. I was forced to realise that only a few people are aware of how close Europe is to them. Whether it was protecting the environment, animals, health or consumers that was being discussed, the dialogue was broken off before it had had chance to start. The demonstrations paralysed the conference. What began as a good-natured event degenerated into a state of siege with a high degree of aggression and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it makes sense also to deal with controversial matters. The taboos of today can be workable compromises tomorrow. Admittedly the subjects have to be handled sensitively. The American President's statement that if labour standards were not implemented then sanctions might be imposed was far from helpful. This reached us conference participants not by chance but by design. The EU will, however, be capable of winning a majority on the proposal for a permanent WTO and ILO forum, on questions of fundamental rights and on rules of the social market economy. Despite Seattle, therefore, there are definitely grounds for hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many non-governmental organisations spoke of a victory being won in Seattle. Many of the ACP countries spoke of a victory being won for their cause in Seattle. If we are talking in terms of victories then I have only one thing to say: nothing was won in Seattle except time, and as yet it is completely unclear to us how little time we have to devote to this matter. The issue which we need to address is the underlying disquiet. The fact that worldwide the environmental and social situation has not taken a turn for the better concerns us. At the weekend, I attended a symposium with non-governmental organisations, with farmers' representatives from Honduras and employees' representatives from South America. All of them – all – were extremely unhappy with the situation. This did serve to show me, however, that what we actually wanted out of this world trade round was not at all clear and transparent either.</p>
<p class="contents">Hand on our heart then, if we glance through the newspapers, we realise that even within the European Union our concerns – whether related to environmental policy, social policy or the core labour standards – were portrayed as protectionist; even at home in the European Union we were not able to communicate our concerns, let alone within the group of States of the World Trade Organisation. One lesson which we should draw from this would be to find answers to the following questions: how do we integrate parliamentarianism with the concerns of the non-governmental organisations? How do we handle the new sensitive situation in which people are starting to fight back? How do we make this work? What platform can we offer for it? I believe that we have laid the best foundation for successful future cooperation within the European Union, within the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The WTO is a failure in its present form because the WTO is no longer appropriate nor is it transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson we must draw is in fact the one the NGOs were demanding, i.e. there must be fair trade, not free trade, and in this respect, we must realise that nowadays no international organisation can escape the watchful eye of the citizen and that this is to be expected. The next deadline is already quite close. Geneva must not be allowed to go stealthily by. We, of course, have Marrakech, we, of course, have no obligation to achieve results, but we must remain vigilant in order to ensure that separate agreements on agriculture and services do not allow the things we shut the door on to get in by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the lessons of Seattle, and Commissioner Lamy started to draw conclusions, is that we must find allies. We do, admittedly, already have a few allies. The most important ones will no doubt be, as Paul Lannoye emphasised, the ACP countries. To take European agriculture as an example, it cannot go on saying that it is doing fine, that it is multifunctional, that it is operating in a positive way, that it will henceforth protect its consumers, while at the same time maintaining a selfish attitude with regard to the countries of the south. In order to be heard, we must find the resources to enable these poorest countries to also have quality food, and quality products. The whole world today has the right to show solidarity and to have the resources to live better, to get out of this state of international self-centredness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is the biggest exporter in the world – around 22% of exports traded on the world market come from Europe. For us this means that we have a clear responsibility to take the lead on world trade. It is said that without trade there is no prosperity. To combat world poverty is a genuine and honourable undertaking. At the end of the day, trade is a source of wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our major aims in WTO negotiations is, ultimately, also to guarantee good health into old age. Health is not unrelated to the life sciences and biotechnology. I believe that we should not shy away from a debate in this sector; we should not be too cowardly also to discuss the advantages of biotechnology and the life sciences in the WTO context. We should state clearly what is of use to us and what is damaging. We should fight against those things which are damaging, but we should also give unambiguous support to those things which are of use to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Some organisational aspects also need to be contended. We need framework rules which do not accord preferential treatment to one side. The reform also needs to incorporate a change at ministerial level. In the light of the principle of unanimity, we need perhaps a round of the M7 – the seven most important importing and exporting countries – so that they can sit down together and reach a preliminary decision. We need a round of parliamentarians, perhaps with a majority voting system, and thirdly we need the non-governmental organisations, who ought to play a leading advisory role in particular in the social dialogue with the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy, I am glad that you are taking on the position of leader. Make it clear that Europe is the number one player in world trade! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I take it that he is aware that this House is also grateful for the part he played and for the way in which he involved the European Parliament delegation. With your permission, I shall comment on the consequences of the failure of this ministerial conference. What conclusions should we draw in terms of continuing the work? One thing is certain: whether there is another ministerial conference now or whether work has to proceed on a step-by-step basis, never again can another working round be allowed to open without there being a clear agenda which has been put to the vote and agreed. This must surely be one of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are now to continue the work solely on the basis of Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, what then are our responsibilities under the agreement? I am convinced that they are perfectly obvious: Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture contains the condition that, amongst other things, non-trade-related concerns are also to be taken into account. For this reason, at every step, at all the negotiations, the precautionary principle must be constantly reiterated; it must be put repeatedly on the agenda as if this were a Tibetan prayer wheel. Each of the speakers here keeps repeating the words: consumer protection, precautionary principle and environment policy, but then we also need to make this clear. We also need to make it clear that environmental standards and food safety are often hotly disputed here, that it is only with difficulty that we achieve this here in the European Union, that the legislation is controversial, and that if we have adopted it, it is because of our responsibility to the people of the European Union – to whom we are accountable as elected parliamentarians – and not for reasons of tactical protectionism. We also need to make this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, it must go without saying that extending individual parts of the WTO rules or overhauling them completely can only be possible once this institution is at long last democratic, once it is transparent and once it is less authoritarian. Perhaps the failure of this first WTO Ministerial Conference is also a huge blessing in disguise because the arrogance and lack of democracy has been exposed and now we have an opportunity to change it. The time is right to do so! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a rare occasion so he should enjoy it.</p>
<p class="contents">As he suggests, we should be looking forward rather than backward now. We should welcome talk of modernisation and reform of the WTO and the recognition that we need seriously to modify the perception that is held elsewhere of the protectionist stance of the industrialised world.</p>
<p class="contents">A key objective for us must be for all 135 members of the WTO to have a part to play in that process of reform as well as what goes on afterwards. I can confirm that 30 members did not have the capacity or the ability to go to Seattle. My abiding memory was of the sense of exclusion felt by developing countries. They all remained adamant throughout that there was a great deal of post-Uruguay Round unfinished business – on textiles and agriculture in particular – that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I was heartened by the fact that three-quarters of the WTO members could no longer be ignored. It was they who were able to call a halt. Should we be surprised that they wanted to do that on the grounds that they have only 0.4% of the share of world trade? There are choices: either we allow globalisation to roll on without guidance or we rein it in to ensure that it brings benefits to all.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity to address the concerns raised in Seattle. That means identifying the problems and then acting. Of course, we did have the difficulty of the 135-page draft you took with you to Seattle, upon which you have no broad agreement, so it was hardly surprising that difficulties were encountered. At the end of the week, the developing countries were simply not prepared to accept a "done deal" made in secret rooms by the big players. Of course we recognise the fact that we need a rules-based system to regulate world trade but let us see more openness, let us see more and better ways of achieving and building global consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the men and women among you who gave me their support both during the Conference and today. I am particularly appreciative of this, since I think it is a method and style of working rather than personality which is involved, and this method of working is one that will prove useful in future. In any case, the conclusion that I draw is that this is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now make a few comments about the essential points. Firstly, as many of you have said, this failure at Seattle was probably a source of disappointment primarily to developing countries. If we acknowledge this fact, which I believe is now proven, looking back on it a week later, it is thus once the liberalisation of trade has been decided, managed and brought under control, that developing countries see the value it has for them, and no doubt they consider it better for them than the status quo with the development of bilateral relations which do not work in their favour. I believe that this is worth thinking about for the future, and is certainly something that we need to think about.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the institutional business of the WTO. I do not belong to that group of people which believes that this is where the main problem lies. I do, however, believe that part of the problem lies here. We should not be reinventing the wheel, admittedly, but what use is it if it has stopped turning properly? Let us at least take action to get the wheel turning again, or to adjust the load it is carrying. I think that this is the main thing, while taking account, as I believe the Commission is doing, of the extreme difficulties in getting 135 contractual parties to agree on an institutional system which is different to that which currently exists.</p>
<p class="contents">A third comment on the environment. I have listened to and taken in what you have said. Let us simply be aware that, in this area, we have considerable ambitions in relation to those of the other partners around the WTO table. Everyone can understand why developing countries may have a less ambitious environmental agenda to our own. But that the United States should have an environmental agenda less ambitious than our own, as is the case, is something which definitely presents us with a more difficult problem, for if neither developing countries nor the Americans agree with our agenda, we shall then have great difficulty in moving it forward. I believe that is something worth thinking about.</p>
<p class="contents">I stick to our credo, the Council conclusions, and the mandate which I was given. We must still, however, be quite aware that all this will not prove easy and that it will be necessary, at some point, either to be more convincing or to be more active.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my fourth and penultimate comment. Like many of you, I believe that it is now towards developing countries that we should direct our efforts to convince and our ability to form alliances. This will require persuasion, political effort and the presentation of arguments. Without doubt, it will also require some additional work which we shall have to think about. I am not currently in a position right to outline this support, but it is certain that these additional efforts will have to involve the increased opening up of our markets to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is not worth discussing this at length until the details are clearer, but I know too that as soon as the details do become clearer then enormous problems will arise. We shall have to think about this, and, when the time comes, present our proposals on the subject to the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding, I shall mention the issue of transparency. Yes, Seattle was a transparent event. One might reflect at length as to whether the fact that intense media activity, as there was at Seattle, always coincides with active transparency. Personally, I must tell you that just occasionally I feel some doubt and a little unease as to this coincidence, which we all too often try to perceive, between a massive media presence and active transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving that aside, in Seattle the WTO was, nonetheless, subjected to an ordeal of transparency for which it was obviously not prepared. If that was the case then so much the better. What we have to say regarding liberalisation, globalisation, our own concept of it and the question as to whether it is good or bad for the citizens you represent and to whom we are accountable, well, that is so much the better. This debate is one that I am happy to see take place in public. I think, as a number of you have said, that Europe has a stake in this debate since, as far as it is concerned and in this area, it is accustomed to it: why not share the benefit of our experience?</p>
