The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years. The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation. It goes without saying that the S&amp;D Group shares this position. We insist on Parliament’s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers’ money by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view. At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget. The S&amp;D Group does not share this view. We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions. We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first. This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence. However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S&amp;D Group decided to abstain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I will reiterate that we should reconsider whether we will not still find a solution for this area.

We adopted it with its three goals: to bring about full social inclusion through education and the labour market integration of people with disabilities; to combat the double discrimination faced by those who are young and disabled, female and disabled, or disabled in a rural or urban environment; and to move towards Europe-wide approval of what should be the fourth pillar of the welfare state, at a time when we are debating the sustainability of the welfare state as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is most important is that we are calling upon all countries to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and, especially, to unblock the directive on discrimination within the Commission itself, because Europe cannot employ, and it cannot apply, a piecemeal policy on discrimination against people who are today on the fringes of public efforts: what we need is a comprehensive and integrated policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This increase simply cannot be achieved without inclusive and specially adapted training programmes.

This is an exciting initiative and an example of a step towards realising our common vision of changing public and industrial perceptions of people with disabilities.</p>

While on the one hand, the States intervene with specific laws, on the other, society is not always ready to accept them fully and spontaneously apply them.

<p class="contents">For example, in the case of indigenous ethnic minorities, whose language is different from the official language of their Member State, we can only speak of equal opportunities if they have the same conditions as the majority ethnic group, meaning that they can study in their mother tongue and also use it to succeed later in life.</p>
<p class="contents">Women with disabilities and the elderly suffer from multiple disadvantages, but the same goes for people with disabilities who belong to one of the indigenous ethnic minorities.

It goes without saying that people with disabilities in the European Union should have the same opportunities as everyone else. It is true that we have a lot of catching up to do in this area and the rapporteur has rightly recognised and explained this.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, against the background of proportionality, I would like us to consider how we can clarify and resolve the situation, naturally while making efficient use of funding. What do I mean by this? I have one bad example from Germany. Over recent years, we have made a huge effort, and rightly so, to give disabled people barrier-free access to public buildings. No one disputes that this is the right thing to do. However, it has resulted in small primary schools with fewer than 100 pupils having to install a lift at a cost of EUR 150 000, despite the fact that these schools have never had a disabled pupil since they were established. This is not going to change. I do not regard this as proportionality. I am sure that the rapporteur also sees things in the same way and will take this into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, we in the European Union have already agreed on common rules for disabled people, so that they enjoy the same rights as everyone else.

However, no growth will occur unless the principle of competitiveness, which forms the basis for economic development, is observed.

Any other action will increase bureaucracy which will, in turn, stifle business activity.

The debate yesterday and the resolution today on the report have strongly encouraged me to believe that we are on the right track. A huge amount of trouble is being caused in two respects. Firstly, we are increasingly hearing complaints from medium-sized companies that the amount of red tape involved in public procurement is so great that they are no longer taking part in the process for that very reason. This is why it is very important to reduce the levels of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is essential that the organisations which issue the calls for tenders are not obliged to choose the cheapest quotation. Instead, they should be allowed to select the most cost-effective quotation. I would like to suggest that there should be a precise definition of what the most cost-effective quotation is, because it is important to remember that the other party, which fails to win the contract, can submit a complaint. For this reason, we need clear guidelines and clear definitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be conducive to the sustained growth of employment, to innovation and to the development of research projects. The economic crisis has, to a large extent, resulted in the prioritisation of financial criteria over quality criteria during the process of selecting offers.</p>
<p class="contents">An interesting solution, therefore, could be the proposal to introduce an obligation to award contracts to the most economically advantageous offers, thus ensuring the optimum use of funds. The guarantee of transparency, non-discrimination and competitiveness is a core principle underlying public procurement regulations. The Commission’s support for the process of awarding public contracts by way of promoting tried and tested procedures and methods and organising the exchange of experience and training programmes could also contribute to increasing the quality of public contracts. Worthy of note are the proposals to simplify the procedures in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the rule which will require original documents from successful tenderers only.

In my constituency of the East Midlands, the UK Government has recently chosen to award a major train-building contract to the lowest cost supplier, using the procurement rules to justify this.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision means that 1 400 people at the Bombardier site in my constituency will become redundant. Indirectly, many thousands more will lose their jobs. This is a clear illustration of why the directive needs reform. We want all procurement rules to drive up standards and encourage sustainable, inclusive growth. To achieve that, the lowest-cost-only option needs to be the exception to the rule and social, economic and environmental criteria must become the norm. New legislation alone is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is failing to make sure that public authorities make full use of this legislation. I have asked the Commission to confirm that EU rules did not oblige the UK Government to make the choice that it did and they have failed to reply to me, although the deadline for response was over two weeks ago. The Commission must do more to make public authorities aware of the full extent of what they can do under EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While respecting this principle and our citizens who have decided to exploit its benefits, we must ensure that in the European Union, there is no discrimination against workers from any of the Member States.

The freedom to provide services remains one of its chief principles. As practice shows, the provision of cross-border services continues to be an enormous problem. It is therefore important to intensify cooperation between the Commission and individual Member States in order to establish an efficient operating mechanism for this aspect of the Services Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must also be informed in full about the progress of this work. The mutual evaluation process itself seems to be playing a positive role. I agree, however, with the need to make the provisions more precise, and with the call for the mutual evaluation to take place following full implementation of the directive. I also regard as beneficial the proposal to extend the use of the mutual evaluation method to other framework directives. It could prove to be an important tool for monitoring the implementation of provisions in individual Member States. I therefore support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Italy, and I think it is also the case in other Member States, there is no legal requirement to register cohabitation, even if the set-up is the same as that of a normal family.

The European External Action Service (EEAS) has been operational for less than a year, and it is understandable that there may be unforeseen cases that require an amending budget. Although we hear criticisms in the press about difficult working conditions in the EEAS, I believe that the European Parliament, having actively supported the idea and setting-up of the EEAS, should support it through this period, particularly because the proposed modifications to the establishment plan will not require additional spending, but will facilitate the implementation of the obligation of at least one third of the staff at Administrator (AD) level coming from the Member States at any given time. As for the amending budget requested by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), it is rather odd that the European Parliament had to decide to establish a higher category of post in order to promote a specific person. I believe that the solution proposed by the rapporteur is appropriate at this stage.

According to the Commission proposal, the EDPS budget should be amended by deleting an AD 14 post and, at the same time, creating an AD 15 post in the establishment plan of Section IX. At a time when the EU budget is overstretched and far-reaching austerity measures have been introduced in the Member States, it was important for us to oppose this proposal. In the case of the EEAS, there has been a request to turn 40 temporary posts into permanent posts over time.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the implementation of a Council Decision which requires staff from Member States to represent at least one third of all EEAS staff and temporary posts to be gradually transformed into permanent posts. The Committee on Budgets monitors increases in the staffing levels of the EEAS very closely and always takes a highly critical approach. However, it is worth noting that the creation of a completely new organisation of this size within the EU will result in changes to the establishment plan which need to be taken into consideration. Therefore, I have also voted in favour of this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to information provided to the European Parliament, since Parliament decided on 10 May 2011 to postpone its decision on granting the College discharge in respect of the implementation of its 2009 budget, one positive point is that the new administration and management of the College have taken measures to eliminate its deficiencies in response to Parliament’s request for action over the serious irregularities in the implementation of the 2009 budget. Since 2010, the College has increased its financial discipline and internal control. The College has developed and implemented its procurement manual for internal use as requested by Parliament in previous discharges in respect of the implementation of the budget. The College has also established an organisational risk register as part of its ongoing budget management to mitigate its risk of under-spending. In its report on the College’s Multiannual Action Plan (MAP) for 2010-2014, the Court of Auditors stated that the College is progressing according to the milestones established in its MAP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court of Auditors, in its report on the annual accounts of the College for the financial year 2009, qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, and the European Parliament subsequently decided to postpone its decision on granting the Director of the College discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for 2009. However, the new report submitted now proposes granting the discharge, and there are no motions for amendment preventing this. Despite the fact that the description in the progress report on the implementation of the College’s Multiannual Action Plan remains fairly general, it gives a clear overview of the status of the different milestones and should thereby serve as a satisfactory basis for informing different stakeholders. The enhanced transparency provided by the current Director and his management team has led to an improved understanding of the challenges the College is facing and has fostered the necessary changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft report generally recognises the big improvements made in the college’s management over the past two years. Two amendments were passed, asking for the College’s relocation and for its merger with Europol in The Hague for efficiency reasons – going beyond the remit of the Committee on Budgetary Control, as decisions on the location of agencies and other bodies are made by the Member States.

It is clear that price should not be the only determining factor – social aspects and the issue of sustainable job creation are now extremely important. In the Slovak Republic, for example, unemployment is now at a six year high. The unemployment rate in Slovakia has risen to 13.73%, and the situation will probably not improve next year, due to the expected slowdown in economic growth. One of the problems of public procurement is the large number of subcontractors, which ultimately causes confusion and a lack of transparency. It is therefore necessary for procurement bodies to be notified in advance of all details relating to the use of subcontractors. We must therefore approach this modernisation in a systematic way, putting the emphasis on sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, efforts to cut spending were demonstrated by CEPOL at its 25th governing board meeting in June 2011, during which it was decided to abolish all its committees by 2012 and to critically analyse all its working groups.

In the second half of 2011, the agency submitted a report to Parliament on the level of implementation of the IAS recommendations, stating that, a significant proportion of the ‘very important’ recommendations on human resources management, administrative procedures relating to selection and internal control standards had already been implemented or were being implemented. Moreover, the agency has begun to develop an action plan on improving procurement procedures. It has also rectified the deficiencies identified by the IAS concerning contract agent selection.

The discharge authority subsequently received replies from the agency following Parliament’s resolution of 10 May 2011, and in its replies, the agency provided updated information on the implementation of recommendations. In light of the second report of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency was granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for the financial year 2009</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge authority shall continue to carefully monitor, during the upcoming discharge procedures, the level of implementation of the measures undertaken to address the agency’s serious weaknesses disclosed by the reports from both the Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service. It is therefore desirable for the agency to continue informing the discharge authority of the measures implemented and their results, and always to submit the requested documents on time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems experienced by CEPOL and the European Medicines Agency in obtaining discharge have had a decidedly negative impact on the way that these agencies are perceived by us, the Members of the European Parliament, and also by European citizens. In my opinion, in order to regain public confidence, the European Medicines Agency should comply with all of the recommendations of the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to congratulate the agency on the efforts that it has made to improve its operations, namely, the implementation of the three recommendations resulting from the 2009 audit by the Internal Audit Service on Human Resources Management.

These were part of the amendments which I tabled and were adopted during the vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control and integrated in the final report voted on today by the Plenary. As Parliament’s rapporteur for the 2010 discharge of the EU Agencies’ budgets, I will closely monitor the European Medicines Agency and look, in particular, at conflicts of interests and cost-efficiency criteria in each and every EU agency.

The EMA is the agency responsible for the scientific analysis of requests to authorise the bringing onto the market of medicines introduced at EU level. In 2009, the EMA budget was EUR 194 million, with 18.52% financed by the European Union and the remainder obtained through fees paid by pharmaceutical companies for services provided. In the report on the EMA’s accounts for the 2009 period, the Court of Auditors expressed reservations about the legality and regularity of transactions, leading the European Parliament to postpone the decision to discharge the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2009. I agree with the decision to grant the Director of the EMA discharge on the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009, and I support the closure of the accounts for the financial year 2009, given that the EMA has provided the discharge authority with up-to-date information on the level of application of the Internal Audit Service’s recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main errors are to be found in Annex II and Annex V.

In Annex V, there were several errors as regards the marking of expressions – they should have been identified with markers. The Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission has agreed that these proposed corrections do not in any way change the substance of the existing text, but only make it more accurate and precise.

The directive in question has repeatedly been amended in a fundamental way. I firmly believe that this directive should be codified, in the interests of clarity and transparency. It is one of the independent directives of the EC type approval system established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles and laying down the technical regulations which motor vehicles and their trailers must fulfil, and also applying, among other things, to tyres.</p>

<p class="contents">I welcome the recent Commission consultation on ADR. Compared to courts, ADR schemes are cheaper, quicker and less formal, offering practical solutions. As ADR forms part of a general ‘justice-for-growth’ agenda across sectors, we, Members of the European Parliament, believe that any approach to ADR should go beyond consumer disputes so as to include disputes about business-to-business, civil and commercial transactions, irrespective of whether they are carried out between private or public undertakings, as well as family disputes and cases of defamation or cases involving parties whose legal status differs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, on-line shopping is increasing and ADR could play a more relevant role here because the scope for judicial action is sometimes limited when dealing with new technologies. Parliament stresses the need to ensure that European consumers can access ADR systems for transnational as well as national disputes, especially in the on-line market, which is growing rapidly in the EU. I support the rapporteur’s position that the use of ADR systems affords a higher level of protection of consumer rights, while also promoting cross-border trade and increased prosperity for all operators in the EU market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, a huge number of consumers and companies are hesitating about carrying out cross-border transactions due to being afraid that they will not be able to resolve adequately any disputes they have. However, this reluctance to carry out cross-border transactions is depriving consumers and companies of the benefits of a competitive internal market. We need dispute resolution mechanisms to be quick, efficient, independent and, most of all, as cost-effective as possible. This would give them a real advantage over judicial proceedings, which are long and costly. Furthermore, promoting ADR will also help streamline the operation of the judicial system as some cases will be resolved through mediation or arbitration. The prerequisite for achieving this is obviously that these alternative mechanisms are promoted in the appropriate manner by informing consumers and companies about them, so that they are used more widely. Therefore, I think that it would be desirable for us to have a legislative proposal from the Commission as soon as possible which complies with the guidelines in this report, so that all EU citizens can have access to ADR mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that alternative dispute resolution methods could constitute a rapid and economically advantageous alternative to current legal practice. It is important to reinforce public confidence in the internal market, and in the application of laws in case of international dispute, by adopting the necessary legislative measures for ensuring the uniform development of these systems throughout the EU. An approach that balances the use and flexibility of alternative dispute resolution systems must be ensured, on the one hand, and the guarantee of protection of consumer rights and their access to fair, confidential, impartial, transparent, quick and effective procedures, on the other: this will undoubtedly bring benefits to the EU economy. It is also important to ensure periodic monitoring and assessment of alternative dispute resolution bodies by independent evaluators. At the same time, public information campaigns and pilot projects must also be undertaken, ensuring that businesses and consumers in general are provided with adequate information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In response to Parliament’s request that it table a legislative proposal on the use of alternative dispute resolution in the European Union by the end of 2011, the Commission has included it in its Work Programme 2011 and in the 13 April 2011 communication as ‘one of the twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence, with the aim of consumer empowerment’. This report on alternative dispute resolution in civil, commercial and family matters includes a series of proposals whose purpose is for European citizens to be able to access a faster, more accessible and cheaper form of justice by means of a conciliation process. In addition to their cross-border nature, alternative methods of dispute resolution should be undertaken on-line, since Internet purchases are increasing exponentially. I am pleased to note the prospect of extending alternative methods of dispute resolution to small and medium-sized enterprises. I welcome the adoption of this report, and hope that all the Member States will very soon be able to transpose the framework directives on alternative dispute resolution into national law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The concepts of freedom, security and justice also need to meet the requirements of citizens and businesses through a simpler and more comprehensible form of application, thereby also improving access to justice. The aim of alternative means of dispute resolution is to strive for the restoration of legal peace or the resolution of disputes between parties. Alternative dispute resolution helps consumers and businesses to resolve conflicts through a third party by an out-of-court route, and thus becomes an effective alternative to the judicial process, particularly in terms of cost. It is a sad fact, however, that Member State citizens are relatively unaware of the existence of alternative systems for dispute resolution. Moreover, only a small percentage of citizens know how to submit an actual complaint to an alternative dispute resolution body.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we must try to educate and inform the public about the possibility of resolving disputes through alternative mechanisms to judicial proceedings. These also offer the possibility of avoiding a directly confrontational approach and, at the same time, provide a possibility for dispute resolution that is advantageous to both parties. However, we absolutely must strive for an approach which takes account of the scope of alternative dispute resolution system powers, on the one hand, and of fair procedures and proceedings in relation to the parties involved, on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the September part-session, I emphasised the benefits arising from the directive on mediation, and today, I would once again like to stress the importance of these undervalued, but very effective, tools in the out-of-court settlement of disputes. Citizens should have guaranteed access to justice, but, at the same time, they have to be properly informed and encouraged to use alternative solutions, which are not only much cheaper, but also significantly faster.</p>
<p class="contents">Great Britain is currently the European leader in the use of ADR methods. Since March 2001, all government agencies have been required to use ADR in all relevant matters, if the other party agrees to take part. In its published report for 2002-2003, the Department for Constitutional Affairs states that the use of ADR by government agencies rose by over 1 200%.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I encourage the Member States to follow the example of Great Britain. At the same time, I appeal for clear steps to be taken in order to evaluate ADR bodies, to improve information programmes, and to conduct campaigns promoting this method of dispute settlement to consumers. I agree with the rapporteur’s position regarding the minimum standards of ADR and the use of best practice models, as well as greater transparency of proceedings and their promotion by European Union information bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that ADR systems like the SOLVIT network have proven successful in solving problems affecting citizens. Nevertheless, the ADR landscape of Europe remains largely fragmented. I am convinced that any future Commission action plan in this respect should secure a new citizen-based ADR structure built on the principles of transparency and proportionality. It is also possible for us to work with the existing structures we currently have at our disposal, such as the ECC-Network and FIN-Network centres. Additionally, the usage of small claims tribunals in various Member States remains significantly low and therefore, this aspect must be taken into account by the Commission when formulating its proposal on ADR. It is vital to note that for any final EU-wide ADR package to be endorsed by the European citizen, this must factor in the existence of an EU-wide collective redress system, and therefore I urge the Commission to firmly put in place this mechanism by 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that legislative measures adopted at EU level will facilitate the implementation of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and encourage natural and legal persons to use it more often, especially in relation to cross-border disputes. The Commission is therefore urged to submit a legislative proposal on the use of ADR in the EU by the end of 2011 and it is emphasised that it is important to adopt this proposal swiftly. I am convinced that it is necessary to encourage the use of alternative means of dispute resolution which are accessible, easy to use, effective and cheap, and which make it possible to establish and maintain quality and trust-based commercial, economic, social and neighbourly relations and to contribute to a high level of consumer protection in a win-win situation, with benefits for both sides as compared to current judicial practice. On the basis of the data collected and a solid impact assessment in compliance with the improved regulation rules, the Commission must explore laying down minimum standards of ADR across sectors, while developing existing schemes and encouraging Member States to also increase funding in sectors covered by schemes, bearing in mind that, although it provides parties with a low cost alternative, ADR must not be ‘justice on the cheap’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alternative dispute resolution, in the way in which and for the disputes for which it is proposed, aims to optimise the efficient dispensation of justice, harmonise the rules of alternative dispute resolution in the common market, for the benefit of parties at European level, and speed up proceedings.

<p class="contents">Justice is a fundamental right, and expedient access to it across the EU Member States’ borders is essential in order to consolidate undertakings’ and consumers’ trust in the internal market as a safe environment in which to do business and to shop. However, in contrast to the approach taken in the Commission’s consultation, our contention is that the scope of alternative dispute resolution should not be confined to commercial matters. Our constituents are citizens, not merely consumers. Other civil matters, including family disputes, increasingly extend beyond the borders of individual Member States, as our citizens enjoy the dividends of European integration. Common standards for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, especially as regards impartiality, transparency, fairness and confidentiality, are key to establishing easy and trusted access to justice across the EU, and they need to be underpinned by cross-border enforceability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, the EU has been seeking for a long time to prevent the emergence of cases of accountability vacuum resulting from the existence of legal systems that are very different from each other: such vacuums contribute, in the end, to exacerbating the lack of trust between the citizens of the various Member States. These problems have also been exacerbated by the volume of cases passing through the courts in all the Member States. Put simply, in addition to our being confronted with very different legal systems, on the one hand, the legal systems themselves have been functioning increasingly less efficiently, on the other. Alternative means of dispute resolution could therefore play an important role: at a time when court involvement is resulting from such diverse demands, it is right that the public justice system should offer means that manage to ensure the stability and security of the various relationships and legal peace between stakeholders on a case-by-case basis.

Two elements of this report seem essential to me. Firstly, the text issues guiding principles to be respected in the area of the ADR systems introduced in Europe. Among them, the independence and impartiality of the mediators, their competence, as well as the guarantee of a very reasonable cost – or even no cost at all – for the consumer who uses this system, are fundamental points in my view. Furthermore, the development of these systems only has meaning if, at the same time, citizens are more aware of their existence. The report also stresses the need to devise communication campaigns around ADR. To my mind, this is vital. Finally, the text points out that ADR and collective redress, far from being mutually exclusive, complement each other. Given how committed I am to the implementation of collective redress at European level, I am glad that this idea is mentioned in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a step in the direction of suggesting non-judicial alternatives for claiming rights and resolving conflicts. Notwithstanding the existence of various instruments in the legal systems of the Members States, which often enable a dispute to be resolved in a less costly, more timely and less stressful manner for both parties, European citizens and businesses have no confidence in these mechanisms. Arbitration, mediation and all types of out-of-court negotiation are still not very well known, and therefore do not enjoy the confidence of the public. The opinion that a settlement reached in this way will not be legally binding is widespread, which also mitigates against more extensive use of these instruments. Consensual dispute resolution is, in my opinion, an appropriate alternative for a whole variety of conflicts, including the very sensitive area of family law.</p>

These proposals, however, cannot undermine the diversity of the system and the need to safeguard the principle of flexibility in responding to citizens’ problems.

The report in question looks at the application of specific emission stages for narrow-track tractors, that is to say, those used in orchards and vineyards. Given that the size and manoeuvrability of these tractors are determined by the layout of the crops, an increase in their size or reduction in their manoeuvrability would, in my view, risk depriving the most advanced and productive area of European farming of its main mechanisation tool.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with this report when it recognises the technical impossibility of installing compliant engines in narrow-track tractors, especially in stages IIIB and IV of Directive 2000/25/EC, because this would alter their operational functionality. I furthermore welcome the rapporteur’s request that the industry should be given more time to bring itself into line with the new engine standards. Finally, I hope the directive being debated will be swiftly adopted in order to clarify the mandatory machinery requirements for the industry in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are limits on emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates and, in future, this will be regulated by several directives which will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and on 1 January 2014. The directives on emissions limitations apply to agricultural tractor engines as regards limiting the amount of emissions they produce. Currently, one of the biggest problems is the fact that if tractor manufacturers installed after-treatment systems in engines, then they would not be able to ensure that the vehicles would meet the operational requirements in terms of size and manoeuvrability. This document therefore requests that narrow-track tractors be either completely exempted from the scope of the requirements of the new directives or that their entry into force be postponed for at least five years. The consolidation of an exemption would be a better solution because the directive on limitations on transport emissions that will come into force would thus help to reduce atmospheric and noise pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In complete compliance with the European policy to fight for emission reduction, which needs to be developed, the current unusual situation in the economy in general, and the sector in particular, fully justifies the decision to postpone the application of the standards for three years.

Tractor manufacturers cannot install engines equipped with after-treatment systems while, at the same time, ensuring the vehicles meet the operational requirements, in terms of size and manoeuvrability, which are the essential elements of such vehicles’ design.

At the same time, we need alignment of Member State legislation to harmonise emission limits and type approval procedures as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also welcomed approval of the priorities identified by the amendment on Original Equipment Manufacturers, especially the reference to the economic estimates, because I believe they are crucial to optimising market flexibility. Given the long-term strategic importance of this matter, the decision not to burden small and medium-sized enterprises excessively, thus giving major manufacturers too much of an advantage, and hence to pursue our general interests, is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A revision of the directive in 2004 (2004/26/EC) introduced the current limits for exhaust emissions for the current stage, and set deadlines and limit values for the next stage. Application of these stricter limits began in January 2011. The machinery to which the directive applies includes various types of machinery used, for example, in construction, forestry and agriculture. It also applies, however, to locomotives, railway vehicles and inland waterway transport vessels. The 2004 directive also introduced a flexible system allowing producers to place on the market, between two consecutive stages of exhaust gas emission limit values, a limited number of machines fitted with engines which still conform to the exhaust gas emission limits of the previous stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The limit is established either as 20% of the machines from the total annual sales of a producer, calculated on the basis of a five-year average of the producer’s total sales, or as a fixed set number of machines. The option of a fixed set number is intended for smaller producers. The directive is an important component of the EU’s current environmental legislation, is of major benefit in terms of emission reduction, and in revising the directive, we should try, in my opinion, to achieve a balance between the relevant requirements and the legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 2004 revision of Directive 2004/26/EC introduced the current emission limits of stage IIIA, and set the deadlines and limit values for the subsequent stage IIIB.

Machinery covered by the directive includes various kinds of land-based machinery intended for construction, forestry and agriculture, for example.

It covers a great variety of machinery manufacturers (an estimated 1 500 companies), many of which do not produce the engines used in these machines. The engines are only produced by a few large companies. I believe that, as a result of the crisis, companies will be unable to implement the requirements, hence the proposal to permit the manufacture of engines until 2014 by increasing the percentage under the flexibility scheme, i.e. the Commission proposes increasing the percentage from the current 20% to 50%.

From autumn 2008 onwards, most of the EU-based industry producing non-road mobile machinery has been affected by the crisis, and especially the construction and agricultural sectors have suffered from steep decreases in sales. The Commission argues that the compliance costs required to reach the new stage IIIB are too high to bear for an industry severely hit by the crisis. The economic crisis is a reality, but there are already signs of recovery. As the sales are picking up, the rationale for the Commission proposal is diminishing. As for some of the bigger producers, for whom the data is more readily available, the sales seem to be smaller when compared to the years which could be called a sort of a boom for the industry – the current sales numbers are, however, not much smaller when compared to years preceding the boom. All in all, as the legislation and the limit values for new stage IIIB has been in place since 2004, followed by some considerably strong years for the industry, the claim of lacking resources for development loses ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking account of the technical adaptation efforts involved in a regulation of this kind, a flexibility scheme was introduced, seeking to reconcile the goal of meeting the proposed targets with the need to offer companies a period in which to reshape their production processes. Meanwhile, the European Commission has proposed an expansion of the flexibility scheme, alluding, in particular, to the problems being experienced by the industry as a result of the economic crisis. In accordance with the rapporteur’s explanatory statement, I believe that we should not abandon the envisaged model, notwithstanding the possibility of expanding the scope of the flexibility scheme in some special cases.

The Commission proposes increasing the already permitted flexibility for manufacturers to place on the market 20% of engines that do not comply with the emission limit values to 50% in order to mitigate further the economic costs on the grounds of the economic recession.

As NOx and PM emissions are the main sources of air pollution, it is important to take action in this sector. This directive was amended in 2004 to allow engine manufacturers a flexibility scheme in stages.

The differences in terms of employment and poverty between people with a disability and those without are very marked and remain unacceptable: only 30% to 40% of them are in employment, and 70% live in poverty. The own-initiative report by Ádám Kósa has the merit of focusing on the situation of these people in the EU. Much remains to be done. Although 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, poverty was clearly on the rise, and social exclusion potentially affects a larger section of the population than before in the EU. We must therefore remain alert: progress, in terms of social inclusion of people with disabilities, will first require the adoption of the ‘horizontal’ directive on combating discrimination.

In my opinion, the report aptly identifies the importance of increasing the mobility of people with disabilities by eliminating physical and social obstacles which prevent disabled people from using public buildings and public services, such as public transport, information technology and other measures and services. I also agree with the idea raised by the report that we should collect specific data on disability issues and disability-related services in the Member States, including data on residential institutions and the quality of the services they provide. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the high level of unemployment is the greatest obstacle to the inclusion of disabled people in society, and that unemployment among disabled people arises because of insufficient preparation for the labour market. In every Member State, it is also necessary to evaluate the situation faced by people with disabilities in the labour market (explaining the reasons why they lose incentives to take up employment), to help them to integrate into the labour market by using the European Social Fund (ESF), and to enable employers to create jobs for people with disabilities. This report stresses that the Member States should provide general information for families raising children with disabilities, guarantee financial assistance, social and health care services, psychological support and more flexible working conditions for parents (or one of them) with children with disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the majority of cases, social policies relating to disabled people fall under the competences of the Member States, so it is crucial that they support the adoption of measures and instruments suited to the needs of the disabled in order to ensure that these people enjoy a greater level of autonomy, equality of opportunity and an active life.</p>

The social exclusion of the disabled, together with the associated lower rates of employment, to my mind cause serious prejudices to the civil and human rights that should be guaranteed to all citizens without distinction. In this regard, it is necessary, on the one hand, to remove the barriers that cause the exclusion of people with disabilities, and, on the other, to adopt measures that will help them enter the job market. The protection of their rights is an important step towards a better implementation of the European Disability Strategy, and towards the employment objective laid down by the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging the mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities is an important weapon in the battle against the poverty many of them experience due to the lack of employment.

The problems experienced by disabled people, as well as the defence of the rights of children and all vulnerable people, have merited particular attention from the European institutions, in general, and particularly the European Parliament. What is really at stake here is improving their quality of life. Many are victims of social exclusion and employment rates amongst disabled people are very low. Some countries have been implementing a range of best practices which urgently need to be disseminated to and reproduced in other Member States. Fundamentally, we need to improve their access to the labour market and their mobility conditions. There is a need to invest in their education and professional training, making use of the structural funds available.

I firmly believe that preference should currently be given to long-term investments benefiting the disabled, rather than short-term, one-off expenditure. I personally believe it is essential to provide the disabled (regardless of their degree of disability) with help according to their individual needs. At the same time, it is essential to try and create the conditions for there to be as little need as possible for individually-tailored assistance in a truly barrier-free environment. Even though we talk about integration in the sense of integration into society, these people are already fully-fledged members of society. We must strive, however, for their integration through acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">Opportunities are equal if the same efforts lead to similar results given appropriate, specified conditions and means. It may not be entirely possible to apply some kind of unified model for all Member States as far as the possibilities for study, employment, freedom of movement or various activities are concerned, as the barriers facing disabled people vary in individual cases. One aspect, however, should be common: the provision of adequate arrangements and guarantees relating to disability, helping towards a full role within society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People living with disabilities represent more than 16% of the European Union’s total population and are one of the most excluded and vulnerable groups in society, with a poverty rate higher than 70%. The new European Disability Strategy advocates that people with disabilities should be active participants in European society and should fully enjoy their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that, despite all the Commission’s and the Member States’ efforts, people with disabilities continue to face barriers and have limited access to goods and services in everyday life. With this in mind, the EU and its Member States should not underestimate the magnitude of the problem – especially in the current economic situation, which compounds the negative impact on people’s lives, in particular, among marginalised groups. The EU and the Member States, taking into account the needs of people with disabilities, should purposefully promote anti-discrimination policies and active social inclusion, in order to guarantee that people with disabilities enjoy universal, effective, equal and non-discriminatory access to high-quality public services by facilitating their mobility and their access to employment, health care, education, training and other tools for independent living. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report also highlights the need to ensure in a universal, effective and non-discriminatory way that disabled people have access to social protection, social benefits, health care and education, since being part of the working population and having financial autonomy are important factors for social integration. Finally, other measures are also put forward: the creation of a ‘European Disability Board’ in order to assess progress of the European strategy, the adoption by the Member States of sign language as an official language, the adoption of a European mobility card so as to reduce the obstacles to freedom of movement (to study, work, travel, etc.). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People with disabilities constitute a vulnerable group, among whom the rate of poverty is 70% higher than average. The rate of employment for people with disabilities is only around 45%, and we know very well that high-quality jobs ensure economic independence and foster personal achievement. As is known, unemployment increases the risk of poverty and social exclusion because at least a quarter of the population suffers from mental health problems at least once during their lifetime, and for 10%, these can turn into chronic mental health problems. We should underline the need for active and targeted policies to combat this persistent situation. The higher risk of poverty experienced is often the result of limited access not only to employment and training but also to health care and appropriate treatment. The Europe 2020 strategy target of achieving a 75% rate of employment among people of working age between 20 and 64 cannot possibly be achieved unless this includes people with disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The adoption of a first European directive requiring employers to undertake ‘reasonable adjustments’ is proof that European involvement can achieve something, especially in countries where disability is not yet properly taken into account.

<p class="contents">In the report adopted by the European Parliament today on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities, many measures have been proposed which will contribute to the development of more specific measures intended to improve the situation in which disabled people live. We must not, however, forget two important matters: the necessity of including disabled people themselves in the process of making decisions which directly affect them and the fact that in many cases, it is actually at the level of Member States and not the level of EU institutions that solutions can be found which are best adapted to the needs of disabled people living in those Member States. However, the report which has been adopted today lays great emphasis on creating new legislation at EU level, and this legislation is also to move away from the matter of disabled people themselves and be applied to much broader social groups. Therefore, despite the many good measures which have been included in the report, I abstained from voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Kósa report voted on this afternoon therefore highlights the need to improve the living conditions of people with disabilities. More than anything, this is a matter of human rights, of respect for people who are doubly disadvantaged, firstly by their disability, and secondly by the too numerous obstacles that they face on a daily basis. Disabled people, being more vulnerable, face physical difficulties (such as restricted access to goods and services, and to public transport) as well as social problems (such as minimal employment opportunities and limited access to communication tools).</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this report helps establish a number of objectives to be met by Member States in terms of equal opportunities. They include increasing disabled people’s rate of employment, mobility and participation in public life. The creation of a European mobility card for providing uniform care to people with disabilities or access to services and communication tools for the visually impaired or the hard of hearing would be a significant step forward in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report deals with two major difficulties faced by people with disabilities: mobility on the one hand, and social inclusion on the other. Ambitious policies must be undertaken as soon as possible at European level to give them access to the labour market and real freedom of movement. Mr Kósa’s proposals on improving physical access to public places and on the creation of a European mobility card, introducing disability entitlements and specific support for parents of disabled children, are all on the right track, which I welcome. I also welcome the report’s reference to the challenges posed by an ageing population – the number of people over the age of 65 with a disability will increase over the coming years by 77%.

<p class="contents">Nearly 80% of women with disabilities fall victim to violence. The risk of sexual violence is higher in their case due to their physical, economic, social or mental dependence on other people. In the case of domestic violence, women with disabilities remain with the perpetrator nearly twice as long as people with no disabilities. Women with disabilities suffer double discrimination on the grounds of their gender and on the grounds of their disability. Therefore, public campaigns concerning the situation of people with disabilities and, in particular, of women with disabilities, as well as activities aimed at raising awareness of their situation, are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is important to optimise the use of structural funds in these areas and to increase funding possibilities for such actions in post-2013 programmes.

I believe that the civil and human rights of disabled people should be respected, and that it is appropriate to involve them in the consultation procedures launched by the European Commission, to encourage exchanges on the measures already adopted by the various Member States, to strengthen inter-generational solidarity amongst young people, and to facilitate free movement without barriers. The intention is to provide society with a sustainable vision based on an approach that respects human rights.

Only 16% of people with disabilities work. I agree with the rapporteur that one of the most important objectives of the European Disability Strategy should be to provide more employment for more than 65 million people living in Europe with disabilities. We need to involve them in general economic and social development, otherwise they will remain disadvantaged. The latest study by the International Labour Organisation shows that workers with disabilities would be able to achieve better results if their work was adapted to their competences and opportunities. We cannot discriminate against people with disabilities. The reports of most non-governmental organisations reveal that today’s education and training systems are not adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, and there continues to be a high drop-out rate among students with disabilities. In Lithuania, 52% of all schools lack specialist teachers or speech therapists.

Instead of this, the original text approved in committee was adopted. This includes the requirement for a directive on equal treatment to be implemented as soon as possible.

Mr Kósa rightly emphasises the importance of respecting the rights of disabled people, which, as a result of many different barriers, are not properly upheld. Disabled people are more at risk of poverty, so we must endeavour to create conditions which are as helpful as possible in enabling disabled people to play an active role in life at work and in society in all Member States. In my work in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am reminded daily of the fact that disabled people do not know their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At every railway station and airport in the European Union, disabled people have the right to receive assistance – which is specified in EU law – because of their reduced mobility. Unfortunately, most disabled travellers simply do not know this, and the staff of railway stations and airports do not inform them of the rights to which they are entitled. We should therefore promote the removal of all barriers as well as tolerance towards disabled people as we strive for a fair European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Council Directive 71/305/EEC concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts came into force in 1971. In my view, the anniversary offers an occasion for taking stock and examining where European public procurement policy has succeeded and where it has failed. On the plus side, I believe that European public procurement law has been crucial in making public procurement more transparent and in combating corruption. By contrast, a disproportionate emphasis on legal considerations has meant transaction costs and the expense incurred for external consultancy services have risen. This is a particularly problematic development in times of economic crisis when public budgets are squeezed. In addition, I would like to mention that there are many hurdles for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accessing public contracts, particularly of a bureaucratic nature.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the main issues surrounding the public procurement system was always the simplification of procedures so that they could be used effectively even by buyers with limited resources, and also the regulation of the issue of service concessions at EU level, the mandatory inclusion of social criteria in procurement procedures, and transaction thresholds above which the EU directive would automatically be triggered. With this document, the European Parliament has once again reaffirmed its position that the current regulation of services concessions at EU level is not necessary, while the inclusion of social criteria in procurement procedures should always remain voluntary, but it recognises that the European Commission should draw up improved procurement manuals on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The submitted Green Paper, however, also contains discrepancies. On the one hand, the scope and details of the questions give the impression that implementation of a kind of ‘micro-declaration’ on public procurement is involved, while, on the other hand, many of the questions or submitted proposals are contradictory. For example, quotas or binding targets in public procurement would conflict with the stated aim of simplifying and ensuring greater legal certainty, and would also contribute to greater bureaucracy and the creation of new legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the review of public procurement directives should be based on the need to slim down public procurement legislation and return it to its original essence, so that it guarantees transparency and non-discrimination, while ensuring competition. The main focus should, in my opinion, be devoted to the tendency of public bodies to rely on bureaucratic procedures in the event of legal uncertainty, which leads to risk aversion and, in contentious cases, to the awarding of contracts to the cheapest product or service rather than the most innovative or the best overall bid. This development is particularly problematic in a time of economic crisis and limited public budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Likewise, the issue of subcontractors is taken into account in order to prevent abuse in relation to working conditions and workers’ safety. Nevertheless, there is still progress to be made where European public procurement policy is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission must impose the principle of reciprocity on its trading partners: if the Union agrees to open up its public procurement markets to third-country operators, then European companies should also have access to markets and public works in these countries outside the EU. European companies and employment in Europe must be a priority when business opportunities are looked at. The Commission must ensure that its forthcoming Public Procurement Directive serves the dual purpose of providing more quality jobs and offering quality services to users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the benefits of the application of this legislation in terms of transparency and reducing the price of work done are indisputable, we cannot say that every aspect of it is positive. Indeed, transaction and external consultation costs have increased. At this time of crisis, we need clear rules and transparency in processes, qualification systems, and electronic passes that make companies’ lives easier, cut costs and constitute an incentive for modernisation. The target of 50% of public contracts being awarded electronically by 2010 failed, except in Portugal. There is no justification for companies having to submit around 20 original documents for each call for proposals. There is a need to increase efficiency through the use of e-mail and electronic models. I therefore welcome this initiative to make public procurement policy simpler, more flexible and more modern, and I hope that it will be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises by cutting transaction costs and enabling them to access calls for proposals that they do not currently have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate on this issue in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – which is responsible for the subject matter – is enlightening as regards its intention: to primarily clear the way to a market worth around 17% of overall EU gross domestic product for large European companies – the public procurement market. All the rest is not enough to hide that intention, including all the rhetoric about the social and environmental principles to take into account in public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that public procurement should fully take into account these principles of maximising social wellbeing and protecting the environment – if we are talking about the use of public money, pursuit of the common good should certainly be of paramount importance – we cannot be unaware, as we stated in the debate in plenary, that the prospect of trade opening set out in this report is not the best way to ensure observance of these principles.

However, the creation and development of a European public procurement market, under the specific conditions in which the European integration process is currently taking place, does not safeguard these objectives. At bottom, what is intended with this initiative is to clear the way towards a market worth around 17% of EU GDP for large companies. With the imbalances currently existing within the EU, and the extremely serious situation faced by the weaker economies, public procurement could be geared towards the national preference in those Member States. This would stimulate national production, the activity of small and medium-sized enterprises, and shorter supply chains that are more socially and environmentally sustainable. It would therefore constitute an important instrument for economic recovery for the growth and development that is essential, and would enable the deficits and obstacles faced today to be overcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European public procurement law has been a contributory factor in making public procurement more transparent, combating corruption, encouraging greater professionalism on the part of public contracting authorities and reducing prices, but, on the other hand, the fall in prices has come at the expense of quality and innovation, and an increase in other costs. The Commission’s effort to make public procurement law simpler and more flexible in the EU Member States by means of this revision is therefore to be welcomed. I firmly believe, however, that it should be done in such a way that tried and tested procedures are not undermined. At the same time, I believe we should try to reach a compromise over the resolution of issues such as, for example, the environmental and social challenges in the area of public procurement policy, the quality of the work performed, including appropriate wages, equality and social cohesion, all in the interests of achieving optimal conditions for citizens, businesses, employees and also taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the general principle of public procurement, the lowest price should not be the deciding factor for awarding contracts. The bid that is economically the most advantageous from the perspective of the costs of the services or goods in question should be a more decisive factor.

With regard to the scope of the directives, it should be made clear that the field to which they apply is that of public procurement – a concept defined, according to the most recent European Court of Justice rulings, by the existence of a direct benefit to the contracting authority. I warmly welcome the European Commission’s efforts to involve public contracting authorities more effectively in the pursuit of general social aims, but should point out that the public procurement directives themselves are the main impediment here. Given the major economic problems that public contracting authorities face, there will be little change so long as the criterion of the lowest price carries the same weight in the directives as that of the most economically advantageous tender. Change will come about only if it is stipulated that contracts are to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender (for example, using the ‘apply or explain’ principle) and if the criteria for selecting what is most economically advantageous are made easier to implement. Simplifying the European Union’s public procurement rules and improving access to flexible procedures will help to promote sustainable and innovative procurement. There are various possibilities, including systematic market monitoring, better use of the negotiated procedure with prior announcement and additional complementary measures to improve transparency, and the systematic admission of alternative bids, with bids being considered particularly from a sustainable development standpoint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, as outlined in the text, the European law on procurement turns forty, with reference, in particular, to Directive 71/305/EEC. Implementing a process of public procurement modernisation, including the computerisation of the system, is a complex procedure and requires attention to issues relating to the protection of firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the competition system and a level of operational transparency that will give the procedure a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that reconciling the various aspects of what is a sensitive area (that is, public procurement) is a mechanism that requires careful attention towards all those involved, so as to ensure that rights and obligations are guaranteed. We cannot, indeed, draw up a procurement modernisation plan simply because we are dazzled by the efficacy of words such as ‘sustainability’ and ‘computerisation’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The public procurement directives are in need of modernisation in order to ensure that they focus on the core tasks, which are to ensure transparency, non-discrimination and competition on the market. However, it is important for me to emphasise the fact that more streamlined procurement rules and greater flexibility must not be at the expense of the equal treatment of the tenderers. European procurement law has made procurement procedures more transparent and it has reduced corruption and nepotism and lowered prices, so there is a great deal to be grateful for. So far, so good. On the other hand, the procurement rules have also resulted in a significant rise in transaction costs, one reason for this being that the rules are so complex. These are costs, which, unfortunately in some cases, exceed the savings which can be recovered on tenders for a particular task, and that, of course, is not the intention here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Current practice in this area indicates the need for national criteria to be better aligned with European legislation. The new provisions may create a legislative framework conducive to increasing the access that SMEs have to public procurement by avoiding the introduction of further bureaucratic procedures. I should emphasise how important it is to establish additional criteria for awarding public contracts. The introduction of the ‘most economically advantageous’ criterion will take into account objectives providing economic and social benefits and with less of an environmental impact. Only 50% of public procurement transactions in the EU are carried out online. However, even in this area, there are many flaws in the implementation of an effective e-procurement system.</p>

I support the idea of supranational public procurement. Unified European public procurement rules are making a big contribution towards increasing transparency and equal treatment, but additional simplification of the rules and elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy is needed, so that small and medium-sized enterprises can also gain access.

<p class="contents">European rules on tendering procedures must not undermine workers’ rights and social conditions. When public authorities purchase goods and services to meet our citizens’ various needs, we must not – for the sake of securing the cheapest price at any price – ignore the needs of the workers who provide them. The ‘cheapest tender’ principle needs to be reviewed so as to cover social and environmental criteria, taking into account the full costs of each option presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Decent work standards have to be upheld. Otherwise, when pursuing public interest goals, we risk undermining social conditions. Fair and equal pay and proper working conditions, which safeguard health and safety, are not incompatible with sound financial management. Tender applicants must not be allowed to evade their obligations by hiding behind a chain of subcontractors which can render them unaccountable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consider changes to the current thresholds for supply and services contracts, so as to ensure that charities, NGOs and small local operators are not deprived of access to these markets as a result of legal and administrative burdens which are unjustified in the environments where such organisations operate, and which paralyse them, to nobody’s benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an area where any intervention capable of Union law could have results beneficial to the economy. It benefits not just freedom of competition, but also the taxpayer in general, since it makes the central framework for processing public procurement transparent. However, the highly technical nature of this field has been increasing so-called ‘transaction costs’; in other words, the costs that applicants have to bear in a public procurement process – for example, legal advice – in order to submit an application. The future of this legislation must, therefore, involve simplification. In relation to another area, this path is also justified since it ensures a greater increase in flexibility: instead of the primacy of the best price, the best solution will win.

Making sure that it works optimally is therefore crucial to the European economy. This report, which I support, sets out six priority tasks for reforming current legislation which the Commission should propose in the coming months. One such task is improving SME access to public procurement. With this in mind, Parliament proposes modernising the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) website, supporting the division of public contracts into lots, or promoting the ‘electronic procurement passport’ – which would prove that the economic operator fulfils the conditions required under EU legislation on public contracts. I am very much in favour of this. Among the other objectives, we should also point out that of achieving the best value for money, in particular, by replacing the criterion of lowest price by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender, taking into account the entire life-cycle costs of the relevant goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the anniversary offers an occasion for taking stock and examining where European public procurement policy has succeeded and where it has failed. The EP position is that any revision of the public procurement directives should proceed from the recognition that there is now considerable experience with EU public procurement law in Europe: whereas, in the early days, strictly formalised procedures were necessary in order to bring a certain degree of professionalism to public procurement practice and to accustom the contracting authorities to the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and competition, these things are nowadays common practice. What is required today is a slimming down of public procurement law to refocus it on the core task of guaranteeing transparency and non-discrimination and safeguarding competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs are the backbone of the Lithuanian economy. These companies account for 76% of labour market employment in the business economy, which is as much as nine per cent higher than the EU average. Despite this, according to statistics from the European Commission, compared with the EU average (28% as opposed to 21%), a large proportion of Lithuania’s SMEs experience difficulties in the area of funding. In Lithuania, small enterprises receive a smaller proportion of public procurement contracts than they should if we take into account the share of the economy they represent. This is because today’s public procurement rules make tenders for contracts complicated and expensive. Much more needs to be done to establish a fair and transparent EU regulatory framework which would regulate public procurement and help SMEs obtain better access to public procurement contracts, both in the EU and third countries. I agree with my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the ‘once only’ principle should be applied, according to which authorities should not request the resubmission of proof that has already been submitted during other procedures.

However, I do not believe that we need to review the EU procurement regulations again only a short time after they came into force. Ms Rühle’s report represents a good compromise. Unfortunately, the EU Commission has already decided to submit its proposal for a revision in December. Therefore, it is important for us to express our concerns during the legislative procedure that will follow. Businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, need practical rules which give them the easiest possible access to public contracts. As a result, I do not want to see EU procurement law being overburdened with regulations. We should not be making the rules unnecessarily complex and we should not be introducing large numbers of criteria that are not related to procurement. Involvement in the manufacturing process, as the EU Commission is currently planning, is totally excessive and puts too great a burden on companies.</p>

The economic reasoning for opening the labour markets becomes as clear as ever in the current times.

I welcome the calls for Member States to simplify administrative procedures relating to the right of workers to move freely in order to avoid unjustified, unnecessary or complicated administrative procedures restricting the opportunity to exercise this right. The Commission should carry out in-depth research to identify barriers faced by European Union workers who wish to exercise their right to move freely and evaluate the Member States’ actions in this area.

I therefore voted for this report, which stresses the need to promote information strategies about the rights of migrant workers, and to simplify administrative procedures relating to the free movement of workers. There is also a need for better coordination among social protection systems, in order that previously acquired social rights might be recognised. It is essential to strengthen the current legal framework regarding recognition of academic and professional qualifications. The geographic mobility of young people should be promoted through mobility programmes for the purposes of learning, and the teaching of foreign languages should be actively promoted.

Mobility among Europeans is still extremely low: only 2.3% of people in the European Union reside in a Member State other than their own. However, 17% intend to work in another Member State, and almost half would consider looking for work in another Member State if they were made redundant. These figures show the discrepancy that exists between a so-called integrated single market and a European area of free movement of people and workers where barriers actually still exist. There are many reasons explaining this state of affairs: the barriers are social, linguistic, cultural, legal or even administrative in nature. The objective of enabling people in the EU to take full advantage of the free movement granted to them under the Treaties is yet to be achieved. It hinges on improving the coordination of national systems, whether this is in terms of social security and pensions or in terms of recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications. Too many people in Europe are still hampered in their plans for the future by the lack of coordination and recognition of national rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, when encouraging people to move, we must offer them a guarantee that their rights as workers will not be violated and that they will not be exploited in a foreign country. We must also ensure that people leaving to work in other countries are not forced to waste the education, qualifications and work experience they have acquired and take lower qualified jobs, even if these are better paid. Finally, I called for an evaluation of the situation in countries where, particularly in recent times, the scale of emigration is very significant due to exceptional economic reasons, with many educated and highly skilled work forces leaving such countries. Such mass emigration might cost these ‘donor countries’ very dear in the future, not just in an economic, but also in a social sense.

<p class="contents">The official figures, including those from the European Commission, indicate that workers from Eastern Europe have not caused unemployment and have not put a strain on social protection systems. On the contrary, their arrival has led to economic growth in the destination countries, assessed at one per cent of GDP. It is becoming absolutely vital for all Member States to review their rules on the transitional periods before providing access to their labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the countries still imposing restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians will lift them by the end of 2011, in other words, before the final deadline of 2013 stipulated in the EU Accession Treaty.

The involvement of SMEs will ensure job growth, and dynamic progress here may enable a cyclical migration of workers that will mainly entail improving skills through training, within which new skills will be acquired or existing skills expanded, and also through the maintenance of a competitive environment, leading to better end products. The current situation and the lessons from the financial crisis have brought a new set of opportunities on how to strengthen economic performance again and increase the level of employment. To this end, worker mobility is a very important benefit because it contributes to greater social and economic convergence, and brings lasting shared experience that is beneficial both to employers and employees. The objectives in the area of job creation will also be better achieved if worker mobility is fully implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It takes the view that workers who lose their job as a result of the crisis and of the austerity policies imposed throughout the EU, and to an even greater degree in countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, simply need to migrate. Despite the fact that there are currently too few jobs available at European level, the report fails to understand that promoting worker mobility at all costs conflicts with regional policy and cohesion policy. The purpose of cohesion policy is to support endogenous economic and social development in the poorer regions of Europe, so that people can stay and find work there.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to address unemployment in Europe is to reverse the current policies being applied, which are the cause of mediaeval practices and flexible forms of employment and which are putting wages and pensions at risk. As this particular report has failed to properly map the true causes of unemployment and propose radical and fair ways of reducing it, I voted against today’s motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Living and working in another Member State is a fundamental right of any European citizen, although the figures show that few people – 2.3% – make use of it at the moment. Worker mobility is socio-economically important, for both the EU and the Member States, and also makes a positive contribution to pursuit of the employment targets set in the Europe 2020 strategy. Several obstacles to, and restrictions on, the full implementation of this fundamental freedom still remain, which violate this right and also make it difficult for the EU’s economies to recover. Moreover, they can have counterproductive effects, such as increased illegal work, the exploitation of workers and the expansion of the parallel economy.</p>

For adequate protection of labour rights, the principle of ‘equal pay for the same work in the same place’ must be applied in both national legislation and collective agreements.

There are some well known obstacles to Europeans’ mobility, which urgently need to be removed. Solidarity makes the European Union and the Member States responsible for seeking to promote the mobility of workers and businesses within Europe, and for removing the obstacles that still remain. Given the crisis that the Union is currently experiencing, European workers and their families, as well as the host countries, will have much to gain if they are not overloaded with administrative requirements and are able, instead, to enjoy freedom of movement, of establishment and of the exercising of their professions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its perspective in doing so is not neutral, however. This movement of skilled labour is encouraged, with a view to forcing the workforces of different countries to compete with one another, leading to their devaluation and a levelling down of working conditions. It is no wonder, therefore, that along with mobility measures, the report stresses the need to strengthen the implementation of ‘flexicurity’. The report does not cover key issues such as collective bargaining and the issue of wages in the countries of origin and the host countries, neither does it properly address issues relating to the ‘brain drain’ phenomenon, which is increasing due to the profound crisis in the weaker EU economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, mobility cannot, as this report claims, be regarded as the most effective solution for resolving the unemployment problem. The vision underlying the entire report is that of using the EU’s 25 million unemployed to impose a further devaluation of the workforce on other workers, making the lack of job security, intermittent employment, and structural unemployment widespread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Generally speaking, what we are therefore seeing here is social dumping and other negative consequences of these unwanted migrations. Despite some positive measures which, in general, are nothing more than mere palliatives, the report does not once consider the problem of unemployment and migration as a result of the neoliberal system and the policies which have been followed, nor the issue of collective bargaining and wages in the host countries. Instead, it deems the mobility of workers to be the most effective solution for solving the unemployment problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The old policies are justified and made viable under the influence of the Europe 2020 strategy and its instruments, with well known consequences: labour flexibility and deregulation, and the priority given to deepening the internal market through the liberalisation and privatisation of even more economic sectors. The approximately 25 million unemployed are being used to impose a further devaluation of the workforce on other workers, making the lack of job security, intermittent employment, and structural unemployment widespread, and this report seeks to go further down that wrong track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The free movement of persons is enshrined in the Treaty in order to strengthen a European identity and as a guarantee for the completion of the single market. Member States have the right, however, to retain barriers for a transitional period, in relation to access to the labour market for the new EU Member States. However, concerns from the past related mainly to the fear of a large influx of immigrants, job losses in respect of host country nationals or pay erosion have not come to fruition. On the contrary, there is an evident and clear added value to the benefit of the entire EU. No jobs have remained unfilled, productivity in the Member States has not fallen, and the income of workers who have chosen to provide their services in another Member State has risen.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore firmly consider it very important to encourage worker mobility, and to remove all remaining legal, administrative and practical obstacles to the free movement of workers. Attention should be focused as a matter of priority on creating cooperation mechanisms aimed at preventing the negative impacts of mobility, protecting families with children in particular.

The free movement of workers represents a positive socio-economic example for both the EU and the Member States because it is a milestone for EU integration, economic development, social cohesion, self-improvement at a professional level, combating prejudices, racism and xenophobia, and can help counteract the negative effects of the economic crisis and better prepare us to address the challenges of global change, by engaging all decision-making stakeholders and civil society in dialogue. The Commission must continue to promote labour mobility and present a long-term, comprehensive, multidisciplinary mobility strategy to eliminate all existing legal, administrative and practical barriers to the free movement of workers. There needs to be a consistent, efficient and transparent policy focused on the requirements of the labour market and economic trends. It should be noted that mobility should remain voluntary and that the negative side effects of increased mobility, leading to brain drain and youth drain, as well as the negative impact on family life and children when one or both parents are working abroad, should be better mitigated at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still many barriers on the path to mobility. We need to knock them down. The report calls for a lifting of restrictions that prevent some European citizens from working in another Member State. Another pillar of the report is the call for greater recognition of diplomas so that everyone can put their training to good avail wherever they are in Europe. To facilitate mobility, social security systems and pension schemes need to be coordinated so that workers’ rights are easily transferable. The principle of non-discrimination is also clearly upheld.

In contrast to current misguided impressions, worker mobility does not harm national labour markets in terms of pay erosion or higher unemployment among the local workforce. On the contrary, mobility has a positive impact on productivity growth, which is hugely important in a period of economic crisis. Worker mobility also creates relatively little direct competition with local workers, since it involves jobs in sectors where local workers are either not qualified for the work in question, or do not want to do it.

However, in the interests of democratic development in particular, it remains open to question whether the measures to promote worker mobility, which also go hand in hand with the loosening of family ties, are sensible at all if we look at the bigger picture. In the process of accepting new Member States with low wage levels, transitional periods for the labour market were agreed. Ultimately, a large flow of immigrants from poorer countries into more prosperous regions goes hand in hand with falling wages and job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">When a study reaches the conclusion that, on account of a convergence of labour demand and supply, immigration from low wage countries has no negative effects, but is actually beneficial, I have to ask myself whether this study was only carried out for the labour areas where there has already been massive pressure on prices for a long time on account of (illegal) immigration.

In other words, demand and supply are essentially in equilibrium, and we should not establish barriers to this, because to do so would violate the fundamental principles of the European Union. Of course, the arrival of a large number of immigrants can create problems with integration, especially in smaller societies, but free language instruction and the provision of necessary information are extremely important for their solution.

The equal treatment of employees on the European labour market is one of the most important principles that I support in my role as a Member of the European Parliament. People in the European Union should be able to move to wherever they want, so that they can work wherever they find a job. In the same way, it should not be possible to force people to leave their home country. This is often the downside of workers’ mobility. In Austria, where I come from, a good solution has been found for the labour market and the concept of a gradual flow of workers based on the needs of the labour market has been put into practice.</p>

Solutions need to be provided to the problems encountered by European citizens in this area, particularly with the current economic climate as it is. That is the logic behind the report by Mr Ungureanu, which I endorse. To determine the nature and extent of these problems, the text calls on the Commission to produce a scoreboard presenting the obstacles faced by workers wanting to settle in another Member State. I think that this is an excellent idea. As for what solutions can be provided, better recognition of professional qualification in the EU is absolutely vital. I am also looking forward to the Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposal on this matter.

This principle has been gradually evolving over the last 40 years, and is today enshrined in Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In its communication on reaffirming workers’ freedom of movement, the Commission refers to all nationals of the 27 Member States working in a Member State other than the one in which they were born, including the members of their families. However, some categories of worker such as posted workers, workers from third countries, unsalaried workers and volunteers, are not included. The issue of labour migration in the EU is seen as a potential source of imbalances in national labour markets, so, although it is considered a right, it is possible for Member States to maintain barriers to the free movement of workers on a temporary basis, as regards opening their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States.

The promotion of workers’ mobility throughout the Union is of considerable importance for its function and cohesion. The right of European Union citizens to work in any of the Member States should be a part of yet greater integration between different EU Member States. Therefore, I hope that the European Commission will carefully consider the matter of the need to simplify administrative procedures related to exercising the right to the free movement of workers and that it will also give consideration to the comment in the document which talks about promoting the streamlining of administrative practices and administrative cooperation so as to allow synergy between national authorities.</p>

The report advocates promoting mobility of workers as a major strategy to overcome unemployment, which is a flawed approach: current Member States’ austerity policies contributing to persistent unemployment, promoting mobility by way of temporary emigration of workers from poorer regions to the richer ones, will not overcome unemployment. Such a strategy could instead lead to a process of workers undercutting each other in terms of wages and working conditions. Promoting labour mobility at any cost contradicts regional and cohesion policy aiming at socio-economic development in poorer European regions. The report does not have much to say on improving workers rights under existing policies on free movement of workers. The most severe problems concerning workers’ mobility are currently to be observed under the freedom to provide services and the posting of workers. On these issues, the report has nothing to say. We deplore that the report does not address areas where the real problems occur. We do support some issues addressed, such as ending the transition periods on free movement of workers for Romania and Bulgaria, the need to combat social dumping and undeclared work, and a greater role for labour inspectorates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a novel instrument used for the first time in EU law, and its main objective is to evaluate the state of the internal market for services following implementation of this directive. Consequently, the report not only examines results but puts forward proposals on how to improve this process in the future, above all, giving Parliament an opportunity to evaluate the application of such an instrument in other policy areas. The mutual evaluation process only covered those provisions of the directive which left a certain degree of discretion to the Member States, such as certain provisions concerning the establishment of businesses and the cross-border provision of services. The European Parliament believes that the objectives of mutual evaluation are not yet defined clearly enough, leading to misunderstandings among the Member States, and that more effort is required to make the process transparent. After all, although a certain degree of confidentiality is an important condition for creating mutual trust among Members States, the report proposes ensuring that stakeholders receive regular feedback on the ongoing process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore necessary to clarify that mutual evaluation takes place only after implementation. In my opinion, this sequence is justified, as it was during the mutual evaluation that Member States discussed the changes to their regulatory framework and the requirements maintained, abolished or amended as a result of the implementation of the Services Directive. Thanks to this, the discussions led to a better understanding of the situation in each Member State, and the remaining barriers still in place following implementation of the Services Directive. I consider this a great contribution towards the better assessment of the current state of the single market in services. However, mutual evaluation raised questions as to the transparency of the process and as to whether, or to what extent, stakeholders should be involved in a process that directly affects them. The full and correct transposition of the Services Directive remains the urgent priority, in my opinion. Bilateral meetings between the Commission and the Members States on the implementation of the directive are already taking place, and the Commission should not hesitate to take enforcement measures, where necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overall potential of the common market in services has not yet been fully exploited, and the correct implementation of this directive is undoubtedly a prerequisite for completion of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is necessary to ensure coherence of the implementation of the different pieces of legislation of central relevance to service activities, such as, for example, the new rules for European standardisation, on which I am the rapporteur, which, among other things, will look at the subject of applying standards to the services sector. However, I would like to point out that proper transposition of the directive must not threaten the safeguarding of characteristic national business activities mainly carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission should assess whether the Services Directive may have negative repercussions on SMEs in certain industries – for example, SMEs in the Italian seaside services business – and propose measures to mitigate such repercussions and to ensure that the specific characteristics of certain professional categories are borne in mind when applying the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States have made a significant effort towards implementation. The mutual evaluation process is set out in Article 39 of the Services Directive. It is a tool used for the first time in the EU legal instrument. Its main goal was to assess the state of the internal market for services following implementation of the directive. The article remains vague, however, as to the precise objectives of mutual evaluation. This lack of precision resulted in different expectations and perceptions of process among stakeholders but also policy makers. The common confusion is also to associate mutual evaluation with the work on the implementation and the transposition of the Services Directive. When working on mutual evaluation, Members States have been divided into six clusters of five countries each.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall assessment of mutual evaluation as a policy tool is positive. I take the view that the mutual evaluation process should continue to function in the form of cluster discussions. We must, however, try to increase the transparency of the process.

I agreed with the opinion that the mutual evaluation process in the Services Directive is an important instrument for identifying further initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market for services. The remaining regulatory barriers, such as rules on reserved activities, insurance obligations, legal form and capital ownership requirements, should be eliminated. The focus should be on unjustified or disproportionate requirements which should be abolished in order to guarantee the smooth functioning of the single market and bring the highest level of added value to the functioning of the single market in services. The Commission must therefore continue and step up work with Member States on an individual basis so as to achieve a complete and correct transposition and implementation of the Services Directive in all Member States.

The priority underlying improvement in the mutual evaluation process is the full transposition of the Services Directive in all the Member States and a correct approach to relations between the Member States as regards the issue which is the subject of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this obstacle has been dealt with, it will be necessary to focus on implementing the mutual evaluation process, which is based on the principles of cooperation and communication. However, it is clear that this process must have clear and tangible objectives if it is to be considered a useful evaluation tool that will encourage and increase trade in services inside the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to remove the barriers for service providers posed by national legislation which cannot be justified on the basis of the provisions of the directive. That should help to improve the functioning of the internal market, which will benefit industry and the citizens in the EU. It is a method that we could also use in connection with similar directives in future so that they are implemented in a more uniform manner in the Union’s 27 Member States. However, it is not a tool that should be used every time. It is a cumbersome process, so it is only with regard to the framework directives, where there is a large degree of freedom in terms of how the individual Member States can implement the directive, that it would make sense to use the mutual evaluation process. Otherwise, it would quite simply result in too high an administrative burden for the authorities involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of this monitoring is to detect how the directive has been implemented in the Member States, especially with regard to the realisation of relatively indeterminate concepts, and providing for a wide margin of discretion for national legislators. In this case, this analysis has been confined to certain requirements for implementing the directive. This model should be viewed positively, as it is a means of cooperation between elements from the various Member States, and enables the sharing of best practices and the joint resolution of any additional difficulties that may arise. It should be stressed, however, that the effectiveness of this instrument is, to a large extent, the result of its implementation being restricted to a limited number of elements, so as not to result in a disproportionate increase in the bureaucratic burden falling on national administrations.

The main problems identified relate to the fact that certain rules have not been fully implemented, when these could have contributed to the internal market for services working better, and which have been progressively adopted over recent years. There are also problems resulting from the Member States’ ability to reserve some service activities for certain specific operators, meaning there are 8 000 regulated professions in one or more Member States. There is therefore a need to take further steps towards contributing to making better use of all the potential offered by the internal market for services.

These 20 countries represent 85% of the global economy and two-thirds of the world’s population. The stated objective is to try and find coordinated responses, particularly to strengthen international regulations and financial supervision to correct current imbalances. The G20 leaders are also asked to agree on the minimum common elements of a global tax on financial transactions. As part of a new global regulation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should play a bigger role. It should therefore become more transparent in its operations, with a fairer distribution of voting rights, and a more open procedure for electing its chief executive. Its mandate could be extended, not only to increase international supervision, but also to improve monitoring of those economies that are systemically significant. This new democratic accountability should be required not only of the IMF, but also of the World Bank and the G20. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, drafted by Mr Hökmark, analyses global economic governance and prepares for the next G20 summit, which is a crucial forum for worldwide consultation, replacing the G7, but suffers from a lack of representation for smaller countries. At this summit, the EU should demonstrate that it has a fundamental role in carrying out this governance by tabling a set of measures that foster emergence from the crisis. Demanding greater transparency in international institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), guaranteeing a flow of trade to emerging economies and adopting measures to correct structural misalignments are some of the proposals that the EU needs to advocate.

Many others, however, still face poverty. Social and economic differences between and within countries must be reduced, and Europe’s fight against poverty must therefore be one of the main priorities of the EU 2020 strategy. The US and Europe are still tackling the consequences of the worst international economic recession since the Great Depression. The evolution of the global economy has, in recent decades, been marked by inequalities, and these are still primarily caused by a lack of competition. In view of the high degree of globalisation and the scale of capital flows, these imbalances make new demands on global governance and challenge the structures of existing institutional arrangements. Global imbalances constitute a potential threat to financial and macro-economic stability in the leading economies, and may have repercussions on other economies.</p>

How to use the crisis to further not so honourable ideological goals, without ever really challenging the root cause of what led us to this tragic situation: the finance-driven globalisation of the economy. Yet this is not a scientific phenomenon, nor is it a historic inevitability: it is simply the work of politicians who have taken certain decisions at certain times in history, the first of them being choosing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) over the Havana Charter in the post-war years. A very clear choice in favour of ultraliberalism against regulated trade and the primacy of the political will of States over the commercial interests of the private sector, a choice further compounded by the Marrakesh agreements and the creation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), now run by the socialist Pascal Lamy. This just shows how the pseudo-elites running our States are in collusion. Deglobalisation is therefore a matter of choice. It requires both will and courage against all the lobbies profiteering from the system. In the National Front, we have this political will and courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has an opportunity to take the lead in this area, not only by supporting regulators and improving economic coordination within the Union, but also by working to reform the relevant international organisations and forums, with the aim of making them more effective and responsive when faced with the challenges of living in a globalised economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a plethora of international organisations designed to govern the global economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), alongside the intergovernmental fora of the G7 and G20, of which the IMF and G20 are the most effective bodies, although both still need to be improved and global markets require global rules. Globally, it is recognised that some sectors of the financial industry contributed to the global financial crisis, revealed weaknesses in financial management and deepened the sovereign debt crisis, and there is a broad consensus that the financial sector must bear a greater responsibility, to include covering a certain amount of the losses caused by the crisis. I welcomed this document because the lack of coordinated and effective regulation and supervision of the global financial system led to weaknesses in the financial sector which subsequently exacerbated the vulnerabilities in the global economy, and I therefore believe that decisive action must be taken to prevent a repeat of similar crises in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reforms in global economic governance are essential, but politicians must abide by the law and by agreements that they have signed. Members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must adhere to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. We see how non-compliance with the Maastricht criteria has now placed Europe in a very grave situation. States must abide by their commitments. I also agree that member countries of the World Trade Organisation must do everything possible to develop international trade. At a time of low economic growth, the liquidation of various obstacles to trade could form the cornerstone of powerful economic growth. I firmly hope that the recommendations made in this resolution will be seriously considered at the G20 summit. This is a time of challenge, and the future relies solely on us.

Firstly, greater cooperation is required at an international level, and the ‘emerging powers’ must also accept their responsibilities. It is unconscionable that there should be rules that apply only to Europe, whereas elsewhere it is the Wild West.

It is rightly thought that the highly developed countries are currently experiencing a serious economic crisis. One of its causes has been the lack of the necessary coordination and then of economic governance at world level. It has turned out that leaving everything to the ‘invisible hand of the market’, without state supervision, was a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, a key forum for the exchange of views regarding the global economy is currently the G20. However, this is an informal body and it does not possess features characteristic of an international organisation such as the ability to make binding decisions and supervise their implementation. Another problem of the G20 is the lack of legitimisation from the international community. It seems that it is just an elite club of the world’s largest economies. The fact that the forum does not have broader foundations is a serious obstacle to its credibility, and this is something which should be given due consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally it is worth asking ourselves the question as to whether, in the light of the very different and often conflicting interests of particular states, global economic governance is possible at all. In my opinion, it will be difficult to move out of the structure of simple consultation and coordination of positions at political level, but even this is a lot for a beginning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This must include brave decisions which the international institutions dedicated to the world economy (IMF, World Bank) and the informal forums (G7, G20) have to take. I therefore welcome this report which recommends the drawing up of a tax on financial transactions capable of both limiting high-frequency trading and creating a new source of income for Member States, regulating excessive speculation on the debt of countries in difficulty and increasing control over the ratings agencies which were, in part, responsible for the crisis in 2007. Whilst the EU has decided to show the way forward by now drawing up binding standards for all of these issues, it cannot be alone in reforming the system.

Europe should offer tax breaks and incentives for businesses that provide child care and nursery facilities for children, enabling single mothers to work while their children are being looked after and taught. In addition, tax breaks should be offered to companies that provide training courses to single mothers on the complex situation of managing being a mother and a worker. An example of a similar practice that can be implemented by other Member States is the case of the Netherlands, where childhood assistance is free for single mothers. Flexible job opportunities such as part-time work, tele-jobs, and e-jobs should be offered at local, national, and EU level, so that single mothers can reconcile their private and professional lives. Single mothers should also be offered priority access to affordable housing. Extra unemployment benefits should be allocated to single mothers for each child under their custody. Member States can use Germany as a model for implementing this, where unemployment benefit for single mothers with dependent children has already been increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Policies towards single mothers differ across Europe. The high unemployment rate for single mothers – combined with the gender pay gap – results in their being torn between taking on debt and caring for their children. We must encourage national policies that will guarantee indirect subsidies for the purchase of food. We must provide tax credits for single parents, along the lines of the arrangements that exist in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. A European incentive to Member States that provide health care for mothers and children where the family is below the national average would be a positive step. Flexible job opportunities, including part-time work, teleworking, and e-jobs, should be offered at local, national and EU level to enable single mothers to reconcile their private and professional lives. Germany can be used as a model in relation to increasing unemployment benefits for single mothers with dependent children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Single mothers, whether as a result of divorce or separation, or because they have never been married, are an increasingly large group. In the EU, five per cent of women are single mothers, and the majority are between 25 and 64 years of age. Living conditions for certain categories of single mother could have consequences for their children. These children, who live on fewer resources and have fewer opportunities to access education, could be future victims of poverty and social exclusion. By performing tasks normally shared between two parents, mothers are also more exposed to stress, have less access to health care and are more vulnerable. The Member States should therefore respond to this situation and adopt public policies to support the needs of these families. I should like to draw attention to some of the measures that could be implemented, such as the adoption of the indirect subsidies policy, the guarantee of provision of medical care, the opportunity to opt for more flexible working hours, priority access to social housing, and increased child care facilities. Finally, the exchange of best practices with northern countries should be encouraged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, five per cent of European women are single mothers. When discussing single mothers, we also must not forget single fathers, but in Europe, 85% of single parents are single mothers. I would like to stress that during the economic recession, in nearly all parts of Europe, women who are bringing up children on their own have been worst hit by poverty. In terms of the risk of poverty, it is very important to understand that children cared for by single mothers experience greater poverty than children growing up in traditional families, in which both parents usually work. We also should not forget that not all single mothers can work full-time if their children are very young. We also need to take into account the number of children being brought up by a single mother. So that single mothers can balance their career and family, they need to enjoy flexible working conditions, such as distance working and part-time work, and should be given the opportunity to work flexible hours. Single-parent families should enjoy tax deductions and should be reimbursed for the cost of medical treatment. We also need to set up family centres and initiate special training programmes for single mothers. Priority should also be given to single mothers when obtaining places in nurseries and kindergartens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report contains many interesting findings and ideas on improving the position of single mothers. The report states that five per cent of European women are single mothers. They are burdened, above all, with a high level of unemployment and the cyclical nature of poverty, which affects their children’s access to education. Poor access to education means fewer opportunities to enter the workforce at a competitive level. The health status of single mothers is also statistically more unstable than those of mothers in dual parent families, Often, they cannot afford adequate medical care or proper rest. Statistically, single mothers throughout Europe are less educated then their married counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally consider the ideas for measures making use of experience from other Member States highly useful: the introduction of lower tax on food for single mothers or the provision of tax relief and incentives for companies providing child care facilities in workplaces and crèches, enabling single mothers to work whilst their children learn and are looked after.

The Barcelona European Council called for the provision of child care for at least 33% of children under 3 years and for 90% from 3 years up to school age. However, only five Member States have met these targets. This report calls on the Member States to redouble their efforts and be more ambitious and ensure access to child care facilities for 50% of 0-3 year-olds and 100% for 3-6 year-olds. It also proposes tax breaks for companies that employ single parents and provide child care facilities. The report also addresses the role of the father and shared care, which is very common in some Member States but almost non-existent in others. It urges the Member States to introduce specially designed policies and financial assistance for single mothers and to ensure regular payment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic crisis has worsened the situation of these single-parent families which were already very exposed to insecurity and social exclusion. 85% of these families consist of a woman bringing up one or more children alone. With the knowledge that European women earn, on average, 18% less than men, the fragile situation of single mothers is evident. To confront the problems of the increasing numbers of such families, the resolution adopted by Parliament proposes the introduction of ‘family centres’ that are able to offer them accommodation, advice, and training and education aid. These support measures for single mothers should, of course, be extended to men who find themselves in the same situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, there are increasing numbers of women who find themselves in this situation: unmarried, divorced or widowed women find themselves raising their children and running a home on their own, performing tasks that should be done by two people. Of European women, five per cent are single mothers, who are at increased risk of poverty as a result of the current economic and financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is aware of this problem and, mindful that the problem of single mothers is often linked to child poverty, is committed to eradicating this situation by making it a priority, and by implementing new initiatives in line with the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets as regards poverty reduction, employability and gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need to set up conditions for access to health care, tax incentives for companies and flexible job opportunities.

Europe must take advantage of the newly-created European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius to help alleviate such disparities. European institutions can work to reduce this workplace discrimination by providing tax incentives for employers to encourage the recruitment of single mothers and provide more flexible working hours and child care services.</p>
<p class="contents">While the initiatives put forward by this motion are aimed at helping single mothers, they are not limited to this; most can help single fathers and working-class families in general. I believe it is important for Europe to help support the development of our future generations, and for this reason I have chosen to support this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly at a time of economic crisis, it is necessary to give single mothers additional support, as they experience a three-fold pressure: bringing up their children alone, gender-specific discrimination on the labour market and the pay gap allow women and their children to quickly slip into a cycle of poverty without any prospects of escaping it.

Single motherhood is an often overlooked demographic category since it is very difficult to place a face to the issue. Encompassing ages spanning over forty years and including all socio-economic backgrounds, single motherhood lacks an identifiable, visible lobby that can advocate for all single mothers, since policies affect each mother differently. Geographically across Europe, one can see a difference in the perceptions and policies towards single mothers. In the southern Mediterranean states (Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece), it is generally accepted that extended family will assist in the raising of single parent children on a voluntary basis without reimbursement. In the northern and Nordic states (France, Sweden, Germany, Denmark), government welfare systems are in place to offer single mothers benefits and social assistance policies. In the Eastern European Member States, there is a general mix of policies, some holding on to strong familial values from the Communist regimes and others having a mix of the northern and southern European policies, while the geographic distributions, along with the age and socio-economic divisions, already make it difficult for single mothers to organise and lobby. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the reality that we must deal with: above all, equal treatment must be guaranteed. The fact of having a child and raising it alone must not be an additional handicap for these women who most frequently suffer, rather than choose, this situation. It is important that Member States exchange good practices. Single mothers must have support for access to employment via training policies and measures that facilitate a work-life balance.

However, the pay gap means that the situation is more difficult for single mothers. In European societies, the methods deployed to resolve this issue vary from assistance provided by the extended family to highly developed national social protection systems. However, the threat of poverty remains, with the risk of it persisting in future generations and providing fewer chances for these children to be successful in life. In addition, the social stigma attached increases the risk of children being abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">Possible solutions call for medical care to be provided to single mothers on incomes below the national average and the provision of accessible housing and child care networks in crèches and day centres so that the mothers can continue their careers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, suitable unemployment allowances for single mothers can help provide a decent life for these single-parent families. I feel that the concept of social entrepreneurship is similarly useful. This is a business which tackles a social issue in different areas and involving a variety of target groups.

It is up to the EU, which wishes to ensure compliance with the values of equality, democracy and freedom, to make the Member States who have yet to adapt their economic and social policies aware of these new models of the family.

In Latvia and Estonia, this rises to nine per cent. This is a relatively new social phenomenon. The growing number of single mothers is linked to the devaluation of the family as a basic social cell. I believe that this new social category that is difficult to define must be included in the social security system. However, we should find an optimum basket of support measures – the good proposals set out in the report should not create incentives to put the traditional family in a less advantaged position because we want as many children as possible to grow up in two-parent families. This report is not just about single mothers, but about child poverty, and I therefore welcome the proposals contained in it, which will help prevent children from falling into an inescapable cycle of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the current economic situation, particularly for those Member States which are suffering from emigration, we must promote the involvement of all categories of society in economic growth. Single mothers and fathers form one of these important categories which should receive support and have easier access to the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This marks an historical first, and our consensus over this issue is truly symbolic. I hope the Member States will adopt this standpoint as good advice and will begin to treat this issue seriously. Unfortunately, the number of mothers raising children alone is increasing every day in Europe. In my opinion, the most important change here is to stop traumatising and blaming these mothers. It is not their fault that they have become single mothers. It is almost always a decision of at least two people, and the woman is the weaker one in the relationship. It is therefore important for society to start addressing the issue of how to help them. I consider it particularly important to allow them access to education, or to complete their education, because these are often young mothers who gave birth to a child before finishing school and thus became part of a much more vulnerable group on the labour market – those without education and with a young child. Access to state school and pre-school facilities is also important. I believe that many governments will be sympathetic to this initiative, and will start to implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In applying the best practices, however, one must certainly also take into consideration the distinctive features of the Member States – historical experience and the stage of development when dealing with a particular issue. The offering of tax benefits for single mothers could, for instance, promote the rise of formal single motherhood, particularly in poorer Member States. A system of support measures should, however, be organised so that it precludes abuses. One of the most important questions is, above all, the safeguarding of employment for single mothers, the family’s sole provider and the person upon whom her children’s welfare and future depend. Infant child care must definitely be guaranteed. I consider it regrettable that single mothers have essentially been left alone with their problems in many societies, and they are treated with disregard, even disdain. I support this report, which effectively reveals the main problems faced by single mothers and also proposes the requisite solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For every 20 women in Europe, there is one single mother in need of support. Perhaps this will help to mitigate the tragic reality of abortions. The Member States do indeed need to adopt measures and take action so that single mothers are not at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Clearly, support for the traditional family is needed so that children can develop normally; however, we also need to ensure that the problems facing single-parent families are also addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This particular group is often neglected by public policy in the Member States and socially stigmatised. The purpose of this report is for the Member States, together with the EU, to take concrete steps in the areas of education, health, employment, social security and housing, so as to reduce the associated risks of poverty, social exclusion, and difficulties reconciling work and family life. There is a need to adapt public policy to different models and family situations. According to 2006 data, 32% of single-parent households in the 25 EU Member States were at risk of poverty, as opposed to 12% of couples with children. This is linked to the interruption of studies and the acquisition of vocational skills, to the lack of school infrastructure for children at affordable prices and with timetables compatible with the working day, and to social stigmatisation in some European societies. I believe we must work together and identify best practices amongst the Member States as a matter of urgency, while creating specific support measures for this vulnerable group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to Eurostat data, Lithuania is among those countries with the highest number of single mothers in the EU. In Lithuania, the rate is six per cent, whereas in Greece, Finland and Romania, it is two per cent. One of the things that causes most concern is the poverty of children brought up by single mothers. High unemployment among single mothers prevents us from protecting children from poverty. In Lithuania, the rate of child poverty is almost 22% which exceeds the EU average of 20.3%. Poverty poses a greater threat to children being brought up in single-parent families. According to Lithuanian national statistics, 44% of single-parent families are threatened by poverty. High child poverty in Lithuania is partly caused by low family benefits, which are much lower than the EU average. It is very difficult for single mothers in Lithuania to balance work and bringing up children. According to the European Commission, Lithuania is failing to fully implement one of the Barcelona objectives – child care services only cover nine per cent of children under three and 62% of children between three and school age. I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal to take advantage of the European Institute for Gender Equality, which was recently established in Vilnius. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Single mothers in the EU are, on the whole, less educated than married mothers and developing initiatives to help young pregnant women as they aim to continue their education during pregnancy and after giving birth is an important support mechanism and will provide much needed assistance, especially to those in deprived areas.

<p class="contents">This has been made possible as organised crime has created an approval and support network, involving deep, extensive infiltration of the political world, civil service and legal economy. In Romania, a bill was recently adopted which makes loan sharking an offence punishable with a prison sentence of between six months and five years.

This report, drafted by Ms Alfano, concerns this practice, which is detrimental to the interests of the European public and the EU institutions, and it sets out guidelines which Parliament believes should be followed as part of a better EU legislative framework, with a view to stopping the internationalisation of mafia-style criminal organisations, particularly by strengthening and improving the functioning of European structures involved in this fight, such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and Interpol.

Organised criminals frequently take advantage of globalisation, the abolition of borders in the EU and the legislative differences among the Member States to make increasingly substantial profits whilst, at the same time, ensuring they remain unpunished, and this is extremely serious.

It is true, as has been said in all of the long-winded meetings, trafficking – of drugs, people and arms – is a scourge and the imagination of the traffickers knows no bounds. Once again, though, we come together to attempt to manage, at a European level, problems that would never have existed or would have been far reduced had it not been for the existence of the European Union. Moreover, as regards crime, Member States have not waited for the EU before reacting. The Prüm Treaty illustrates this, even if its content was partially adopted at EU level, resulting, by the way, in its being less effective. However, the issue that particularly motivated our vote against is the intention to give competences in these areas to the planned European Public Prosecutor’s Office. We are opposed to the very principle of this Office and, therefore, in particular, we oppose the possibility of this supranational organisation initiating legal investigations and giving orders to our police services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal framework which currently exists at EU level is not an adequate basis for serious action to tackle the problem, and there is a need for legislation which would, for example, allow so-called ‘extended confiscation’ and action targeting assets registered in the name of front persons and organisations. The Member States must strengthen their judicial authorities and police forces on the basis of the best current experience, also comparing the legislation and resources designed to support their activities, and assigning adequate human and financial resources for that purpose. We must adopt measures in order to address this acknowledged threat to the EU and its citizens, such as setting up a special committee on the dissemination of criminal organisations which operate across borders, including mafias, drafting an impact assessment on the added value of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, improving practical cooperation among police and judicial authorities, preventing companies linked to organised crime and mafias from taking part in public tenders and public procurement management, as well as similar measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a small amount of progress has been made in combating mafia structures in particular. Globalisation and the abolition of internal borders are, unfortunately, exploited repeatedly by criminal gangs on a large scale. In recent years, trafficking, in particular, has become one of the most lucrative branches of organised crime. What gives particular cause for concern is the degree to which Italian mafia organisations and other European and non-European criminal organisations (for example, the Russian, Albanian, Turkish and Nigerian mafia), as well as drugs cartels, have created networks in almost all EU Member States. The EU instruments for combating organised crime are inadequate, particularly when they in fact go hand in hand with continual cuts in personnel in the police force and judicial system.

Therefore, strong, coordinated measures are needed by all the EU Member States, in order to crush a phenomenon that has serious repercussions for the entire community. Criminal organisations do not only carry out more or less visible crimes; they can also attack the heart of the economy in a society and force honest people to suffer unfair competition that puts them out of the market. I have to say, with some pride, that at least in this area, Italy can provide an excellent example to be followed in Europe. Thanks to intensive work over the last three years by our Minister for the Interior, Mr Maroni, we have achieved excellent results. In the last year alone, over 9 000 members of the mafia have been arrested, 32 of whom had been on the run for a long time. In addition, over 4 000 assets with a total value of over EUR 4 billion were seized.</p>

The report also takes into account the external dimension of organised crime. Corruption is deep-rooted in some third countries as a part of the culture of social relations. The EU should not only fully exploit existing instruments to promote the combating of corruption in third countries, but should also ensure that procedures in third countries for the distribution and use of assistance provided by the EU satisfy the high standards of transparency and publicity applied by the EU. It should be noted that as well as greater transparency of procedures and publicity of all information on public finances, public access to data on offences committed and the persons involved would also be an effective measure.

However, there is now an even more complex variable: the economic crisis, which is giving rise to other forms of organised crime which are exploiting uncertainty and insecurity, especially among private individuals. In Greece, for example, which has been hardest hit by the crisis, there has been a rapid increase in blackmail (as much as 50% within a year), in smuggling (up 84.29%) and in counterfeit coins in circulation (up 56.99%).</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime therefore needs an organised response and organised policies on the part of the EU.

<p class="contents">There are two elements on which I wish to comment. Firstly, the need for a directive with the specific aim of taking the proceeds of crime out of the hands of those who perpetrate it is increasingly patent. In Ireland, this step was taken by the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996. Since then, the Bureau has taken more than EUR 129 million out of the hands of criminals and criminal gangs. However, with improved implementation of the principle of free movement of workers and goods, it has become easier for criminal gangs to move money and assets around throughout the Union: hence, the need for a pan-European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would point out that in every part of my home constituency, we face problems with criminal gangs dealing in drugs. As stated in the 2011 Cross-Border Crime Assessment, practically all illicit drugs in Ireland are imported – as opposed to being locally produced – mostly from mainland Europe. There is a need for a fully coordinated European approach which tackles this issue from the manufacturer right through to the pusher on the ground, leaving no link in the chain untouched. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My country is mentioned 24 times in the report, compared to Latvia, which is only mentioned once, and Estonia, which is mentioned three times. Europol states that Lithuanian criminal groups’ wealth has increased their recruitment, infiltration and opportunities to invest. The report describes the important role played by Lithuanian groups in trafficking drugs (including amphetamines, methamphetamines and ecstasy) to EU Member States. They are also involved in the counterfeiting of euro banknotes and cigarette smuggling. As the European Parliament report states, organised crime is a billion euro business in Europe and it is growing. The expansion of trafficking and the opportunities provided by the global economic crisis have made organised crime even more dangerous. The rapporteur suggests several measures – including improving the European legislative framework – to help step up the fight against organised crime at EU level.

At a world level, the EU contributes more than half of official development assistance (ODA). That said, there remains much to be done to deal with the causes rather than the symptoms of poverty around the world. This is an extremely difficult issue. How can we create a development and, especially, a codevelopment policy that is both relevant and provides a way out of poverty for the least advanced countries? High-level conferences and declarations remain focused on the mechanisms for delivering aid when we need to think about drawing up effective development policies. Aid has reduced due to the financial crisis and also due to the noticeable reduction in the level of ODA which, for some fund providers, is lacking in short-term results. We cannot accept this short-term vision which does not match the deep and essentially long-term action which development assistance represents. HLF-4 can only succeed if it achieves a strong commitment from the EU in favour of effective aid, achieved via clear and measurable objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The document notes that recent monitoring studies and assessments have shown that recipient countries have done more than donor countries to implement commitments under development aid declarations and the Accra Agenda for Action adopted previously. In the forthcoming HLF-4, countries are therefore encouraged to debate how it would be possible to increase aid provision transparency and accountability and reduce the fragmentation of the aid provided.

The need for general consensus in joint activities is always advocated in relation to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. In the fight against poverty, it is vital to obtain as much development funding as possible from all available resources. The EU is not only one of the most important donors of official development aid (ODA), but also provides developing countries with an all-round set of measures to support sustainable development, particularly through cooperation with partner countries in creating a strategy for aid provision. Even though ODA is one of the best indicators of official donor commitments, it is not the only source of funding for development. An increasing proportion of total ODA comes from emerging countries which are not members of the OECD. Regardless of this fact, transparency and accountability – both between the governments of donor and recipient countries and between the state and society – are prerequisites for aid effectiveness.</p>

It is regrettable, however, that the idea, recommended by a large number of NGOs, that the focus should be shifted from an aid effectiveness agenda to a development effectiveness agenda, thus highlighting the urgent need for genuinely consistent development policies, has not been adopted. It is also important to point out that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) tried to weaken our proposal on the introduction of a tax on financial transactions as an alternative source of funding, but failed due to the Greens’ opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It underlines the importance of development ownership following a bottom-up approach, of non-fragmentation of aid and of setting up strong, effective and independent follow-up enforcement mechanisms, involving parliaments and civil society at both national and international level. Aid should serve as a lever for inclusive, sustainable growth because the allocation of aid takes into account the individual characteristics of each country, thus strengthening aid effectiveness in those countries whose need is greatest in order to reduce poverty and aid dependency, as well as foster job creation and self-sustainable growth in developing countries. I believe that development aid is not, in itself, enough to eradicate poverty and that it should address its causes, rather than its symptoms. There is a need for more effective aid as part of a development process which seeks to create, in recipient countries, strong, environmentally friendly economies in which access to basic social services is guaranteed for all citizens and, ultimately, to reduce dependence on aid in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Promises will have to be translated into tangible achievements. In Busan, the following needs to be done: 1. Remind donor countries of their commitment to devote seven per cent of their GNP to public development aid by 2015. 2. Make democratic ownership the guiding principle of aid and development effectiveness. Democratic ownership requires strong government institutions that are capable of guaranteeing participation and accountability, by paying particular attention to the involvement of parliamentarians, to local authorities, to civil society organisations (CSOs), to the existence of a free media and to the private sector. 3. Point out that budget support is the most appropriate instrument for achieving the objective of aid effectiveness. 4. Highlight the emergence of new stakeholders, emerging countries, foundations and so on. Besides Paris and Accra, there are other types of relations, other ways of doing things and taking action on which we must now draw. Faced with the fragmentation of aid, the complexity of the challenges that exist and the struggle to make progress in the aid effectiveness agenda, we must be less bureaucratic and dare to be politically inspired. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another study shows that more ambitious application of the principles of the Declaration could have saved the EU and its Member States billions. Against the background of the economic difficulties the EU and its Member States currently face, the real challenge lies not so much in reaching the quantitative target level of ODA, but in achieving the biggest impact with the money we spend. The procedures and practices to achieve this are there, the thing lacking is strong leadership and sustained political commitment to accelerate implementation. China, a signatory of the Paris Declaration as a recipient, has actively expanded its aid programme at a rate of around 30% per year for the past five years. Now is a good time to find ways to involve China in the aid architecture, as it seeks to enhance the impact of its policies and aid. Both donors and recipient countries have received a sobering signal, and the fourth High-level meeting in Busan is a forum to draw conclusions and look for a way forward to achieve MDGs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Development aid is crucial for receiving countries in terms of reducing poverty. However, development aid should not be seen as enough to combat it on its own – it will take more than simply doling out money to change this. It is important to address the root causes of poverty, and to promote job creation and international trade as means of combating poverty. Development aid has a role to play in the EU’s foreign policy. Collectively, the EU and its Member States contribute more than half of global overseas development aid. My own Member State, Ireland, gave EUR 675.8 million of development aid in 2010. As such, development aid is an important instrument which the EU can use to shape issues such as human rights, social inclusion, gender equality, citizenship and climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Eurobarometer survey conducted in September 2010 shows that Europeans strongly support assistance provided to developing countries (89% of respondents). As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I am strongly inclined to agree with this opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the improvement of grant management as proposed by the Commission may help to save money while increasing the effectiveness of existing aid. We have only four years left to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Time is running out, particularly given the economic crisis, during which countries are trying to manage their funds in a more economical way. We must remember, however, that the EU is the largest donor of development aid worldwide, and therefore we have an additional responsibility for its effective implementation. The fourth High-level forum on aid effectiveness is crucial to review the mechanism of providing assistance to third countries, so that at least the majority of the Millennium Goals can be achieved by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to improve the participation of third countries in the implementation of projects related to the MDGs. When preparing the development policy, particular attention should be given to the development of gender equality. Gender equality must be included in the action plan on aid effectiveness. It is a matter of priority because women are in a much worse economic situation than men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union shall take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries’. It is important to stress that the EU and its 27 Member States are the largest donors of official development assistance, so they have a vital role in strengthening the effectiveness of aid granted at international level. I am voting for this report, as I believe countries should step up cooperation at international level, harmonise their efforts and streamline their procedures. I also believe it is important to step up financial aid and involve the private sector in the aid to be given to the most disadvantaged countries, in order to build an economy that is not dependent on external aid, to ensure sustainable development, and to create wealth. Lastly, I believe that the fourth High-level forum on aid effectiveness should be able to develop a new international aid architecture in the run-up to the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
