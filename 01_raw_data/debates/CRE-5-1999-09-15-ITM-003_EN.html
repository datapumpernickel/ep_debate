I would ask you to pass these sentiments on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you for the honour I have today of speaking to you on the subject of the agenda and the preparatory work relating to the forthcoming Extraordinary European Council meeting. At the European Council meeting in Tampere, we wish to take the next big step towards a Union that will provide for the people who live within its borders an area of freedom, security and justice. This is a logical and inevitable step in the Union’s development. We have built a single market in which people, goods, services and capital may circulate freely. We are in the process of adopting a common currency, which will add to the benefit of us all. Next, we must guarantee each and every person living in the Union area the genuine right to freedom of movement and, at the same time, the right to security everywhere in the Union area. In this respect the Union must, in compliance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, eventually become one united area in which people and business players can enjoy to the full the rights that are theirs. At Tampere, we must agree future policy guidelines for co-operation, commit to certain jointly agreed concrete action, and ensure that restrictions imposed by the Pillars do not constitute a barrier to the effective action we wish to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Up till now, the greatest successes of the Union have been based on the adoption of the Community method. It last showed its strength in the creation of the single market. It may also be feasible to use it now. Legislation in Member States must be brought closer in a spirit of impartiality, and harmonised; we have to create common minimum provisions and apply the principle of mutual recognition. Above all, I believe that we can achieve a good deal of co-operation by removing the technical, administrative and legal barriers that prejudice it. In mentioning this latter area, my comment might sound lightweight, but in practice, it is just that barrier that we have to overcome. I myself sincerely believe that if we were to ask the citizens of the Member States what they wished to see, it would be that they expect the Union to become more effective and determined in their resolve to reinforce their rights and strengthen their security.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing internal security will require a more obviously standardised and consistent policy than exists at present, and that is also true of the Union’s external relations. The methods used in legal and home affairs policy as well as foreign and security policy, in the same way as with commercial and development co-operation policy, must be made more uniform so that our citizens may be assured of a secure environment in these respects also.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind everyone that the Union will be growing in the near future. We must keep it very clear in our minds that this geographical area we call the Union will be expanding over the following years. Co-operation in the area of internal affairs and legal matters must be developed with the applicant countries so that together we can achieve the goals we have set for Union policy. External relations have to be examined as a whole, with the neighbouring regions to the north, east and south having an equal share in the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I go into the details of the Tampere agenda, may I be so bold, although I am at a sitting of the European Parliament, as to remind everyone that, happily, we are not alone in Europe. For purposes of co-operation, we can also rely on the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which have meritorious traditions and can offer much expertise in this matter. I hope we can bear them too in mind in developing the co-operation I have referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my intention today to inform you of the agenda and preparatory work relating to the European Council meeting in Tampere. Before anything else, I would like to outline some of the main aims of the Presidency before the meeting takes place. At the same time, I hope your ideas will inspire me in further preparation for the meeting, since we still have that opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly then, the Tampere agenda: the European Council meeting in Tampere will focus on three main issues, namely immigration and asylum policy, tackling cross-border crime, and a European judicial area.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearer goals than those that existed earlier for justice and home affairs were created with the Treaty of Amsterdam. The decision-making procedures available to us and the legislative instruments to be used are now more effective and the Community institutions are in a stronger position. The position of the Presidency is that the new instruments now have to be made full use of. The European Council at Vienna last December furnished us with an excellent plan of action which sets out our work timetable for the near future. There is no need, then, to draft a new plan of action at Tampere. We are hoping that the Tampere meeting will produce policies and commitments, the necessity for which our citizens in the various countries can also understand.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall pay special attention throughout to human rights and transparency, which are an essential part of the foundations of an area of freedom, security and justice. I might point out that everyone living within the territory of the Union must enjoy human rights, without discrimination. Apart from that, I want to make the point that when we respect the rights of minorities, we not only respect their human rights and dignity but, at the same time, we also increase the stability of our society and, hence, the security of all our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to speak in rather more detail about immigration and asylum policy which, as I am aware, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice have already given an account of here. In my opinion, all who reside or who are hoping to reside in the Union area have a right to security. A key aim of the European Council meeting in Tampere should be an agreement to create for the Union a common policy on immigration and asylum. At Tampere, we should achieve consensus on the creation of a European asylum system based on common principles. And what, then, should it be based on? It should be mainly based on the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and Article 63 of the Treaty on European Union. The aim is to offer a high level of protection, common to all countries as far as is possible, to those who need it. Our goal must be a single European asylum area, which observes common minimum provisions and procedures. In this way, the system will be simpler, clearer and quicker, which is good as far as human beings are concerned. At the same time, obviously, we must the whole time ensure that this cannot lead to situations that compromise human rights. We must remember that the right to asylum is an individual right.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Kosovo showed that it is high time the Union agreed, inter alia, the divisions of responsibility and principles to follow in times of temporary protection. The Union must be ready to offer swift protection in mass evacuation situations. The offer of temporary protection relies on the will to be protected and the will and ability on the part of the recipient state to take responsibility. I believe that we shall achieve results in this respect at Tampere. For me, it seems natural that in mass evacuation situations, Community funds could be used and other Community joint financing measures could be taken to provide economic compensation. In this way, solidarity among the Member States would come about in a more natural way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the basis for allowing immigration and the prevention of illegal immigration must be standardised. The rights and obligations of foreigners legally resident in the Member States of the Union must be safeguarded in a more standardised way. For me it would be quite conceivable that the rights of someone who has immigrated into a country should be closer to those of the citizens of that country after that person has lived there legally for a certain period of time. It would certainly be most important for a migrant to find out, for example, about social services and his or her rights in respect of political activity. There is experience of this in certain countries that we can draw on.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to speak of the Union’s external border controls. As this also concerns the country holding the Presidency, we have obviously given consideration to this matter before. The Union’s external border controls must be developed so that it becomes better balanced and more standardised, in compliance with the Schengen measures. With the next phase of enlargement, the external borders of the Union will once again alter, and the importance of viable surveillance will grow both as far as the security of the public and freedom of movement are concerned. It is most important to focus on action to prevent illegal immigration without jeopardising any further the institution of asylum, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam provides new opportunities for planning a policy of repatriation. In my opinion, we must take full advantage of these new opportunities. At Tampere, we could come to an agreement that Community and other agreements should consistently contain clauses relating to repatriation. In certain cases, the Union should aim to initiate negotiations leading to multilateral agreements on repatriation. The Treaty of Amsterdam also calls for provisions to be drafted among the Member States of the Community on the subject of repatriation. The Union must also actively support those who are willing to return to their land of origin. In this connection, we must investigate the means available to us. I shall give just one example: the use of development aid could be one way of easing the repatriation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s immigration and asylum policy must form a properly integrated part of our current, more standardised foreign relations policy. We must turn our attention to the conditions prevailing in the most significant countries migrants and those seeking asylum are departing from, conditions that induce or even force them to leave their homeland. The Union could try to influence the situation by means of various arrangements for co-operation in the areas of foreign and security policy, development co-operation, economic co-operation and migration policy. The Union must also show greater capacity for responding to different crisis situations. A report by a top-level working party in the Council, which discussed this issue in full, will be distributed, with its various annexes according to country, to Parliament in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will turn to the issue of tackling cross-border crime. The creation of an area of security, where justice prevails, will only be possible if those who abuse its freedoms are brought to justice. We have to remove the technical, administrative and legislative barriers that hamper co-operation among the authorities. One real development, which I think could well be raised at Tampere, would be to come to an agreement making it possible to make use of international investigatory teams. The police authorities should be given powers to act in cross-border co-operation with the relevant national authorities to resolve any given case.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol is an important tool in this sort of co-operation. It must be given the resources it needs to commence operations, and, furthermore, the necessary political support. After that, more thorough consideration must be given to the expansion of its operation. At Tampere Europol’s field of operation should first be expanded to cover crime relating to money laundering. Secondly, the European Council could charge the Council with embarking on the drafting of legislation that would oblige Member States to respond to requests from Europol for investigation and assistance. The extension of powers for Europol I hope for must be reinforced by means of legal and political monitoring of the operation. These must be equally balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the time is ripe to identify the existence of those types of crime for which more harmonised criminal legislation among the Member States would result in more effective intervention on our part. I do not wish to appear too ambitious in these matters. I know that it would take any amount of hard work, but I shall list those matters that are of most importance. At the European Council meeting in Tampere, we could identify, for example, the following areas as taking priority: the trade in women and children, child pornography, money laundering, making counterfeit euro notes, and safeguarding new, cross-border technology. These are the recommendations of the country holding the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In fighting crime, we must strive for its prevention. We have to prevent opportunities for crime and we must make it harder and less tempting to commit crime. The aim is obviously to reduce in particular the risk of young people committing crime. In this way, we safeguard our future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must pay special attention to the status of the victims of crime and those suspected or accused of crime. I want to emphasise that it is necessary to work in each of these areas. At Tampere, we should be able to reach a decision on the drafting of a programme of co-operation at Union level to help the victims of crime. The rights of victims should be protected in such a way as to guarantee them equal status irrespective of Member State, nationality or language. At Tampere, our Heads of State and Government could also ask the Commission for a proposal on a system which would guarantee, inter alia,<span class="italic"> </span>adequate interpretation facilities and legal aid for those suspected or accused of crimes in different Member States. I hope that you will not think I am taking up too much time on these issues; I admit I am a former Minister for Justice, although here and now I appear in my capacity as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I wish to speak of a European judicial area. When we discuss the development of co-operation relating to matters of law and internal matters, the main emphasis is perhaps too readily placed on action in connection with security. However, it is at least as important to consider how we may improve the situation with respect to human rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the single market and the adoption of the euro have increased dealings among people in many ways. The consequences of this new internationalism are plainly visible. There are more and more marriages between people of different countries and, similarly, people work and study abroad, buy and sell goods and services abroad, and invest or borrow money in countries other than their own. This has become a part of normal everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to the different legal, administrative and technical barriers that exist, it is, however, still unduly difficult to make full use of one’s rights. We know that the barriers are in certain respects very much due to the differences that exist in national legal systems. We also know that in this Union area there are northern, southern and common law systems of jurisdiction, so I do not by any means underestimate the difficulties. We are still a long way from being a single European area, although we speak of issues that directly concern the everyday existence of human beings. The creation of a European judicial area will be, however, one of the most important challenges for the Union in the next few years. Our citizens must be able to put their trust in the workability of legal and administrative systems and the adequacy of legal protection, irrespective of whereabouts in the Union they are travelling or are resident. The aim must be to safeguard the fair treatment of our citizens, promote the establishment at national level of less complex institutions for resolving disputes, and ensure basic legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, people must, without undue difficulty, be able to discover what factors mainly affect their legal status. They must also have adequate scope for making their rights a practical reality. This is a matter for both the legal and the administrative authorities. Procedures must not be too slow, complicated or expensive. People should be able to take full advantage of existing information technology. Heads of State and Government could give their support to a scheme whereby the Union starts to discover how access to legal aid in the various Member States might be made easier and could promote the establishment at national level of less complex institutions for resolving disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Member States should adopt a constructive stance in recognising decisions and judgements made by the authorities in other Member States. All of us involved in politics know very well how difficult this sometimes is, and the sort of publicity it leads to. We must be able to recognise court judgements and decisions made by the authorities throughout the Union area. This would save people from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive costs, and would show that we have confidence in the legal systems of others. I would like to remind you all that we have already made significant progress in certain areas (for example, the amendments to the Treaty of Brussels and the Lugano Convention). Government leaders at Tampere could thus commit to a situation that is now making consistent progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we fear the harmonisation of civil and criminal law, or at least investigating the possibility of it. The Treaty of Amsterdam opens up new opportunities in this area for both procedural and substantive law. We could have common minimum provisions for certain matters concerning, for example, the admissibility of evidence, legal aid and other aspects of court procedure in cases that transcend borders. Then, dare I say it, we could also investigate in what areas of the law of property, contract law and even family law we could make progress in. This would increase legal security. I know that the law is only an extension of culture. There are obviously enormous cultural differences within the area, but nothing should prevent us from exploring possibilities for making people’s everyday existence easier.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken very clearly in favour of closer co-operation and the harmonisation of legislation. I would like to state just as emphatically that this must not lead to a situation in which we would be bartering away the hallmarks of our various cultures. On the contrary, as I said, a legal system is part of a culture; it reflects each country’s own particular culture. In a certain way, we must appreciate and respect that. Nevertheless, I would also like to remind everyone that we have agreed certain common principles, which we can bring to all our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At Tampere, we shall also decide upon the implementation of the decisions taken on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The discussion of the contents of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will, however, take place elsewhere, that is to say by the preparatory body established in respect of the Charter, and in which the European Parliament too will have an important role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">An immediate project to reinforce human rights also constitutes an enforcement of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union. That Article obliges the Community to commence action to counter discrimination. I shall expect initiatives from the Commission regarding the implementation of this aim, which should be achieved as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Schröder and the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, sent a jointly signed letter to their colleagues in March, since which time we have been collecting ideas from Member States drafted in their capital cities on the meeting’s agenda, its aims and its main areas of focus. The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs whom you have heard speak here, begin their talks on the same subject tomorrow in Turku.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall make a final decision on the Tampere agenda only when the viewpoints of other bodies have also been heard, which the Prime Minister will hear when he makes his tour of capitals at the end of the month. In preparatory work for the meeting, we are also making use of, inter alia,<span class="italic"> </span>the results of the work of a top-level working party on asylum and immigration and the viewpoints of the European Parliament. We are also working in co-operation with the UN. The UNHCR and numerous NGOs have made an important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that you would like to know what my view is of the participation on the part of the European Parliament. The European Parliament has now had a significant impact on the outcome of the Tampere agenda. The Finnish Minister for Justice and Minister for Home Affairs attended the Inter-Parliamentary Conference organised for 24 and 25 March this year by the European Parliament on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. They also debated the issue with the Committee on Parliamentary Affairs at the beginning of September. I can assure you now that our discussions today will play an important part too. I shall convey your views to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs who can then take account of them in their own talks. The meeting at Tampere we shall organise ourselves in compliance with the conventions established for European Councils. The meeting will start with a speech by the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Many NGOs and the media have long held the view that, whenever we speak of matters of law or internal affairs, we in the Union remain rather secretive. We now have to rid ourselves of this image. We are taking decisions that will directly impact on the lives of our citizens. Then it is a matter of democracy that decisions are taken openly and even if their subject matter is fiercely debated, everyone should be aware of it. I am quite ready to discuss this issue here. I promise to listen closely to you and reply to your questions to the best of my ability. I believe that we shall reach consensus on most issues. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marín,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Heads of State and Government took the initiative almost a year ago to call an Extraordinary European Council meeting which would be principally dedicated to the area of freedom, security and justice. This is therefore an act of great importance which will guide the activities of the Union during the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is important that the European Parliament, whose activity during this last year has been considerable, ensures that its voice is heard after the resolution adopted in its April plenary part-session which established the political framework which is now required.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on what we are debating today, furthermore, will have the advantage that it will be adopted on time so that it will be known in the informal meeting in Turku which begins tomorrow. And the fact that you are talking at the same time about the area of freedom, security and justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights illustrates the unavoidable political relationship between the two objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of freedom, security and justice must be backed up by a solid guarantee of the respect for rights corresponding to the realities of contemporary society, which is in line with the open and innovative approach which this Parliament wishes to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, totally shares this approach, and will firmly commit itself to the process of drawing up the Charter and, of course, Mrs Halonen, we will communicate to the next Commission your invitation to the Commission to make specific proposals in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has given some indications as to the most radical institutional reforms which will have to be taken account of during the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, neither must we forget, although there is much that must be changed, the possibilities which the new framework of the Treaty of Amsterdam offers, particularly in relation to democratic control and transparency. The Commission fully shares your opinion on the contents you wish to see for the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Some common ground has come into view; for example, with regard to the importance attached to access to justice, the development of a coherent strategy in the field of immigration and asylum, the protection of the weaker groups and those suffering from discrimination, or the strengthening of the mechanisms used in the fight against organised crime. These are very sensitive points and they will all firstly require a broad political consensus and a great political will in order to find common solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is a basic objective in bringing the Union closer to the citizens, and this matter forms part of the daily concerns of the citizens of the Union. It is therefore essential if European construction is to have even more legitimacy. For this reason, failure is not an option.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the Commission, like Parliament, hopes and trusts that the Tampere meeting will provide an initial impetus. The issues are very complicated, very sensitive and, as Mrs Halonen said, very different political cultures will be dealing with the same phenomenon, but it is good that this process has been started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that this summit in Tampere is an Extraordinary Summit on the subject of making preparations for an area of freedom, security and justice. In conclusion you also pointed out that prior to this – tomorrow and the day after – an Extraordinary Council Summit would take place, a meeting of Ministers for Justice and Ministers for Home Affairs in Turku. That is why it is so important for us to discuss this subject today here in Parliament, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of this preparation meeting tomorrow and the day after in Turku and against the background of having to deal in Europe, unfortunately, with a rise in organised crime, drugs-related crime, the criminal trade in human beings and the like, it was incomprehensible to me that we should have to discuss in this Chamber whether we could even have this debate here in the European Parliament. I am pleased, however, that we in the European People’s Party, together with the friends of security, have successfully been able to implement the initiative in this Chamber against the Social Democrat Group who did not want this discussion to take place here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of the possibility and the necessity of giving a clear sign here that we take the sphere of security and justice seriously, that the point is to prepare material for the Tampere Summit in the interests of the security and freedom of the citizens of Europe. This is essential. The Council keeps appearing here and putting forward great proposals. I see that as very positive. What is lacking is the translation of these into concrete action. What became, for example, of the asylum paper which was discussed about a year ago? What became of the strategic paper on asylum and migration submitted by the Austrian Presidency? We are still waiting for the implementation of EURODAC. We are waiting for the harmonisation of data which would make it possible to check which anti-drugs campaigns are successful and which are not. Announcements must be followed by action. This is what we are waiting for, concrete action in three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are waiting for comprehensive strategies on the management of migration which, on the one hand, do not make excessive demands on the capacity of Member States and their citizens to integrate but, on the other hand, also help to avoid social conflict. We are waiting for lasting instruments for joint solutions to deal with the influx of refugees, unified standards in the field of asylum procedures. For us, burden sharing in the reception of refugees is indispensable, as indispensable as the preparation of on-site aid. We need permanent solutions here. What we also need – I am pleased to see that you mentioned them – are instruments to fight against illegal immigration, the criminal trade in human beings and the abuse of asylum. We are therefore waiting for EURODAC to be quickly set up and the Schengen security system to become effective at all frontiers in Europe. We are also awaiting effective measures in the fight against organised crime. EUROPOL must be fully developed; it must be given operative authority. Cross-border collaboration between police forces must be extended to provide co-operation in training and co-operation with applicant countries. Naturally, we expect judicial co-operation to guarantee legal protection for citizens while, on the other hand, enabling speedy and effective criminal prosecution across borders, and that means accelerated procedures, the direct exchange of documents, harmonisation of criminal law systems and also assistance for the victims of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge has been issued to the Council. We expect deeds, not fine words and summit photos.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Social Democrats here in Parliament are very keen to participate already at this stage in the debate on these important issues. The removal of obstacles on the road to economic and cultural interaction lies at the heart of European co-operation. With the single market we wish to improve Europe’s capacity for responding to global competition and thereby create conditions to improve the welfare of our citizens. Free movement also carries with it the threat of a growth in international crime, which citizens in various parts of Europe feel today is one of the greatest causes for concern. On the other hand, increased co-operation among the Member States will compel us to examine citizens’ rights from a European viewpoint, one that is broader than that pertaining to the individual state. In this connection, we must emphasise the importance of non-discrimination and the realisation of the rights of minorities. I also wish to express my satisfaction regarding Mrs Halonen’s urgent call in her speech for the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Unity, and I too would like to see initiatives from the Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October will be a historic attempt to shape EU common policy in the prevention of cross-border crime, and in the creation of a European judicial area and a common policy on immigration and asylum. One of the main issues of the meeting is that of fundamental rights as recognised under the Treaty of Amsterdam, including the right of citizens to security. Effective crime prevention requires closer co-operation among Member States, which in practice means the co-ordination of legislation and better co-ordination with respect to co-operation with the police and the investigation of crime. It is also important to invest in the prevention of crime, which is naturally a matter of considerably broader scope than an issue merely for legislative policy. Safeguarding the free movement of our citizens and the flexible creation of legislation on the subject will require the adoption of the practice of majority ruling in Union legislation. In reality, it is a question of the implementation, among other things, of the Schengen Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">By strengthening the role of the Union in the creation of a European judicial area, and in the prevention of international crime, we can, at the same time, dispel suspicions that are known to exist regarding closer European co-operation. Our job will be to show that this is an integral part of European co-operation and, in this way, we will be responding to the worries expressed by our citizens. These matters also concern the period following enlargement; in other words, the demands being made on the applicant countries. Closer co-operation will also create a basis for unhampered interaction with the Union’s neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity, transparency and ethically sustainable action must be the guiding principle behind European decision-making, whether it is a matter of the Union’s internal administrative culture or of ensuring the rights and security of our citizens. We need the co-operation of various players, so that these principles may also reach the attention of the people. The NGOs have an important task to perform. The fact that Parliament is debating this important subject right now, well before the Extraordinary Summit at Tampere, indicates that the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam is being realised in the way intended. In compliance with the same principle, it is important to assure Parliament that it will be represented on an equal basis with the Council when the Union prepares to draft the Charter in respect of the fundamental rights of citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, the Council Presidency’s tour of capitals has identified three areas about which the President-in-Office has spoken this morning: asylum and immigration, the fight against cross-border crime and the establishment of a European judicial area. I would like to deal with each one briefly in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">The political challenge in asylum and immigration is striking a balance between the need to safeguard asylum as an individual right and to ensure the proper protection of refugees and the desire to resist economic migration. Europe needs a common policy on migration. At the very least we need minimum common standards. Those must be based on the 1951 Geneva Convention and on the UNHCR guidelines. We must avoid the lowest common denominator approach which would lead to a downward spiral in the level of protection. The European Union must show that it will not become a fortress, terrified of infection from without, but that it will remain a refuge for the dispossessed.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in recent years show us how easily situations of mass influx of refugees can come about. We need a clear message from Tampere on disentangling asylum from the debate on migration. A temporary protection regime is fine but only in exceptional circumstances and must not be one which denies the right to individual examination of asylum claims. Let us make sure that we are not moving back to asylum at political discretion but that we still regard asylum as a human right.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against cross-border crime it is clear that Europol has a role. Let us get it going. But it is only part of the solution. There are other ways to strengthen police cooperation such as the idea of a European police staff college. And there are ways to strengthen judicial cooperation. For example, some of the ideas that have been put forward under the title “Eurojust”, bringing prosecutors and magistrates from different countries together to prosecute cross-border crime. We need to determine the precise role, powers and financial implications of Eurojust and the issue of accountability. We need to maintain a balance between the prosecution of offences and the protection of the rights of defendants.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about making life more difficult for the criminal but harmonising offences and penalties is an ambitious project. It has been compared to the 1992 Single Market Programme. It merits study, but let us not make the best the enemy of the good. Let us also look at progress on mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would challenge you, President-in-Office, to define the European judicial area. It seems in matters of civil law to be about making access to justice easier. There are opportunities for concrete progress in cross-border litigation. We have already a certain degree of harmonisation: certain conventions are being worked on, for example, on driving disqualification. Much can be done on mutual recognition too. But when the European judicial area is looked at in the criminal field we are perhaps talking about operating as though there were no legal boundaries within Europe. When we deal with harmonisation of criminal law the key concept is full confidence in each other’s legal systems. Here we need common minimum standards and safeguards, for example, on the treatment of suspects in custody. We need a rigorous and transparent evaluation of criminal justice systems in the Member States. We need a form of inspection and evaluation to build confidence, perhaps similar to the Schengen test on border controls. We need to invest in judicial systems such as in the training of judges and magistrates. I would commend to the Presidency the proposal for a system of Euro bail where people could be granted bail while they await trial and serve the period of bail in their home state.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, President-in-Office, the scale of the agenda you have for Tampere is wide, the contributions from the Member States are many and varied. Your ideas seem not yet completely formed so you will forgive us if we are sceptical about the prospects for success. We need the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers there if we are to have real progress. We need the European Parliament involved. That means giving us full access to documentation as the debate develops. Finally, we need from Tampere a summit that will carry public opinion, that will tailor its ambitions to the human and financial resources available but will give us guidelines to demonstrate the relevance of the area of freedom, security and justice to ordinary people</p>

A certain Finnish television reporter, who had used a quite harmless memo on the Tampere meeting he had got from a Member of Parliament, received a communication from the Secretary-General and the Speaker at the Finnish Parliament banning him indefinitely from entering the Parliament building. Suppressing the free flow of information and bypassing society in this way, whilst preparing for a summit on an area of freedom, security and justice, gives cause to suspect that that area is not free or open to the extent that our traditions would require. It gives cause to suspect that narrow, strict security, which is ultimately based on repression, will ignore those very freedoms and fundamental rights of citizens whose enhancement ought now to be on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish writer, Samuli Paronen, said, “The more efficient the security systems, the more insecure the people”. Ignorance is not a virtue; sometimes it may be a questionable blessing. Ignorance due to secrecy has no place in a mature political system, such as the one we should be building for a Europe of the citizen, of the individual. In this way, we can also achieve a positive, humane and open policy on immigration and an asylum procedure which genuinely complies with the Geneva Convention and avoids discrimination of any kind.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Democracy also demands that people have fundamental rights, which may not be violated by means of majority ruling. Such violations must be prevented in a constitutionally governed state. Privacy is a human right that cannot be abolished with an EU directive, a convention or national legislation. There is legal provision for the protection of privacy in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Representing the Council, Mrs Halonen said that it was necessary to identify certain new types of crime that had come into existence. But then it is necessary to recognise the existence also of crimes relating to the violation of people’s privacy, which intelligence agencies in the USA and the EU countries are guilty of 24 hours a day. I speak of electronic surveillance. In the European judicial area, prevention of this type of crime seems still not to be the object of political and parliamentary preparatory action or control, and merely takes the form of police co-operation. There are types of crime that remain outside the democratic system, which the preparation of the Enfopol 19 document is connected with. There are undemocratic issues that are connected with the so-called Ilets police co-operation. Undemocratic too is the Echelon programme for collaboration on espionage and the bilateral agreements between the security services in the USA and the EU countries. It is also a crime that American computer manufacturers and software companies install special ID codes in their products. It is a crime against people’s privacy, in addition to which it jeopardises the security of European states.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to fight against such things and crimes of this type with transparency and by drawing public attention to them. I hope that Finland will move from words to deeds in this issue. At present, there is no visible prospect of an increase in transparency and public awareness during the Finnish presidential term: they only speak about it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main reason for this is that the resolution aims at introducing a legal situation which goes beyond the EU treaties in force. The resolution includes a number of proposals which are directly inconsistent with each other. It will not be possible to stop organised crime, the trade in human beings, money laundering and terrorism just through co-operation between police forces if, at the same time, the doors to the free movement of people between EU countries are opened, both for EU citizens and everyone else, and certainly not if controls on the EU’s external borders are weakened, as will inevitably happen when the EU is enlarged. As a prior condition of creating peace and security in Europe, the EU’s Member States must work more actively to create this peace, security, economic growth and democracy in the EU’s poor neighbouring countries. The solution is not to use resources in a non-prioritised way to move poor countries’ populations to Europe, but to employ resources for the purpose of exporting European development to poor countries. Immigration to Europe helps only a minority and often a quite random minority, while the majority of people in the immigrants’ home countries continues to suffer under existing conditions. The motion for a resolution is devoid of any reference to these central solutions, and it is aimed solely at promoting federalist development in the European Union, a form of development which a majority of the population in my country, Denmark, dissociated itself from in the 1993 referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The institutions have high expectations in terms of what the further development of the European Union will bring its citizens. I think there is a need for a certain amount of modesty when it comes to the things we can achieve, and that we should exercise a certain amount of caution when it comes to extending European competencies in the field of justice and home affairs still further.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly a need for this. A European policy on asylum is long overdue, for example. Opening up the borders has created a need for co-ordination. A number of countries, of which the Netherlands is one, have had to deal with a disproportionately large influx of asylum seekers in recent years. The reality of the situation is compelling us to bring about substantive harmonisation of legislation in order to prevent a “race to the bottom”. The main thing is that genuine asylum seekers should not suffer as a result of the tightening-up of EU legislation. The minimum standards must not be allowed to become quite that minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not consider it to be a good idea to draw up a European Charter, a new catalogue of civil rights. The constitutions of the Member States, the ECHR and other treaties already offer adequate protection to citizens, so there is no need for there to be an accumulation of all different kinds of constitutional systems of government, as the Dutch Minister for Home Affairs said last week.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, there are many items on the Tampere agenda offering us the opportunity to get down to some real work. However, the European Parliament runs the risk of putting itself beyond the discussion by straining to achieve its own utopia in which the citizens are enabled, by virtue of the advantages of European citizenship thrust upon them, to at last see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is just another decoy being waved in front of public opinion in Europe in order to deceive people into thinking that Europe is capable of solving their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak, anticipating a little bit, about the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference; this conference is actually already on course without us however knowing the exact conditions. The European elections demonstrated the very deep disaffection of the various peoples of Europe with regard to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions which public opinion has been wondering about may be summed up as follows: where exactly does Europe offer added value and improve these decision-making systems of ours? Has Europe brought us greater economic growth, an improved standard of living in daily life or the expectation of participating in a great adventure? The response given in many countries, starting with the Netherlands – which in fact surprised me a little, because it was in the Netherlands that the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam were signed – has been negative. More and more people are starting to have doubts about the value of the fast track to integration and indeed about the value of the Treaties which Mr Barnier, who has moved all the way from Gaullism to centrism finding no middle ground, would like to see enshrined in the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">But, Mr Bourlanges, thirty years ago you were a Gaullist and now you are the opposite of a Gaullist, since you are a centrist.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the subject of the forthcoming IGC should be not to reinforce this institutional process but, on the contrary, to reduce it, that is to say, to limit the scope of activities of the Union, returning to a common market which respects the environment and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Mr Lamy, the Commissioner-delegate, described the building of Europe as a phenomenon without historical determinism, “a human and fragile endeavour.” He doubted that there was really a future…</p>

<p class="contents">The Extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere is undoubtedly particularly significant, since it aims to formulate more integrated policies on freedom, security and justice within the European Union as it is now, a European Union which is expanding and within a European Union which is developing ever closer ties with third countries – policies which, as we all understand, are perhaps more directly related to some of the issues which fall under the headings of justice, security and freedom in Europe, such as the issues of immigration and asylum. The Tampere meeting is also being called upon to address the issues of freedom, security and justice for citizens in relation to the new conditions created by the new challenges involved in crossing the threshold from the 20th to the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in a few hours, you will have in front of you a resolution of the European Parliament on these issues. I wish to ask you to pay particular attention to this resolution, since the proposals of the European Parliament do not aim just to resolve isolated problems. On the contrary, they aim to create a new institutional framework which will not only guarantee freedom, security and justice within the European Union, but also put forward recommendations for specific policies on a range of sensitive issues, such as the key issues of immigration, asylum – since, judging by recent events, it is clear that unfortunately we need a new approach to the matter – and crime. I believe, as I am sure we all do, that the list is a long one.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the drawing up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for citizens is, of course, also relevant to those issues to be discussed at the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere. At this stage, we are, of course, debating the establishment of a body that will deal with this very important matter. I would like to ask the Council to review its proposal and to ensure that the European Parliament’s participation in this body is genuinely representative of the European Parliament and reflects all the political forces and all the various political tendencies and beliefs which are currently to be found in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, unfortunately, he has left the Chamber after his speech, which has actually done more to raise the tone of the debate than his presence did.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish President-in-Office of the Council has presented her ideas, and I would like to draw your attention, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to one point which I consider essential in connection with the debate on the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice. Practically all the ideas you have presented, and everything my fellow Members have mentioned here in the debate – as far as the collaboration of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the Council and the Commission is concerned – is within a legal arena, which involves a great danger, the danger of alienating the legislature of the citizens, male and female, of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this construction of the area of freedom, security and justice about? It is about security and fundamental rights, that is, on the one hand, the immediate rights of the individual and the protection of security and, on the other hand, the protection of these individual rights by state bodies or by state bodies as they should be established in Europe. These are two factors, which can affect every individual citizen of Europe, male or female, directly. There is thus a direct involvement in almost all subjects, whether it is asylum, immigration, migration, EUROPOL, whether it is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or anything else, there is a direct involvement of each individual citizen, male or female, in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">But how will legislation be implemented? All the fine words of the Council do not alter the fact that in 90% of all acts which are passed, only the Council is actively involved. And how is it involved? Well, 15 executives come to Brussels, perform the function of a legislature in Brussels, and finally travel back home to their capital cities and then implement the laws enacted by the Council alone, which is to say, the executives in this way, as the practise has been until now, increasingly exclude the national parliaments – as can be seen so clearly in the case of EUROPOL and the materialisation of the EUROPOL Convention – and do not transfer the legislative function to the European Parliament. In this absence of referral to Parliament, the area of freedom, security and justice, which specifically represents the establishment of a structure of individual claims for protection and of possibilities of intervention in the individual sphere, cannot be established in a way that is really democratically justified. The European Parliament must therefore appeal to the Council and the Commission. Particularly in the areas which you have already – all too timidly, in my opinion – decided to make the European Parliament a legislative body with equal rights in the foreseeable future, if you wish to establish a democratic area of freedom, security and justice, in Tampere you must ensure that for the next Intergovernmental Conference we will be a legislative body with equal rights, otherwise you run the risk of alienating the European Union further from the citizens in general.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
