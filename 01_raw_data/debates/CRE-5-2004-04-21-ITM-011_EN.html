<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am reminded of an occasion when a senior politician in Ireland was described in very uncomplimentary terms because he was up and down so frequently making contributions. I will not go any further into the quotation, but will be available for private consultation on it later on!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the House for this opportunity to address the situation in Pakistan. I know that this is an issue on which there are divided and diverse views. The Council considers it vitally important that the European Union should continue to strengthen its relationship with Pakistan. That view is shared by Pakistan itself.</p>
<p class="contents">An enhanced relationship between the European Union and Pakistan is not just important on a bilateral basis. It is also important given the context of Pakistan's regional role in South Asia. I am therefore pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs – and I see Mr Brok is here to present its views – last week approved the conclusion of the third generation agreement with Pakistan, and that in consequence a resolution to that effect is before Parliament and will be voted on later.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is aware that the Council is of the view that the agreement is an important element in building an enhanced relationship with Pakistan. In such a relationship Pakistan can demonstrate its commitment to the respect, protection and promotion of human rights and to democratic principles, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contained in Article 1 of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that serious concerns remain in relation to human rights and democratic principles in Pakistan. Indeed, these concerns have been outlined in the resolution and recognised in the work of the committee. I can well understand that the committee needed time to weigh up carefully the pros and cons of the issue and would like to extend my appreciation to the committee members and in particular to its chairman, Mr Brok, and to the rapporteur, Mr Cushnahan, for the work they have done in this area. I can assure Parliament that the Council is well aware of the concerns that have been aired in the committee and takes those concerns very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of February this year Ireland's Foreign Minister, Mr Brian Cowen, as President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, conveyed those concerns to President Musharraf and to the Pakistani Foreign Minister when the EU ministerial troika visited Islamabad. The well-documented revelations regarding Dr Khan and the proliferation of nuclear technology were also addressed. The EU ministerial troika expressed its grave concern at these revelations. For its part the Pakistani side assured the European Union that the revelations will continue to be fully investigated. The presidency hopes this investigation will be thorough and credible. The European Union will continue to monitor this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other political issues which give rise to serious concern. The situation within the parliament, where the committee system has yet to be fully established, is far from ideal. Furthermore, on 13 April Mr Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, was sentenced to a total of 23 years imprisonment for what Pakistani authorities called 'inciting the army to mutiny'. The European Union has raised and will continue to raise with the Pakistani authorities its concern at these issues and the implications they could have for future EU-Pakistan relations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the position of religious minorities and journalists, who have been subject to restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary arrest and worse. We are concerned at all these issues. Nevertheless, on the positive side of the balance sheet, the third generation agreement would strengthen the platform from which the European Union can convey to the Pakistani authorities at the highest level the importance it attaches to relations with Pakistan and, as part of those relations, our concerns on human rights, democratisation, non-proliferation and other vital issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also mention that the conclusion of the third generation agreement clears the way for immediate conclusion of the technical negotiations already under way between the Commission and Pakistan on the readmission agreement. It is important to note that there have been a number of other positive developments. During the ministerial troika visit to Islamabad the EU welcomed the very important agreement that had just been reached by Pakistan and India on modalities for a composite dialogue between the two neighbours, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. It is in the interests of the region, the European Union and the wider international community that such positive developments be supported and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">President Musharraf's commitment to the fight against terrorism is also to be welcomed. It highlights Pakistan's crucial regional role, which has a bearing on the situation in Afghanistan and its nascent democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, again on a positive note, that significant progress has been made on the issue of the <span class="italic">Tasman Spirit</span> since our last meeting. Following the very positive moves by the Pakistani authorities in response to repeated European representations, all eight people have been released and have now returned to their homes. I am certain that honourable Members will welcome this development, as the presidency does. I am also certain that they will take some satisfaction in it because the vigilance and attention this Parliament has shown on this issue has been helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, while there remain points of concern as regards Pakistan, the Council considers that the European Union must engage with Pakistan on those points rather than isolate it. The Council will continue to work towards a resolution of these remaining concerns – which are shared by Parliament – in the interests of Pakistan, the region and the Union and, most importantly of all, in the interests of peace in the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I welcome the vote by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy at its meeting of 14 April, to recommend approval of the third-generation cooperation agreement with Pakistan. I am fully aware that this was passed by a pretty slim majority and that for many committee members this was not a decision that was taken lightly. I very much respect the principled stand taken by the rapporteur during the deliberations that have taken place in the European Parliament. I have come to value my honourable friend as a friend of democracy and a friend of human rights in Asia and he has done outstanding work as the European Union's Chief Election Observer in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I sympathise with many of the rapporteur’s views, I was not able to support him in his recommendation to keep the agreement pending. This is because <span class="italic">on balance</span> I feel we should regard this agreement as an opportunity to engage positively with Pakistan as an important partner in a sensitive region. I therefore hope that plenary, when it votes, will be able to endorse the Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation that the agreement be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I could recapitulate why the European Commission continues to support the entry into force of this third-generation cooperation agreement. First and foremost, by means of Article 1, it offers an opportunity to engage more substantially with Pakistan on critical issues of human rights and democracy. Secondly, the agreement gives us a better basis for addressing challenges in several key areas, including basic education, trade and institutional links. Last but not least, the agreement opens up the possibility of engaging Pakistan in new areas not previously covered, such as regional cooperation, money laundering and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard recent developments as strengthening our position in favour of entering into this agreement, in particular the encouraging efforts for reconciliation with India, as well as domestic political developments in Pakistan. As a result of these initiatives there has been a noticeable thaw in Pakistan's international relations. For example, there are now indications that Pakistan may be readmitted as a full member of the Commonwealth in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see that the seamen of the <span class="italic">Tasman Spirit</span>, including the master, have now been released and have returned to Greece and the Philippines. I know that many Members of the House have taken a strong personal interest in this matter. I myself raised it repeatedly with Minister Kasuri when last I met him in Berlin on 31 March; but I have raised the issue on a number of other occasions as well. The release of the men is indeed a very welcome development. We can finally draw a line under this most unfortunate incident and leave remaining issues to be sorted out by the claimants and insurers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would be the last to say that democracy in Pakistan is in perfect condition. The discussions on this agreement have very usefully highlighted the many areas of concern in our relations – concerns that are well reflected in the motion for a resolution currently before Parliament on the situation concerning human rights and democracy in Pakistan. In this regard, the Commission would welcome any further guidance Parliament may want to offer, in particular in the crucial areas of democratisation and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obviously aware of reports that General Musharraf may still be in two minds as to whether to shed his army uniform by the end of the year. In this connection, it is helpful that the Minister of Information has confirmed on the President's behalf that he would stand by his prior commitment. Any other outcome would hardly bolster confidence in the constitutional process in Pakistan. Pakistan needs to overcome the perception that real power lies with the President rather than the elected parliament and the civilian government. I have, however, during my personal visits to Pakistan, always been encouraged by the resilience of civil society in that country, and I remain convinced that this is a strength which the country will be able to build on in the future. I would like to associate myself with what the Minister Roche said about the recent conviction of Javed Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy. I can assure Parliament that we will continue to monitor his case very closely and pursue it strongly in our dialogue with the Pakistani Government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the overall human rights situation in Pakistan, there have been some positive developments, such as the adoption of a juvenile justice system order, but several serious concerns remain, including the blasphemy law, violence against women, the application of the death penalty and the incidence of child labour. Pakistan is a focus country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and the Commission is actively trying to address some of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This summary shows that the problems and challenges in Pakistan are manifold, but there are also advances and positive developments. It is the assessment of this balance that allows me to continue to believe that closer dialogue and cooperation within the structured format offered by the third-generation agreement will best enhance the European Union's capacity to help Pakistan deal with sensitive issues, including human rights, non-proliferation and counter-terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, then, I recognise the strength of views of some colleagues who would like to keep this agreement on ice. I think myself that, on balance, we should move ahead with the agreement, and I hope that in doing so we will be able to continue to take an active interest in the development of human rights and democracy in a country which is important to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in fact my belief that what Mr Cushnahan has been telling the House for months, and what is expressed in his resolution, does amount to apposite points of criticism that must be addressed in dialogue with Pakistan. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not present evidence of fully-fledged democracy, the rule of law, observance of human rights or of the rights of women in the sense in which one would expect on the basis of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, which is, after all, universal.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is certainly right and necessary that this third-generation cooperation agreement should also be used in such a way that the Council, the Commission and Parliament can work together in monitoring its further progress. Another possible model is that the Commission should regularly report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and to Parliament on progress in these fundamental issues of human coexistence, which is the proper way of moving the process along, a process also announced by the President of Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have to concede that progress may have been unsatisfactory, but there has been some. In particular, though, it has to be clear to us that, in what is one of the greatest conflicts Western civilisation has seen, Pakistan is very definitely on the side of those who are fighting terrorism, and that, if there is to be cooperation rather than confrontation, Pakistan’s position in a conflict affecting Iraq and Afghanistan is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that, in this Union of ours, mistakes have often been made, and misguided positions have been taken up. We know that both the United States and Pakistan have taken up positions on the Taliban that we would today regard as ill-advised, but, even so, we have to realise that it would have been impossible to make progress, in the aftermath of 11 September, without the help of neighbours such as Afghanistan and other countries, of which Pakistan is one. That is why I see ratification as necessary; we have to open up the way for the Council to take a decision and for the Commission to make use of its instruments accordingly, always, though, taking the positions expressed in the Cushnahan resolution as our starting point, so that there may be real development and progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of his speech, Commissioner Patten said that he was, on balance, in favour of recommending this agreement.

The EU has not always exploited such possibilities to the full, and Parliament should push harder in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights is well aware of the imperfect state of democracy and human rights in Pakistan. We are outraged at the discrimination and violence against women, at the continuation of the death penalty and at the persecution of minorities, especially religious and national ones. The role of the army is unacceptable and the intelligence services are far too powerful. However, this situation is more likely to improve if we are engaged in the dialogue that the agreement will create, and which will enable us to encourage the forces of progress and modernisation.</p>

This betrayal is taking place for a combination of unjustified geopolitical reasons and the 'thirty pieces of silver' in trading benefits that some Member States value so much.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened today to Minister Roche, Commissioner Patten and Baroness Ludford, who argued that there will be an enhanced human rights dialogue. Ask those who are persecuted and incarcerated in China, North Korea and Uzbekistan, where there is already a supposedly enhanced human rights dialogue whether it has helped them. Let me remind you that, in the case of Uzbekistan, this Parliament was pressurised into ratifying a similar agreement in 1999 and, since then, the human rights situation has deteriorated further.</p>
<p class="contents">The real reason why we are being asked to approve the accord is because of pressure from the US and the UK as a consequence of the current mess in Iraq resulting from a war that should never have been fought without UN approval. Does anyone think that it will help the situation in Iraq by abandoning the democratic and human rights of the people of Pakistan? Instead we will be feeding the arrogance of the President of a unipolar power and a subservient UK prime minister and supporting their mistake, which is currently being repeated in the Middle East with likely disastrous consequences!</p>
<p class="contents">I must ask my colleagues in the European Parliament, are we to be the puppets of the Council and the Commission or will we be the democratic voice of the people of Europe, defending freedom and human rights and giving hope to the oppressed people of the world?

I, too, am very sympathetic towards them, but I do think that we, who perhaps represent another outlook, are not led or guided either by the Council or by the Commission, by the USA or the United Kingdom. Seldom indeed do we find them all taking the same line.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed what the Commissioner and the President-in-Office have said it is; not a choice between black and white, but rather between differing shades of grey. The fact is that Pakistan is – as it ought to be – an important partner in the development of the region as a whole. As I see it, there has, over the past few months, been some progress in Pakistan’s attitude to Afghanistan and to the Taliban situation, as well as in relation to Kashmir, democracy and human rights. I am happy, though, to agree with Mr Cushnahan and all those who say that this is far from enough, and that much more has to be done to get Pakistan out of its isolation and moving towards more democracy and human rights. I also agree with all those who say that an agreement of this kind must serve as a basis for more intensive dialogue with Pakistan – and with countries like it – in order to spur them on to make further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Mr Cushnahan that I understand not in the least why it is that, having had most recently discussions even with Israel on this, we should not perhaps, here and there, insist on withdrawing from similar agreements if the undertakings given are not met. I am therefore entirely of the opinion that, having considered all the pros and cons – and I agree with you that there are a lot of the latter – there is, I think, an argument in favour of recommending this agreement by way of the resolution that Mr Brok has described so very well and that you too have signed. I would be the first to speak up on behalf of my group and demand our withdrawal from this agreement if the progress that has been begun were not to be continued and completed.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to believe that the arguments put forward in this debate do indeed hold water, and my group will recommend acceptance of the agreement. I do, however, respect all those who take a different line and whose consciences lead them to vote another way, for the human rights situation is as unsatisfactory as ever and in need of radical improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, a balance has been struck, as Mr Brok said. Positive things too are happening in Pakistan, especially the peace talks with India, which are incredibly important and which should have our total support. Is it not a little odd that, whenever we strike balances like this, the commercial, trade-policy aspects almost always end up counting for more than the very clear human rights principles we have written into our agreements? What are we playing at, having human rights clauses in agreements with other countries if we always strike balances that end up with our not bothering about the human rights clauses but allowing other, mainly economic, interests to count for more?</p>
<p class="contents">This leads to our undermining respect for our own high principles. It is that balance that makes us in the Greens/ALE Group think it obvious that we must say no to this agreement now. We hope that Pakistan will understand this signal and take measures that mean we can quite soon say yes instead of no. I should like to have said yes, but that is unfortunately impossible if we are to hold to our human rights principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had the opportunity during that delegation meeting to meet with President Musharraf, and I was much impressed by his commitment to pursuing a programme of peace and reconciliation with India. It looks, for the first time, as though both sides are prepared to think the previously unthinkable and find a resolution, driven by the economic impact on their two economies of a continuing conflict; a conflict that has dogged the world for the last 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are still enormous problems in Pakistan regarding human rights, democracy and nuclear proliferation. Colleagues have told us about the treatment of Christian and Ahmadi religious minorities, the situation of women, the deeply flawed election result that Mr Cushnahan oversaw, and the jailing of members of the opposition like Javed Hashmi. I would therefore concur with my colleagues on those concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year Mr Tannock and I added to our resolution on North Korea the fact that Pakistan had supplied blueprints for a highly enriched uranium technology programme to North Korea for the production of nuclear weapons. At the time, we were roundly attacked by the Pakistani Government and when I raised the issue with Foreign Minister Kasuri during the December meeting I was told that the North Koreans needed no help – they were well advanced with nuclear weapon technology, including miniaturisation. Whether or not they needed help, it is now clear that it was provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Now new questions are arising about the nuclear test of 30 May 1998 in Baluchistan, which looks as if it could have been a joint test of a plutonium weapon between Pakistan and North Korea. When I raised the issue with the Pakistani Ambassador, who came to see me this week, he said that they were cooperating with the United States. That is not good enough: we in the European Union want cooperation and to be kept in the loop as well. However, despite that, I will support this third-generation cooperation agreement. We will be paying close attention to further progress on human rights in Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Something quite different is at stake. It is what Commissioner Patten was talking about in relation to the Middle East this morning; it is about avoiding a clash of civilisations. It is about how, by working towards intercultural dialogue, we Europeans are performing what is a primary task for our own age and for our world. Whatever the reservations expressed in this debate, Pakistan very definitely has a positive role to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The question at issue is: who is our partner? North Korea is not one, but Pakistan is a partner in the fight against international terrorism, and the coalition ranged against that is of course much greater than the coalition of states at present in Iraq fighting terrorism there and fighting against the regime. The coalition combating international terrorism includes Germany, France, Russia and others. Pakistan is among them.

The main thrust of the agreement put to us is therefore political. We are all aware of Pakistan’s geostrategic role, bordering as it does on Afghanistan and India. We are all aware of the contribution it has made to the anti-terrorist coalition initiated by the Americans following the events of 11 September 2001. None of this, however, can justify our support for a country where the present authorities came to power by means of a military coup and where the most recent elections were held in circumstances condemned by our observers and resulted in the installation of a coalition of supporters of President Musharraf and Islamist fundamentalist religious parties not afraid to express their support for Bin Laden.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I reach a different conclusion that does not deny that the 17th Constitutional Amendment represents a return to democracy; that President Musharraf is supporting the bill on the Hudood Ordinances and action against so-called honour killings; that Mr Hashmi was tried in an independent court, he will appeal and that the appeal to the higher court against exile by his own party leader was recently successful. We cannot deny that nuclear proliferation is being exposed and stopped, that the Greek seamen have been returned to their own country or that the President has once again confirmed that he will cease to be the chief of the army.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless I support the trade agreement, as I have to recognise that Pakistan has recently made some encouraging moves in human rights, including women's rights, which deserve recognition and reward. Also, as a friend of India, historically Pakistan's giant neighbour and foe, I take great heart at the peaceful rapprochement as evidenced by several confidence-building measures, most visibly and recently the successful cricket tour.</p>
<p class="contents">Only three years ago the two states teetered on the verge of nuclear war. India is today in the midst of general elections as a beacon for democracy and prosperity. Its growth rate is now higher than China's and it does not want to see Pakistan suffer economically.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent campaign in Waziristan shows Islamabad's intent to prosecute a war against al-Qa'ida strongholds in tribal areas, historically no-go areas for the government of President Musharraf, who has now pressured tribal leaders to hunt down Islamist militants.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe human rights clauses should not be in trade agreements, as this muddies the waters, but should instead be conditional on aid received. Otherwise, does the EU stop trading with Russia, China, Uzbekistan or Iran, to name a few examples of countries with human rights problems?

A stable and democratic Pakistan would be a benign influence in the region, especially in the context of neighbouring Afghanistan. There are benefits to what is proposed. I fully understand the passion that has been injected into this debate by Mr Cushnahan but I do not understand the choice of language. It is not a good strategy to portray those who disagree with you as selling out or as being puppets. Perhaps when he has the opportunity he might like to reconsider those words. You can have principled positions and you can also have pragmatism; they do not rule each other out.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I too compliment Mr Cushnahan on the work that he has done and I compliment also Mr Brok, as chairman, on his work and that of his committee. The conclusion of the agreement would help the European Union to better engage with Pakistan on the very issues that Mr Cushnahan touches upon, the issues on which we want to have changes. Perhaps the last speaker is right when he suggests that human rights issues and issues relating to democracy should be completely excluded from trade agreements, perhaps not.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of other contributors made points with which I can certainly agree. Mr Ford indicated clearly that there are concerns, and that he fully appreciates the nature of the concerns, but then made the point that even he, as a Member who is close to the issue, can still support the position which has been taken by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the position which will be voted on here with regard to the third generation agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schröder demonstrated again the logic of support for the third generation agreement in his contribution, as indeed did Mr Howitt who reflected the same view and again illustrated the dangers of taking the view that every issue is only either black or white.</p>
<p class="contents">I take very much to heart the comments of Chairman Brok; I only hope that the Council and the Commission will maintain a sense of balance should the third generation agreement be ratified. I think Elmar Brok is correct in this particular viewpoint, which is the balanced one. It gives us a basis on which we can engage with the Pakistanis. The Presidency will not lose sight of the fact that there remain many serious negative issues in relation to Pakistan and we will certainly seek to ensure that the Union maintains pressure on the Pakistani authorities during the period of Ireland's presidency. Equally, I have no doubt whatsoever that this will also be the position taken by successive presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Again I want to thank you, Mr President, and I want to thank the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Cushnahan, who made a storming speech which reflects his own passionate commitment to democracy, that it came as a modest surprise to me to be described as a 'puppet of Washington and London'. This will improve my street credibility in certain parts of the House, but anybody who was in the Chamber this morning may find that a slightly outlandish description of your humble servant. All is fair in love and war and I recognise that the honourable Member's speech was, as I said, a reflection of the passion that he feels about this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">One direct question was asked of me and – admirably, because it is not always thus – the person who asked the question has stayed behind to hear the answer. I am not prepared – though I understand the importance of the issue – to agree to procedures for this agreement that we do not apply to any other, but I note that the agreement itself contains a suspension clause which both sides can invoke in the event of a breach of an essential element of the agreement. Article 1 of the agreement on human rights and democratic principles is such an essential element. The Commission is fully aware that this requires constant monitoring and this is, in fact, already being done. There is an EU working group on human rights in Islamabad which produces regular reports. It is perfectly possible for Parliament to debate those reports whenever it wishes. Regular dialogue on human rights will be strengthened once the agreement is in place. If the suspension clause is invoked by one of the parties, a consultation mechanism is provided for under the agreement itself, though I sincerely hope there will be no need for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I would like to thank Parliament for what has been an interesting and passionate debate. The issues raised are of great importance. However, as I have said repeatedly – not least in the committee presided over by the honourable Member – on balance, now is the time for Parliament to vote in favour of this third-generation agreement with a country of considerable importance, both within the region and globally, and of considerable importance not least to our own geostrategic interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
