<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ahern (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the report on safety at Sellafield, published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is a damning indictment of safety at the plant and falsification of safety checks there. In mid-February Chief Inspector Laurence Williams said that he himself would pull the plug on the THORP reprocessing plant if his safety recommendations were not acted on. However, it is clear from his own report that BNFL cannot be trusted. The response to previous recommendations by the NII was to ignore them. Indeed, I have documents showing this to be the case as far back as 1981. This shows arrogance, even when they are called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we to make of the fact that this investigation by the UK Nuclear Inspectorate resulted from a press report in the UK <span class="italic">Independent</span>, following which the UK Government sent in a posse, as it were – the Nuclear Inspectorate. Surely it should have been the other way around. We received continuous reassurance regarding the safety of EU nuclear installations, so why does it need a press investigation to alert Member State governments to serious safety issues?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time that the citizens of Europe received detailed answers to the questions of the effect on safety and the environment of the falsification of data in the MOX facility at the BNFL Sellafield site – falsification that has been ongoing for some years – because of the seriousness of the questions it raises for the safety of MOX fuel in use and for the nuclear installation's safety generally. It also raises questions for the transport of nuclear material such as MOX fuel and, indeed, for nuclear safeguards because of the production of plutonium stockpiles. Indeed, I would ask what level of Euratom safeguard efforts, personalities, site visits etc. has been deployed on that site since 1996 since when, we are told, reprocessing in the UK has been performed under Euratom safeguards?</p>
<p class="contents">I questioned Chief Inspector Laurence Williams in committee on whether the inspectorate staff in the UK were going native and imbibing the cultures that they are there to control. He gave me a serious answer. However, what about Euratom inspectors? Can we trust them? Do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards, because here we received conflicting answers in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also directly concerned with the effects of reprocessing on neighbouring states, such as my own, where radioactive contamination from Sellafield has been found on the east coast beaches, in particular Carlingford Lough, where I grew up. Local people often ask me what the EU is going to do about it. I can give them very short answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark and other Nordic states are also concerned at the radioactive contamination of their seas and fishing grounds from reprocessing at Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the scandal of abuse of safety at Sellafield is a European question. In particular, the high-level waste tanks pose a serious, on-going risk to the east coast of Ireland because of the risk of a release of large amounts of radiation should the cooling tanks overheat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nuclear Inspectorate's report stressed that the amount of high-level liquid waste continues to increase faster than BNFL can deal with it. The THORP reprocessing plant produces continually more waste. It is this plant that the inspectorate threatened with legal sanctions if the backlog is not cleared. Reprocessing by its nature produces large quantities of liquid waste. For more than 40 years high-level liquid waste has been stored in tanks at Sellafield under constant cooling. It is now urgent that we cease reprocessing and that the high-level waste tanks be shifted to passive containment such as vitrification. Even then, they will still be highly radioactive for more than 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for BNFL is that the amount of high-level liquid waste produced by reprocessing continues to increase faster than it can deal with it. The NII would like to see the minimisation of the amount of high-level liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential hazard. I would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee I also queried whether a culture of corruption had spread to the independent quality assurance verification by Lloyd's Quality Assurance who verify that BNF procedures comply with health and safety requirements. Last September it published a report stating that BNFL has high-quality management in terms of health, safety and the environment. As this was clearly inaccurate, according to the regulator's report, this independent verification now lacks credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already talked about going native in regard both to Euratom and the UK inspectorate. This is the polite euphemism for corruption, and that is what we must control here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chief Inspector recommended that the high-level waste tanks and the serious risk resulting from the inability of BNFL to make them passively safe through vitrification was an urgent issue. I would ask what does "urgent" mean in this context? Must we wait for years more of serious risk to the health and environment of people in the British Isles and Europe generally?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – The Commission is informed of the events surrounding the falsification of the pellet diameter data at the MOX demonstration facility and the BNFL Sellafield site. We are closely following the developments and have made direct contact both with the UK authorities and with the company. The Commission is highly concerned with this event which raises questions in relation to nuclear safety. Before I refer to the specific aspects raised by Mrs Ahern in her question, I would therefore firstly like to state that we cannot tolerate any negligence in relation to nuclear safety within the present and greater European Union. The neglect of internationally agreed nuclear safety standards should be openly and firmly condemned. I am therefore grateful that the European Parliament decided to debate this important issue in plenary tonight and to adopt a resolution later this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the first specific issue which is the implications of the MOX data issue for the safety of nuclear installations. Let me first remind the honourable Members that under the International Convention on Nuclear Safety the responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the state having jurisdiction over a nuclear installation. It is also clear that our Member States do not wish to give up this responsibility. I therefore need to refer to the UK and the NII report on the falsification of the data which states that the nuclear installations inspectorate is satisfied that the fuel manufactured in MDF will be safe in use in spite of the incomplete QA records caused by the falsification of some AQL data by process workers in the facility. That is a quote from their report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the inspectors' report on the control and supervision of operations at the BNFL Sellafield site also stated its opinion on the deterioration in safety performance at Sellafield. The company has reacted to the requirement of the NII to produce a programme responding to the recommendations in the report. We are now awaiting the formal reaction of the inspector to this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on nuclear safeguards: according to the investigations carried out by the UK nuclear installations inspectorate, the falsification of data occurred during a secondary manual diameter check of a sub-set of the MOX pellets in the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility. As far as Euratom nuclear material safeguards are concerned, checks of the diameter of pellets are not covered since operators' declarations for safeguards are based on pellet weights and not on a diameter measurement. Therefore the verifications performed by Euratom safeguards did not indicate that these declarations had been incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in relation to the transport of nuclear materials, transport of radioactive material is implemented according to regulations that are elaborated by the IAEA and transposed into national legislation. Therefore, also for the transport of radioactive material the prime responsibility lies with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As such the measurement deviations at Sellafield do not have any consequences on the safe transport of pellets. However, the Commission welcomes any decision which would increase even further the safe transport of nuclear material. The Commission has as its objective to promote the harmonisation of the regulations in the field of transport of radioactive material, which would increase safety in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the concept of proposing a Euratom directive for harmonising minimum standards for nuclear safety in the European Union and its value in discussions of nuclear safety with the accession states: individual EU Member States' safety requirements are more specific and demanding than those of the International Atomic Agency. Because of different historical background, legal framework, type and numbers of reactors and different approaches to regulation, they cannot easily be harmonised into a set of common rules. My concern is that any attempt to achieve a consensus on a set of common Euratom safety standards might only result in a very generalised set of rules and principles. As such they would be unlikely to improve on current nuclear installations' safety standards. It is therefore unlikely that harmonising minimum standards at an EU-level would have been able to prevent what happened at Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, several activities at Community level where harmonisation would be both beneficial and possible. These activities are based on common recognition of national requirements and the promotion of best practices. One area where there is scope for in-depth harmonisation is in relation to new types of facilities. I do not see any obstacles to future harmonisation of rules in the field of safe management of radioactive waste and decommissioning of nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of enlargement, a directive setting out harmonised minimum safety standards might have facilitated our early discussions on the very sensitive issue of nuclear safety. As part of the Community's <span class="italic">acquis</span> it then would have been routinely screened together with other EU legislation. However, it is difficult to say if such a directive would be developed quickly enough to play a key role in the ongoing discussions with the accession states. It is also difficult to prejudge if common minimum standards would give us the level of safety that we wish the accession states to aim for. We have in fact set our sights and those of the accession states beyond such a level. We are working to encourage the applicant states to apply the good practices in use in the European Union. One example of this is the development by the DG-Environment of guidelines for periodic safety reviews of the Soviet-designed light water nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major step forward was taken only last week with the setting up of a European nuclear installation safety group. It will bring together nuclear power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to pursue the objective of a high level of nuclear safety, both within the present Union and an enlarged one. I am convinced that more could be done at Community level to achieve this. However, it is not clear that a directive requiring the harmonisation of safety standards at a European level at this moment in history is the best way forward.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that we stick to facts and avoid some of the wilder claims that have been put in the Green motion for a resolution on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that safety was not compromised in the incident of record falsification. I would like to quote also from the NII report that the fuel manufactured in MDF, the MOX Demonstration Facility, will be safe in use in spite of incomplete quality assurance records caused by the falsification of some acceptable quality-level data by process workers in the facility. The NII takes this view on the basis of the robustness of the fuel manufacturing process and the totality of the checks made on the key parameters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw colleagues' attention to the positive response by BNFL to the two reports made by the NII, one on the records incident and the other on the control and safety management regime at Sellafield. I welcome the response and their three key recommendations to improve the safety management system and management structure by implementing a comprehensive overhaul of the safety management system across the company. To improve resource availability by taking on more monitoring staff, by improved training and further emphasising the safety culture and thirdly, to improve independent inspection, audit and review by appointing independent senior compliance inspectors and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">BNFL has responded positively to the 28 recommendations in one report and 15 recommendations in the other, the falsification report. I do not propose to go through those in great detail. I have no time. Let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here. Regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance. Members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course. There was no actual breach of safety, only a breach of record-keeping regulations for one particular customer. The offence of falsification of records must not negate or obscure the long-term case for reprocessing or MOX fuel assemblies.</p>
<p class="contents">Both of these are forms of recycling. Both of them are effective ways of reducing, of concentrating waste and in the case of MOX manufacture are the best answer known presently to the issue of safe disposal of weapons grade plutonium.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association WENRA which was formed just over a year ago in February 1999. I welcome their launching of a project aimed at harmonising its members' safety rules and practices. The regulators themselves are undertaking this job across Member States: who better to undertake that task? The result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the vast majority of United Kingdom citizens or indeed EU citizens were deeply shocked and dismayed at the recent events at BNFL. Let me quote BNFL's own words: "At company level it has been recognised that in the mind of many stake holders quality and safety are inextricably linked. Failure to comply in one aspect of an accredited quality system has led to a major loss in confidence in BNFL overall." That is from a management which is now aware of its shortcomings, a management that foolishly engaged in staff reductions, now reversed thank goodness.</p>
<p class="contents">The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation. I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management. Their livelihoods were endangered. They will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX. That is not under debate, although those matters should be debated in the UK and elsewhere. BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly. The main reason this is being raised in the European Parliament is to point out the lack of European harmonised standards in the nuclear industry. There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry. The Euratom Treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need. We cannot really contemplate enlargement without some sort of <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the nuclear sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication. Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further. I think one is needed in the near future indicating how we could achieve more harmonisation – of course not at the lowest standards in existence but at the most stringent. If you want public acceptance – and many of you do – of the nuclear industry, you have to ensure that.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner you say that as far as new facilities are concerned, if there are to be any, you feel that there is a case. I really do not see the difference, and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee, look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in February of this year into the safety records found that these records had been systematically falsified. The processing of spent fuel from 34 plants in 9 different countries was thrown into doubt and, indeed, Japan, Germany and Switzerland stopped sending material – and quite rightly so – to Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole sorry tale has added to the UK's reputation, as sordid as it is often inaccurate, as the "dirty man of Europe". I believe that all at Sellafield must accept collective responsibility for the things that have gone wrong and must act to improve them.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of improvements have been made: the new chairman of BNFL has undertaken a fundamental review; a number of people have been dismissed. There is undoubtedly progress. However, there is a lot yet to be achieved and there is a long way for the UK to go, and for BNFL to go to re-establish its reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ally myself with the concerns of Mrs McNally, when she asked the Commissioner to look again at these matters. The fact is that the Commissioner telling us that the rules of individual Member States are more specific is simply not good enough. We need high minimum standards and, in particular, we need those standards in the light of the accession of candidate countries, many of which are more reliant on nuclear technology than existing members of the Union and have much older generating capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of European Union action in this matter is that it will be a confidence-building measure, and what the public want are confidence-building measures. I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark. The fact is that we need legislation to implement what is called for in the motion put forward by the three main political groups tonight: high minimum standards for the safe and reliable design, construction and operation of nuclear and nuclear-related installations, as well as for nuclear-safety management systems.</p>
<p class="contents">My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight. We feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms. It raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at Sellafield. But one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers. We support the motion put forward by the three major political groups because we believe that improvements need to be made, improvements are being made, but that those improvements will be encouraged by an EU-wide approach to this whole matter. We recognise too the great significance of this plant for employment in west Cumbria and we believe that should the future of the plant be thrown into jeopardy then the European Commission must come forward with special measures to help regenerate other employment in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a saga in which nobody, least of all Sellafield, comes out well. But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one in this House could have been anything but appalled at the recent events linked to Sellafield, with the falsification of MOX fuel data and the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate's report on the low level of safety procedures at the plant. Following the initial defensive response by BNFL, it was only when that report was published that the real scale of the problem emerged, that the falsification of figures had apparently been going on secretly since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Wales, like Ireland, has suffered from the radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea, due essentially to Sellafield. There has been a theory about a link between a high incidence of childhood leukaemia, for example, and proximity to the Welsh coastline. Now, added to that, we have a situation where any confidence the public had in the safety of the plant, and therefore their own health and safety, has been destroyed. It is this crisis of credibility in the management of British Nuclear Fuels which may actually bring about the end of reprocessing.</p>
<p class="contents">BNFL was determined to press ahead with the Sellafield MOX plant to keep reprocessing going. But one of the reasons why British Energy, which accounted for a third of Sellafield's reprocessing work, decided to shift from that to waste storage was on economic grounds. It was cheaper for them to store waste, and evidence published recently by the nuclear-free local authorities confirms this view.</p>
<p class="contents">So, with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health, as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost, what justification is left for nuclear processing? It is not worth the risks associated with it and, as the resolution states, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must reconsider this whole issue, including the production of MOX fuel, in the light of recent events and in the interests not only of people in Ireland and Wales but also in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">British Nuclear Fuels has an obligation to deal with the levels of waste that Mrs Ahern mentioned earlier in the safest way possible. That issue too is one of great concern to me because an area of Wales has been mentioned as a possible site for storing low-level radioactive waste. This is unacceptable. A strategic approach is needed. The nuclear industry has caused enormous damage already and we have to be certain that more and more communities and people's lives are not blighted by its legacy in future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the sake of this rigour, I would like to remind you of four facts relating to the case of the falsification of manual measurements of the diameter of MOX fuel pellets at the British Nuclear Fuels installation at Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are talking about secondary and superfluous controls at the request of a client, not a safety requirement; secondly, no nuclear safety requirement was violated; thirdly, there was no risk of radiation whatsoever; fourthly, no safeguard clause of the Euratom Treaty was violated since the measurements of the weight of the pellets were correct.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore talking about a dreadful case of a lack of professional ethics, which has done enormous economic and public relations damage to the company concerned, but this case had no implications whatsoever in terms of the safety of workers or the public. Nevertheless, a mishap like this reminds us, despite its trivial nature, of the need to give utmost priority to the constant control and improvement of the procedures in an installation such as the Sellafield reprocessing plant. This is the view of the British regulatory authority. This is clearly demanded in the resolution supported by our Group and we hope that this will be complied with in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant, both the management and the workers' representatives there over a good number of years, felt the issue more keenly than most. It exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of MOX fuel. However, we should note that the response of BNFL to the nuclear inspectorate report has already resulted in very significant management changes. These have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible. I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue. I would suggest that one of the roles of Parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also note that the chief inspector and the Commission made very clear to the industry committee that there were no safety implications at any of the Sellafield installations. Nuclear safeguards were not an issue, nor were there safety issues in relation to transport of nuclear materials. I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening. The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured.</p>
<p class="contents">But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent. We seek to apply standards to the applicant countries in eastern Europe and, I would suggest, beyond the applicant countries in eastern Europe. European Union standards applicable to all nuclear installations are still something that most of us want to see. We know that the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association is seeking harmonisation. I would hope that the Commissioner, as other colleagues have asked, will reconsider her position and actually support and encourage WENRA in this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced, on the basis of my own experience in a number of countries that this is the way to reassure public opinion. It is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe I am accurate in saying that literally in every one of those sixteen years the concerns of the Irish Government and the Irish people about the nuclear processing plant in Sellafield have been raised in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am always conscious, as I look around, that probably every light bulb in this Chamber is lit by nuclear energy, which explains the reluctance among many of the major European nuclear powers to address seriously the concern we have in Ireland. Our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the British Government. They have largely been treated – I regret to say – with indifference and indeed, very often with contempt. There now exists in Ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in Sellafield. The recent information about the falsification of documents just added to the deep sense of unease that is shared by people throughout our island.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant. We are aware that the Germans and the Japanese are sending their nuclear waste for processing to Sellafield because it is politically too uncomfortable for them to do it in their own countries because of concerns about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commissioner to reconsider her point. I also ask her another question: are any of the non-nuclear countries on the nuclear safety committee you mentioned? It is time that we realised that we must count the cost of processing the waste from these nuclear facilities as an intrinsic part of the cost. It is, generally speaking, more comfortable to leave that out, but this is a matter of extreme concern to the Irish Government, the Irish people and happily, also to the Danish Government. We are joined in our concerns by them as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not. I asked to speak because I want to try and help to get some truth into this debate. The trouble is, when you talk about nuclear issues – especially Sellafield – it is dominated by a distortion of the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mrs Ahern spoke, she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant. No, it did not! She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks. No, it did not! It made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks, as other speakers have said. She said the report came from a press statement in <span class="italic">The Independent</span>. No, it did not. The workers at BNFL raised the issue. They were the ones who discovered it. BNFL were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened. She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark. I quote from <span class="italic">The Independent</span> where seven prominent Danish scientists, who actually study as a professional interest the releases of radioactivity from Sellafield, said on 12 May: "There is no scientific basis for the claim that the present release of radioactivity from Sellafield causes an unacceptable contamination in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions". When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue!</p>
<p class="contents">She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety. That is an absolute insult to the people who work there, and more so to their families who live near that site! Those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe. They would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case. That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there. Then she finished by talking about corruption. That really is the last throw of the dice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I say to the Commissioner: the one thing you should do, apart from listen, is to pay a visit to Sellafield and find out the facts for yourself. That is the best advice that I can give you and many Members of this Parliament also.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us be clear. There have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed. Those lapses quite simply are not acceptable. Speaking as a Cumbrian I know a lot of people in my home county – which I have the privilege to represent – feel let down by British Nuclear Fuels. But as has already been pointed out, there have been no breaches of the law or of the regulator's rules and guidelines. In a society subject to the rule of law recent events cannot be used to close the plant.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are many people who would like to see Sellafield closed down. In particular I know this is a very strongly held view in parts of Ireland. In a free society, if that is how people feel, they must be allowed to articulate their opinions. But that is no reason why the plant should be closed. There can be no question of any lawfully established enterprise in any part of the European Union being closed by the public authorities without its breaking the law. This true in Ireland, Denmark, the United Kingdom or any other Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The owners – that is to say the United Kingdom Government – and the employees of Sellafield have legitimate interests which quite simply cannot be swept under the carpet. This applies in this case just as much as to anybody else.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just as the recent crisis at Sellafield has been self-inflicted, so the solution to it lies in British Nuclear Fuels' hands, as they themselves understand. I wish them well. But words are not enough. They must be matched by deeds – their deeds.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate, embarrassingly inadequate. No uniform standards for safety and discharges, no Community consultation procedure concerning power stations sited near frontiers, no clear Community provisions for the storage and transport of nuclear fuels or nuclear waste, no adequate Community system of information and monitoring in cases of nuclear malfunction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern. As there are no prescribed criteria in EU law governing the design or operation of nuclear facilities, how do we judge their safety of operation? Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks. Society usually accepts a certain level of risk in return for an advantage and proponents of nuclear energy almost inevitably remind us of the balance of risk and benefit. What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain's nuclear installations?</p>
<p class="contents">If nuclear safety and nuclear energy are so safe, why are not the majority of these installations located near the population centres of the south-east of England? To minimise the risk to these population centres of course. But seen from an Irish perspective, this stands logic on its head, we have counties Antrim, Down, Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford where the vast majority of the population of the island of Ireland, about 2 million people, live on or adjacent to the Irish sea where the majority of British nuclear institutions are sited.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore in recent years, we have all seen how consumer concern about the integrity of the food chain can devastate a once seemingly secure market. Witness the BSE and dioxin problem. We can only begin to imagine the effect of any kind of nuclear scare – just a scare – on these sectors of our economy. Choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one's children is a very basic human right. This right to determine, to control, to have any say about the risk of nearby concentrations of nuclear installations is denied to those of us who inhabit the western shores of the Irish sea. In practice, nuclear decision-making in the UK falls far short of democratic standards. Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude. The reality of Sellafield goes beyond the contribution to the Kyoto targets on the dependence of the UK economy on nuclear energy. It also includes a litany of unreported incidents, falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel rods resulting in the loss of confidence by the Japanese in safety standards at the plant and the cancellation by the Germans and the Swiss of mixed oxide nuclear fuel pellets.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality of Sellafield includes incidents last September and early this year of deliberate sabotage, allegedly by members of the staff. Serious doubts are being raised about the long-term viability of reprocessing. Their order books are full for a few more years, but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant. Even the new CEO, Mr Norman Askew, is reported as saying that reprocessing is not the big part of the business it once was. A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt. But a nuclear future for Sellafield can be justified: not mixed oxide fuel production, not thermal oxide reprocessing at the MOX and THORP plants. The skills and the experience of the workforce and the major capital investment could and should be redirected towards waste management and the creation of a centre of excellence for decommissioning and that is what I suggest we concentrate the debate on.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that we can all agree on the need for confidence-building because, even though the conclusion is that this incident did not cause substantial damage or serious risks, we see that the price of the loss of confidence is very high. It is in the interest of all of us to ensure that our citizens have confidence in our safety and security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ready to come any time to any committee in Parliament to discuss those issues. I can say that personally I would very much prefer to have Community rules. But we must not give the impression that this would mean higher levels of safety in the European Union, because with the unanimity rule on the decisions on these issues, the end-result could be that we have minimum standard rules which would not live up to the expectations of our citizens. We must be realistic, because we know the discussion and the position and attitude among the Member States: they are not willing to give the European Union more competence in this area. That is also why the Commission's responsibility in this area is restricted to control radioactivity – but no more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">We need European rules. However, we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly. I share the view that we ought to discuss it more thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Banotti's question, this European Nuclear Installation's safety group brings together the power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states. It is not a wider forum but they can cooperate in this specific safety group.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the first time that Sellafield has been discussed and we need to look into the safety issues very closely because, you remember, there was an accident in Japan. That was because of lax control and some of the staff thought they could make a mix of their own. So even in highly advanced societies there are serious risks with nuclear and processing techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be pleased to come to Parliament at any time to continue this discussion. However, I do not want to give anyone false hopes about what can be achieved very quickly and with the help of Member States. That is also why we have restricted competence.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
