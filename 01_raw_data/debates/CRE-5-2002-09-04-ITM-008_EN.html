<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing European citizenship on the basis of the report which I had the honour of drafting and which was given almost unanimous approval in our Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I must begin by emphasising what is essential and what we do not want. What is essential is to promote awareness of a common heritage, based on a range of fundamental common traditions and values and, at the same time, of the recognition of a number of rights. What we do not want is a concept of European citizenship that is seen as the artificial creation of a supranational identity that seeks to replace feelings of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as we understand it, European citizenship is something to be superimposed and added to national citizenship, complementing and broadening it. There is no way of acquiring this other than having nationality one of the Member States. Although our Community has taken an essentially economic route, it is now much more than an economic community. It is home to more than 375 million people, who are not only consumers in a vast single market, but are also citizens of the European Union, who have the right to move freely within it, to settle in any part of its territory, for personal or professional reasons, and who hope to be able to live without fear of persecution, discrimination or violence, which accentuates the need to step up cooperation between police forces, customs services and judicial systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognition of this European citizenship has been a slow process, however, which faces too many obstacles, even today. There are eight areas in which I am submitting proposals for the full application of the concept of European citizenship in its political, administrative, judicial, social and economic dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">First: it is crucial that we implement a strategy of promoting European citizenship, at both the institutional and legislative levels, and in terms of education and information.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the lack of information. European citizens must be better informed of their rights and the scope of these rights, with regard in particular to the right to petition the European Parliament and to complain to the Ombudsman. It is deplorable that most of the petitions to the European Parliament and the complaints sent to the Ombudsman are deemed unacceptable, which confirms the lack of knowledge of the petitioners about the competences of the Union. It is crucial to improve, through all available means, the European Union’s information and communication policy, which must be targeted and appropriate to the population for whom it is designed. The Union’s document base must be made accessible to the public in all the official languages and free of charge and the development of interactive portals must be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: the steady decline in the rate of participation of the Union’s citizens in European elections, which undermines the legitimacy of our Parliament. We must adopt the measures needed to further raise voter awareness of the importance of these elections. With regard to setting a date for the next European elections, this must not coincide with national traditions or statutory holidays, so as to optimise the chances of voter participation. It does not make sense, for example, that in Portugal the day of the Europeans elections frequently coincides with a national holiday, thereby seriously damaging the electoral participation of the citizens of my country.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: diplomatic and consular protection. It is important that those Member States that have not yet done so incorporate into their legal systems the measures needed to ensure diplomatic and consular protection for EU citizens whose state of origin has no representation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth: protection of the citizens. The Member States must adopt all the measures needed to ensure that fundamental rights are respected, the protection of the citizens against terrorism and organised crime, support and compensation for victims, and to ensure the effective and equitable access of European citizens to justice. Particular emphasis is given to the implementation of the directives on combating discrimination, to the fight against racism and xenophobia and to equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth: the continued existence of obstacles to the exercise of freedom of movement and residence by European citizens. In order to overcome these obstacles, Member States must adopt without delay the proposal for a directive of 23 May 2001, which, by revising the existing texts, introduces essential simplifications and in particular establishes the right of permanent residence after four years of uninterrupted residence. Furthermore, the Member States must remedy the many legislative discrepancies which continue to exist and which represent an obstacle to the full expression of European citizenship in the areas of the status of individuals, justice and conditions of movement and residence for migrant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventh: barriers to the free movement of students and teachers. With regard to barriers that still remain, the action plan for mobility must be adopted as a matter of urgency, so as to facilitate and enhance the mobility of students, volunteers, teachers and trainers. Furthermore, the Member States and the competent authorities must use educational programmes to encourage a better knowledge of Europe, particularly in the form of history and language teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Convention on the Future of the European Union to agree on the binding legal status to be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to communitarise the third pillar, and to endeavour to ensure that texts in which EU policies are laid down are more accessible to the general public as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Committee welcomes some of the actions that have been adopted but which must be implemented. First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Based on the principles of human dignity and equality of<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>women and men, the Charter will serve as a framework defending the fundamental rights of women and men in the Union. Also the Daphne Programme, created to defend the citizens’ rights of children, adolescents and women, must be further developed as an instrument to strengthen European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan for mobility and the Commission proposal to adopt a directive combining the various legislative instruments on the freedom of movement and residence of the citizens of the Union in a single text is of particular importance to women and the problems they face in the framework of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission, in its next report, to provide an adequate analysis based on comparable statistics, which enables a gender impact assessment to be made in areas linked to the electoral process, such as the percentage of women voters, of women who stand as candidates and, of course, of women who are elected. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us remember that strengthening citizenship of the Union will only be achieved through total equality between men and women in all sectors of economic and political life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the citizens are starting to feel European, and this is happening as they begin to enter into dialogue with the European institutions. However, there is more to citizenship than that: in a way, it confirms the citizens’ place in this European dimension, which they must feel both contributors to and responsible for at this time of great impetus and dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the level of participation in the European elections is low and declining steadily, but we wonder what we are offering the citizens of the Member States as part of this European package. We are not offering them the mutual right to study in different Member States, we are not providing facilities to resolve language difficulties, we are not providing a labour code, we are not – as Mr Coelho, who has produced an excellent report, pointed out – providing free movement, we are not recognising qualifications and, therefore, we are not recognising a right to work, and we are not recognising the right to health. I am saying this on behalf of the citizens, for I receive the petitions sent by the citizens to the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, in which they describe these major areas of intolerance within the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would next like to point out a major contradiction: we have achieved Schengen, which is a milestone which could benefit the whole world, particularly the countries which are still troubled by wars over territory and border conflicts, but we are preserving the right for the Member States to expel European Union citizens from one Member State to another. How is it conceivable that the right of expulsion still exists when it runs counter to Schengen? We can expel citizens outside the Schengen area, not within the same territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, I feel that we should all make every endeavour to start building Europe at the level of the citizens, starting precisely with the recognition of status which the Charter of Fundamental Rights placed at the centre of the European project and which must be reproduced in the Treaties. If we do not succeed in doing this, however many conventions we produce we will never manage to build Europe, especially when one country – I am referring to Ireland but there may be many others, including my own – has refused to recognise, to sign and to ratify the Nice Treaty and when three Member States have refused to share our experience with the single currency. The road is long: we must all strive to place the citizens at the centre of the Europe we are building. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking at the basis for it, though, we find just six paragraphs referring to citizenship of the EU, and, on reading these, we find relatively few rights attached to it, which range from participation in local elections or in those for this Parliament to diplomatic representation or the right of petition.</p>
<p class="contents">That, though, can be nothing more than a beginning if we really want to create EU citizenship. The task we have to set ourselves in future is a political one, that of making EU citizenship, as it now is, meaningful and breathing life into it. We are also called on to give thought to how we can actually extend the rights enjoyed by EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This report turns the spotlight on our present deficits and also makes very definite proposals where changes are necessary. I very warmly congratulate the rapporteur on the attitude he has taken to this refined analysis and on the very constructive proposals he has made. There is a need for measures to demolish, and quickly, the barriers which exist at present and still hamper the freedom of movement and of residence of people who are called EU citizens, which do not guarantee all EU citizens access to the law and to justice to the extent that they desire, and which, above all, hamper the mobility of students in schools and higher education, of apprentices, and also of teachers and the workforce. What use to us is the best Leonardo programme for the training of professionals, if such things as social benefits are not recognised or if there are yet other barriers standing in the way of real mobility, or if qualifications from university or vocational training in other states are not accorded the recognition that has long been overdue?</p>
<p class="contents">We have to think about informing people about what their rights as citizens of the EU actually are and about how they can best make use of them. We have to call for the necessary work to be done in schools and in information offices – the latter including those run by the Commission and by Parliament. Much, then, lies ahead of us.

This is a clear and balanced report, which explains the existing shortcomings, recognises the progress that has been made and indicates the direction that must be taken to remedy these shortcomings, in the aim of constructing a real and effective European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of European citizenship has been one of the main legacies of the Maastricht Treaty and has contributed to increasingly engage the citizens of the Member States with the common project of European integration. Now that more than a decade has passed, the balance sheet is clearly positive. Freedom of movement, the right to vote and to stand in local and European elections, the right of petition and the right to diplomatic and consular protection are today already irreversible steps forward with practical effects from which Europe’s citizens derive real benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the development of a genuine European citizenship requires more, both with regard to those rights already enshrined in the Treaties, but whose full implementation today still faces too many obstacles, and with regard to the integration of the future institutional model of the Union, which is undoubtedly the great challenge currently facing our community of peoples and countries. Furthermore, full European citizenship cannot ignore the social and economic rights of our fellow citizens, at the risk of the citizens seeing the European project as a step backwards from the social contract expressed through national constitutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the freedom of movement and residence of Community citizens, I should like, Mr President, to congratulate the Commission on the reform that has been introduced in this field, formalised in the Directive of 23 May 2001. In the aim of guaranteeing the citizens of the European Union conditions of movement and residence similar to those of Member State citizens in their own country, this Commission initiative has made the conditions of movement and residence more flexible, has simplified the legislation in force in this field and has established an innovative rule according to which after four years, residence in European Union territory can be extended with no formalities required.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot distance itself from the situation of those who, although not Member State nationals, have their lives established on European territory, thereby making a major contribution to the cultural, social and economic wealth of the Union. It is, therefore, with considerable satisfaction that we welcome the Commission proposal for a directive of 5 July 2001, on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents. We urge the Council rapidly to adopt this proposal and thereby end the existing discrimination and to ensure that these persons can, in the field of employment, education and social security, enjoy rights close to those held by citizens of the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In the field of the right to vote and to stand for election, the report rigorously describes the present framework, which is characterised fundamentally by the poor participation of Community citizens in European and local elections in their States of residence. The lack of information and the short periods laid down by States Members in which citizens can be placed on electoral registers undoubtedly contribute to explaining this relative lack of success. Nevertheless, this phenomenon should be seen in the context of the more global trend of a steady decline in voter participation which, as far as we are concerned, could be effectively countered by clarifying the European Union’s institutional framework and by drafting a genuine constitutional text which enables the citizens to identify as closely as possible with the decision-making process at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate Mr Coelho on a very strong report, which is concrete and specific. He makes it clear that European citizenship not only supplements and complements national citizenship but also that the concept should adapt to include the rights of long-term resident foreign nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just take issue with him on one point. In 2004, elections to the Greater London Authority are due to take place one month before the European elections. I hope agreement will be reached to postpone them for one month so that they take place on the same day, which will help raise turnout and make a legitimate connection, in the sense of a Europe of the regions. Mr Coelho adopts a fully justified tone of impatience. The rights of people must not continue to lag behind the rights of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In several areas I fully support him: openness, transparency, freedom of information. In the EU we are still depressingly opaque and inaccessible. Information documents must become more available.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, of course our citizens want protection against crime and terrorism, but there is a very poor level of democratic scrutiny in the area of police and judicial cooperation. We must improve this situation. Also, measures to combat crime and terrorism must have due regard to respect for human rights, including the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur stresses elimination of discrimination, on which I fully support him, but I would also add that respect for cultural traditions must not be at the expense of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, life is too much of a hassle for people when they try to exercise their European rights, whether it be residence permits, family reunions, social security or access to justice. I have a constituent – and I have brought this to the attention of the Commissioner – against whom proceedings were brought in the civil courts in the UK and whose case was thrown out by the English High Court. Proceedings were then brought against her on the basis of exactly the same facts by the criminal courts in Spain and she suffered years of worry and expense, until the case was finally thrown out just a month or so ago. Why is there not mutual recognition of the same facts between a civil and a criminal case?</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is that we need to reinforce our monitoring of the implementation of citizenship and human rights standards. We must take the opportunity of transforming a process which is currently being applied to the candidate countries into a genuine European Union peer review process, so that the standards of citizenship and human rights applied in each of our Member States is the concern of all of us on a cross-national basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As stated in the Treaty, European citizenship supplements national citizenship, but is not a substitute for it. European citizenship should also be an added extra for everyone living in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2000, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights finally placed the citizen at the heart of European integration, eight years after the Treaty of Maastricht. It was high time indeed because, at European level as well as at national and local level, it is unthinkable to conduct politics in any way other than by placing citizens at the heart of all considerations, all social measures and all social projects. Despite being in a good position to know that, in practice, things work slightly differently, this must not prevent us from fighting to change things, quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur listed the areas that are meant to feature in European citizenship. There is therefore no need for me to repeat them. I am, however, deeply mindful of a whole series of social rights which were quoted by other speakers. The report gives an assessment of how these rights are being implemented. This assessment is not overly enthusiastic because, although it reports on progress made, it also highlights the fact that a great deal is still to be done in various areas. We mentioned voting at the European elections, in which less than 50% of voters took part. We must, therefore, put in place measures that will encourage citizens to take part in these elections and, above all, we must give renewed consideration to the link between the elected representatives and the electorate. We must, once again, inspire citizens with the desire to vote and the desire to become involved in community life. The citizen must be an actor and not just an observer. The recent elections in the various EU Member States also reinforce<span class="bold"> </span>this belief.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we also say about mobility for education purposes? I have been telling the authorities for years about the lack of recognition of qualifications. European citizens are calling for swift action to be taken in this area. What can we say about the mobility of researchers? I have been appointed rapporteur on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development and I know that this is a real obstacle course.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking the rapporteur for his thoughts and with the hope that, if we all pull together, we will be able to take steps to strengthen our approach and to go further in placing the citizen at the heart of our European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Coelho’s report is the necessary and appropriate complement to the third Commission report, giving it a crucial political meaning that is well expressed in the motion for a resolution, on which we shall be voting tomorrow. The report and the motion for a resolution address the matter adequately, dividing it into various strands with regard to the political, administrative, and judicial dimension, and lastly, into the strand of promoting European citizenship, which contains proposals for various practical actions. I do not wish to add anything to this, either in terms of the report’s analysis, or of the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have something to add, however, to the discussion, particularly when the Convention is up and running and the future of Europe and institutional reform are being so widely debated. It is true that we must work on promoting European citizenship and full understanding of this by our compatriots, our fellow citizens. The fact, however, that, ten years after Maastricht, with so many direct elections to the European Parliament having already been held and so many actions having been undertaken to promote and disseminate the European framework, on which enormous quantities of money are spent every year, after all this, the State of European citizenship is as portrayed by the Commission report and justifies some of the rapporteur’s complaints, forces us to keep our feet on the ground and to build the future with our eyes on the horizon – not as far into the horizon as the visionaries would like, but as far as the reality of the situation requires.</p>
<p class="contents">The real state of European citizenship – as demonstrated, for example, in the symptomatic low levels of electoral participation – shows, as the motion for a resolution points out and emphasises in line with the Treaty, that 'European citizenship shall not replace national citizenship, but complements and expands it'. In other words, and we must always bear this in mind, European citizenship is, for the overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens, a complementary citizenship, because it is the central place spontaneously occupied by the most intense sense of belonging and of identity with national citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this inescapable fact are many and profound. And so the future of Europe will only be achieved properly if this factor is borne in mind. Provided that we do this, we shall be constructing something – with the solidarity of the nations and the genuine democracy of the citizens. We shall be constructing something with a future, because it will have roots. When we distance ourselves from this goal, however, because we want to continue sleeping easy, we shall be opening the way to nightmares and to creating points of conflict, tension and disillusionment that will undermine the European project. Because we shall be giving in, ultimately, to the pressures of a new type of collectivism – multinational collectivism – and thereby distancing ourselves from democracy, affronting genuine citizenship and replacing that Europe of all citizens, of which we all dream, with bureaucratic jiggery-pokery.</p>
<p class="contents">European integration can be achieved by respecting the feelings of the citizens, and will be more secure as a result. It must never be done by overriding these feelings and must be done preferably together with the citizens. The Convention must also not forget this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the essence of the report before us, an excellent, high-quality, comprehensive report – and I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho – which is, at the same time, a kind of stock-take and revitalisation of the major project seeking to guarantee all the citizens equal opportunities, free movement, residence throughout the Community territory and free access to employment, justice and all rights, making innovative developments benefiting the citizens of third countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">These basic principles are complemented by the undertaking to provide all the citizens with a real job, a real house, adequate healthcare and prospects of social and other growth in addition to economic growth. Moreover, the recognition of fundamental rights must go hand in hand with the consolidation of measures to combat xenophobia, religious discrimination and discrimination on grounds of sex, race or social condition. A particularly interesting section is that exploring transnational methodologies for achieving practical police and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards these areas of cooperation, innovative proposals are also included relating to the involvement of the different groups of long-term legal immigrants. Particularly topical – as many Members have pointed out – is the concern expressed in a section of the report at the low level of interest hitherto displayed by the European citizens in respect of the European Parliament elections. If we encourage the development of genuine citizenship, this should be the decisive factor which will also lead to greater political awareness among the people at the time of European elections and to the many other forms of direct participation which are becoming increasingly available to all the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to make the citizens aware that European citizenship – a term which is often bandied about in this Chamber – does not replace national citizenship, which remains undiminished, retaining all its associations of cultural, historical and social roots which connect different races of peoples which, however, are united in a common destiny, the destiny of the European Union. We cannot, therefore, accept the amendments tabled by the GUE/NGL Group, which impose a certainly excessive and dangerous acceleration on the process of integration of citizens from all the third countries, who are resident in Community territory without distinction. This is certainly a desirable development which should be contemplated in the future – that active and passive voting rights and long-term residence permits should be granted to third-country citizens – but the time is not yet ripe for it to be fully implemented, at least for it to be implemented across the board and to include all nationalities. A number of disparities are still present and, not least, where some third countries are concerned, there is no desire for reciprocity of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is important that we succeed in establishing a fundamental concept: these issues fall strictly within the sphere of Community competence. Just recently, we read in the press that some Member States appear to be claiming regulation in this field as part of their own national competence. This would be a serious mistake: there cannot be any disparity in the ways major issues such as asylum, integration, the recognition of civil rights – including the right to vote, most importantly – and the right to citizenship are treated within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even the notion of citizenship is distinct from being a citizen. It is my view that citizenship derives in the first instance from a sense of responsibility which comes from within a moral framework – I am not talking specifically about a religious framework, but a moral framework of how one sees the world and one's place in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard myself as a citizen of the world. I do not have a piece of paper which tells me so, but there are various conventions and laws and international rights which exist and which protect me as a citizen of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that there is a lot of work to be done in terms of developing the notion of European citizenship and it is a mistake to reduce it to the notion of political citizenship, although that is an important aspect of it. Turnout in elections is important, but people's identity as citizens is not confined to their political identity. In fact many people, as we can see from the low turnouts, no longer define themselves in political terms and therefore disengage from the political process. Many are far more interested in their identity as, for instance, fans of a football club or a particular pop star.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of good ideas in this report. One of the most interesting is the simple idea of a national holiday on Europe Day. This would create a connection between Europe and the people of Europe. It would bring home very strongly the idea that there is a benefit to being a European and being part of the European process.</p>
<p class="contents">As an exercise, I logged onto one of the more popular websites a few minutes before I came down here and I found 1.8 million references to citizenship. At the top of the list were the United States, Canada and then the UK. On the first thirty pages, I was not able to find a single site for the European Union. It seems to me that is a mistake. One of the things that the sites constantly emphasise is education – the education of young people. I would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it is concerned about the steadily declining turnout for European elections, which reflects the citizens’ lack of interest and may, if it continues, and I quote, 'delegitimise the elections to the European Parliament'. It also states, similarly, that a European citizenship cannot be created solely from above and that a minimum level of citizen participation is required. All this is perfectly true.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, if we look for the cause of this lack of interest, we find them in the proposals of the Coelho report itself. For example, the Opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs annexed to the report asks yet again for transnational lists for European elections to be established, which would be the best way to increase the citizens’ sense of distance from the Union. The report itself contains the traditional request to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, which would have the distinctive feature of removing the definition of a good number of citizens’ rights from national democracies. In relation to this, I would point out that the Charter neatly sidesteps national citizenships and does not even mention the fundamental right of citizens to express themselves democratically within their own nation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Coelho report also calls, in paragraph 3, for immigrants from third countries to be granted rights which are as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens. In other words, European citizenship would be granted in practice, if not in principle, to immigrants who are not nationals of a Member State. Could this manner of proposal make our citizens love Europe? I do not need a public answer from you now, ladies and gentlemen, but I would ask you to think it over.</p>
<p class="contents">To briefly summarise, all these proposals and a good many others that I could refer to tend to reduce or limit the rights of nations. Even now, however, the institutions of the Union do not seem to understand the basic fact that citizens are deeply attached to their nations and by attacking or by downgrading their nations they are hurting citizens and turning them away from Europe. In this way, even if our citizens are convinced, as we are, of the importance and need for European cooperation, it is the Union’s own attitude that turns them off Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must have a radical change of attitude if it wants to regain contact with its citizens. The Convention that is meeting to prepare the IGC 2004 will afford us the opportunity in the months to come. The proposals that result from it must give out a clear signal that Europe must be built on its nations and that it will respect their laws. In particular, it must be clear, not only that the European citizenship does not replace national citizenships, but also that it remains subordinate to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EU citizenship is a logical extension of the various long established <span class="italic">de facto</span> rights and obligations of various kinds between the EU and Member State citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">A natural step towards EU citizenship would, of course, be a binding charter clearly stating and clarifying the fundamental rights and obligations. The charter should be seen as an important part of the principles of EU citizenship and would be at the very heart of citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for EU citizenship has become fully obvious in the light of the necessary restrictions on individual rights that followed the 11 September catastrophe. The need for a developed EU citizenship thus becomes clear, a citizenship that provides a better definition of the basic contract between the individual and the EU and balances rights and restrictions in the same political decision-making system.</p>
<p class="contents">With every day that passes it becomes increasingly difficult to understand why some social democratic governments oppose merging the Communities and the Union, yet this is absolutely necessary in order to clarify the fundamental obligations and rights. Without that simplification, any EU citizenship will be difficult to grasp and more or less impossible to communicate to EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that the outcome of ongoing national elections could have both a positive and a negative impact on citizens’ rights. EU citizenship <span class="italic">could </span>provide an important tool for explaining to European citizens what EU membership means. However, this requires a clearer, simpler Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament representative on the Interinstitutional Committee on Access to Documents, I have reached an agreement with the Council representative, Mr Haarder, on information focusing directly on the citizen. The idea is to show citizens how and where they can obtain the information that will enable them to take part in European democracy, by giving a simple summary of citizens’ rights in European daily newspapers. The funds for this are there but it is taking <span class="italic">far</span> too long to mobilise the political will. This could be a simple way of creating an understanding of citizenship. Consequently, it would be unacceptable if this proposal were delayed just now when it is so important for European democracy. The Commission, which is responsible for organising the next interinstitutional meeting, should therefore promptly – very promptly – organise such a meeting to ensure that Europe’s democratic progress is not delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his very constructive contribution to the democratic development of Europe, in which EU citizenship plays such a central role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a distortion of the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same breath as citizens’ rights are defined as ‘European rights’, taking precedence over rights based on national legislation, in precisely the same breath, national citizenship is undermined. European citizenship is purely and simply integration through the back door. This political pickpocketing is at once antidemocratic and repressive. What is being proposed is the absorption of vital parts of countries’ legal systems, including criminal law and the police, into European citizenship. The belief seems to be that these genuine values – democracy and the rule of law – can be acquired for the DKK 2 000 million which the Commission has just allocated to strengthen the legitimacy of the European institutions.</p>

I believe that the objectives, which in 1992 ensured that European citizenship was included in the Treaty of the Union, have not lost any of their relevance. Citizenship of the Union is, of course, a source of legitimacy for the process of European integration and strives to increase the participation of the citizens in the construction of a Community-centred Europe. Furthermore, citizenship is a crucial factor in the establishment, amongst the citizens, of the concept of belonging to the European Union and of having a genuine common European identity. This identity is constructed, however, on respect for diversity, because national diversity is an integral part of the specific European identity. Therefore, it neither replaces nor conflicts with national identity, but rather complements it.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall take this opportunity to express my thanks for the report that has been presented today on the Third Commission Report on Citizenship of the Union and I should like, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, not only on the quality of his report, but also on the way in which he structured the issue and on the clarity of the political objectives that he has attached to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree that the concept of European citizenship must be implemented in all its dimensions, be they political, administrative, judicial, social or economic. We have reached a position in which citizens’ rights are, in the Member States of the Union, broadly respected, but in which there are still some legal discrepancies and practical obstacles to the full expression of European citizenship. We must further strive to resolve these discrepancies and obstacles, which prevent the citizens from enjoying their rights as European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aspects highlighted in the report is the lack of information, one result of which is the low level of awareness of European citizenship. What is required is for European Union policy in the field of information and communication to be strengthened by all available means. This observation made by the rapporteur is shared by the Commission, whose report repeatedly highlights the need to better inform the citizens on the rights to which they are entitled. I believe it is common knowledge that the Commission adopted, last July, a new approach to information and communication policy and I believe that this approach is necessary to counter the lack of knowledge and the apathy of European citizens about the debate on Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the European institutions clearly cannot, on their own, communicate with the 370 million people who make up the Union, or, if you wish, with the around 500 million following enlargement. The Member States must share responsibility for the provision of information, for dialogue with the citizens and for their recognition because European integration concerns them above all. And, as I understand it, there are now signs that the Member States have the political will to work together, thereby proving that there is no incompatibility between the feeling of national belonging and the feeling of participation in the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">It could, therefore, be considered that the 'Europe Direct' service, created by the Commission, is a success. Since 1998 this service has provided information on a whole range of matters concerning the European Union, thereby contributing to people knowing their rights and opportunities as citizens of the Union and knowing how to take advantage of them. Small steps are often, in practice, the most important ones. Such as, for example, the creation of the universal green number for 'Europe Direct', which enables citizens anywhere in the fifteen Member States to access an operator who speaks their national language and who can answer any question they wish to ask about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to information, I should further like to add that the Commission will shortly be studying how to raise citizens’ awareness of citizenship of the Union and of connected rights through a specific Eurobarometer survey. The survey will be launched with the title 'Ten Years of European Citizenship' and the results will be used as the basis for future information and communication measures in the field of citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wanted to include a framework for the structure of fundamental rights in its third report, specifically the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in December 2000. This caused – I admit – some delay in meeting the initial deadline for submitting the third report, but I think that the importance of the Charter fully justified this. Carlos Coelho’s report states that the Charter places European citizenship at the heart of the Union’s activities. I fully agree. I also agree with the report’s call for the Convention on the future of Europe to define the binding legal status that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be given. I believe that the most important debate to take place in the Convention, capable of producing real results to bring the citizens and the European institutions closer together, is not so much the debate on the institutions, but will perhaps be the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on its inclusion in the Treaties and on its legally binding nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens might remain distant when institutional questions are discussed, such as power-sharing between the bodies of the Union and legislative procedures, but are decidedly interested when it comes to knowing what rights they have and how the Union can meet their expectations. I also hope that the Council is able to approve the Commission proposal on reorganising the right to freedom of movement. This is the correct test to show that a freedom that is at the very heart of European citizenship has the same status of effectiveness and of political dignity as the freedom of movement of goods, capital or services.</p>
<p class="contents">I note, ladies and gentlemen, the suggestion that the Members of the future Convention should decide on the statute of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Given that I am one of the representatives of the Commission in the Convention, together with my colleague Michel Barnier, I shall not fail to express my support for the Charter having the strong statute that you wish to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
