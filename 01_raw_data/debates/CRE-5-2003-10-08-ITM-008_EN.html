<p class="contents">I would like to speak now about the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’. This agreement was the result of difficult, lengthy negotiations in which we all asked ourselves – Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but us, above all, I have to say – if it would not be better quietly to give up, given the difficulty of trying to find any real advantages over the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I would like to thank Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg, with whom we had a good working relationship, as well as the technical group that negotiated with us, for, ultimately, a positive outcome was, in any case, achieved. Therefore, if we are here to urge Parliament to support this agreement, it is because I believe that – albeit minor, tentative – progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus, in particular, on two issues that I feel are of particular significance: co-regulation and self-regulation. Not so much because the results achieved were ground-breaking but because I believe that, if we use it properly – particularly we in this House – this agreement will make it easier to combat an extremely worrying trend, which I am sorry to say the Commission and the Council seem to endorse, the trend towards alternative methods of regulation to legislation, and here I am referring, in particular, to what are known as voluntary agreements. Recent experience in the field of road safety and CO2 in cars has shown us that the risks of not achieving objectives, in terms of effectiveness and enforcement across the board, which a normal law could have achieved, are very real where these voluntary agreements are used. It is precisely in response to this potential danger that we have become extensively involved in this difficult debate, which included many other elements too – as Members will be able to see if they read the text, there is also a lot of waffle – but, at least, on the issues of self-regulation and co-regulation, some minor progress has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, fully admit to defeat in one area: we did not succeed in getting the right of call-back from the Commission – the right to suspend the use of a voluntary agreement if we do not approve of it. We are extremely disappointed about this because it was the Commission – and this has to be said – that did not want to step down on this point. We have simply obtained a political willingness from the Commission to take unambiguous, clear opposition from Parliament into consideration. If it is deemed necessary, it will, therefore, be up to Parliament to organise opposition to the voluntary agreement in order to force the Commission to recall it itself.</p>
<p class="contents">One last thing, Mr President: the difficulty that the Commission and the Council have in going further in this area seems to be exactly the same as that we encountered in the negotiations on comitology, which we hope has been overcome once and for all thanks to the agreements concluded by the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been dealing with this issue since the beginning of 2002. We were responding to several Commission communications which raised the problem of the shortcomings in Community regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember how, in conversation with a Spanish national legislator – a very experienced one, by the way – he told me that nobody could understand Community directives. We do so much work on them and so many people are involved in their production: the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and so many others, that in the end we have a text which could be described as a ‘camel’, in other words, a horse designed by a committee. And that is the real situation.</p>
<p class="contents">While we must recognise that the regulation is a little more appropriate, the directive, on the other hand, is a real disaster. The Commission’s natural concern was of course to improve this situation, a concern which the Council and Parliament also share. Above all at a time when Parliament is increasing its legislative powers, it makes no sense for us to continue with this procedure for producing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we in the Committee on Legal Affairs realised that, in order for the Commission's proposals to come to fruition, it would be necessary to provide a constitutional framework suited to this issue. We raised this within the first points of the report, and then the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which had decided to produce a series of reports after debating the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs, realised the importance of the issue in terms of Parliament’s institutional role and, on a very sound basis, accepted the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we insisted on our conviction – and that of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well – that it was necessary to reach an interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions in order to prevent the respective institutions from being deprived of their powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the result of this exercise – during which the two different committees of Parliament, Legal Affairs and Constitutional Affairs, have dealt with the issue – has been positive. I believe that the interinstitutional agreement reached is a good agreement and I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Frassoni, on the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the work she herself has done and also the good work done by President Gargani and many members of that interinstitutional working group – Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg – and we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are happy with the result.</p>
<p class="contents">This report for which I am rapporteur was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs before the interinstitutional agreement had been reached. We therefore proposed a series of recommendations to the interinstitutional group on it. Since the agreement has now been reached – and I believe that to a large extent our objectives have been achieved – I believe that the best option is for the report to be returned to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that we can, taking account of the actions included in the interinstitutional agreement, move forward on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist, of course – and here I agree with Mrs Frassoni – that we must deal with the problems of self-regulation and co-regulation. Because we are too happy to talk about civil society and then, when we talk about civil society here in the European Parliament and the European Union, we invite representatives from certain organisations, which somebody or other tells us are representative. But in reality, in democratic systems, civil society is expressed by means of the electoral process. The electoral process provides civil society with a formal means of expression, and the result of that electoral process is the legislative bodies, and it is they who have to adapt the general regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with self-regulation and co-regulation is that they represent a step backwards; they mean returning to the Middle Ages, when certain sectors produced rules which bound everybody. In modern societies, these rules must come from society as a whole, by means of elected bodies, elected through perfectly formalised and guaranteed processes, which in this case means the European Parliament, the Council – insofar as the Council is made up of governments with elected leaders answerable to their national Parliaments – and also the Commission, insofar as it is elected by the Council and by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have the impression that the interinstitutional agreement has placed certain restrictions, but we in this Parliament must continue to insist on the need, on the one hand, to improve the quality of Community legislation and, on the other, not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and not to give up the progress made in our Europe through the development of the liberal and democratic State, which ensures that decisions are made by legislative bodies elected by popular will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The initiative that led to the current outcome began with the Commission communication on better regulation and its action plan simplifying and improving the regulatory environment, but it was the enthusiasm of the European Parliament and its President that drove the European Council, which met in Seville in June 2002, to urge the three institutions to adopt an interinstitutional agreement which sought to improve the quality of Community law and the conditions of its incorporation, including deadlines, into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our three institutions replied immediately to the request and opened negotiations. First of all, the work was carried out in the High-Level Technical Group and, in the final stages, took place at political level. The group of European correspondents undertook major preparatory work. On behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks to those who played a part in the positive conclusion of the agreement: in particular, Mrs Frassoni, her colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, and Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg, representatives of Parliament, as well as Commissioner de Palacio, who represented the Commission in the preparation of this work. As for the Council, thanks are due to my predecessors of the Greek and Danish Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement seeks, as set down in paragraph 1, ‘to improve the quality of law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures’, which are detailed in the agreement itself. I would like to point out, Mr President, that, in this agreement, our three institutions commit to ensuring better coordination, better communication and cooperation in carrying out their legislative responsibilities. In it we recognise the importance of greater transparency and accessibility and we are addressing the issue of turning to co-regulation and to self-regulation. We are renewing the commitment to improving the quality of legislation and to establishing procedures for pre-legislative consultation and impact assessment. We would stress the need to improve the transposal of Community law into national legislation. Finally, we are renewing our commitment to simplify and reduce the volume of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, tomorrow, the European Parliament is going to vote on adopting the interinstitutional agreement ‘Better Law-Making’ and the Commission will formalise its approval in subsequent days. To complete the approval procedure, the General Affairs Council will adopt the decision to approve the agreement in next Monday’s session. It will be our task to ensure that the agreement is enforced faithfully and is fully adhered to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I reserve particular thanks for Mrs Frassoni and Mr Medina Ortega.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the three institutions have concluded an interinstitutional agreement on ‘better law-making’. This agreement clearly and broadly commits the three institutions to improving their working methodologies and the quality of law-making by means of a range of initiatives and procedures that it sets out. Consequently, the interinstitutional agreement establishes a solid base for improving the culture of clarity and coherence in drawing up legislative texts and for improving the programming and transparency of the legislative process, whilst respecting the powers and procedures laid down in the Treaties, and the broad principles of democratic legitimacy, subsidiarity and proportionality and legal security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission finds the agreement to be extremely satisfactory. First of all, it is coherent with the proposals we made in the ‘better law-making’ action plan of June 2002. The lines that we then defined are now confirmed. Next, the agreement is well-balanced: it makes frequent references to the Commission’s own commitments but also notes the commitments of Parliament and the Council concerning improving the quality of regulations. In particular, it sets out provisions that complement the proposals contained in the action plan for the programming and transparency of legislative work. The agreement also establishes a definition of a stable framework for using so-called alternative instruments, or <span class="italic">soft law</span>, which are co-regulation and self-regulation. The agreement will allow these instruments to be used and will prevent the multitude of problems encountered in the past when examining this type of measure on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p class="contents">Together with Mr Swoboda, Mr Clegg and Mrs Frassoni, I feel that we must thank the High Level Technical Group which helped us in our work, but I would, of course, also like to mention the contribution made by the politicians to the outcome achieved: an agreement which – although, as Mrs Frassoni said just now, it certainly fails to satisfy everybody in Parliament – I believe is an extremely important compromise, which we must acknowledge this evening in this House. We worked on the basis of the mandate given to us by the Conference of Presidents on 4 July, and I believe I can say that we adhered firmly to this brief and to this will, which, together with the President of the European Parliament, we often witnessed in individual and delegation meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives set down in the mandate concerned adequate guarantees regarding Parliament’s rights as a legislative authority, complete transparency during the legislative procedure and the choice of innovative solutions conducive to more effective and responsible law-making. In short, Parliament’s aim was to enhance democratic legitimacy and the quality of Community legislation, which is something I believe we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the negotiations, the European Commission adopted a series of documents on simplifying and improving legislation, on which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market expressed its opinion by adopting Mr Medina Ortega’s report, which you have just heard presented. The draft interinstitutional agreement reasonably fulfils both the Conference of Presidents’ mandate and the guidelines that are contained in Mr Ortega’s report. Furthermore, although we used the Treaty as a reference – our reference was, of course, the Treaty – the agreement is in line with the draft Constitutional Treaty that was adopted by the Convention and which is being debated in the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention briefly that we have resolved some extremely important issues: the legislative planning, coordination of legislative work between the institutions; the Council informing Parliament on both the annual and the multiannual draft strategic programme; the presence of the Council in committees – in committees as well as in the House, of course – which I feel is important for the exchange of views necessary for Parliament’s work, the Commission commits to participate regularly in the work of the committees, preferably at ministerial level, but, in any case, at the highest level appropriate and at an accountable level. As regards transparency, there is confirmation of the importance of informing the public about the progress of legislative work, as the Convention recognised to some extent; the choice of form for legislative acts, which the Convention also includes in the proportionality principle, while the monopoly of the right of initiative conferred on the Commission – I want to make this clear to Parliament – cannot give it exclusive responsibility for the choice of form for a legislative act. Article 12 lays down that the Commission must take into account recommendations from the other institutions; with regard to co-regulation, on the most sensitive issue of call-back – to which Mrs Frassoni attaches great importance – I would point out that Parliament has already adopted the Wallis report to this end; I believe that we have made great progress in this area, as well as in terms of self-regulation, control and giving economic operators and the social partners the possibility of adopting guidelines in this field; the issue of comitology, impact assessment, timeframes for implementation and transposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot dwell on this any further but I would like to say, in conclusion, that we made sure that the agreement did not jeopardise the future role of Parliament, as Mr Cox has told us at each stage. Not only have we not compromised Parliament’s role, but I believe that we have enhanced the European Parliament – and this is an important fact that remains in this term of office – as a legislative body in the interinstitutional balance of powers and in the interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Legislation must improve and become more transparent, and that is a task for the Commission, Parliament and Member States alike. I believe that the interinstitutional agreement concluded in June is a sign that the Commission, Parliament and the Council are aware of this responsibility. Better legislation is essential for an internal market that functions at its best. Only if citizens and businesses are fully aware of their rights and duties can the internal market function well. European legislation must be readable and not cause any unnecessary red tape. If we as Europe want to become the world's most competitive economy, then we need to ensure at the very least that we can leave behind the unnecessary bureaucracy. It is therefore very gratifying that in 2002, the Commission published a whole series of documents that examine the possibilities of better legislation, but it is important that both the Council and Parliament should remain actively involved in achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements in legislation call for very concrete measures, and so I regret the somewhat vague wording in which the Commission has postulated its policy to improve European legislation. If the European Union does not want to be constantly faced with the need for improving its legislation, it is important for Community law to be given a thorough overhaul from here on in, to ensure that qualitatively sound legislation is introduced. A crucial element in the establishment of better legislation is the analysis of legislation for the financial and administrative implications by means of an impact assessment. Citizens and businesses are still being weighed down by a much too heavy administrative burden. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have called for the introduction of the business impact assessment for a long time. It is, however, important for this impact assessment to be carried out by an independent body. The impact assessment proposed by the Commission, which is to be carried out by the same officials who drafted the legislation, has already prompted me to refer to Baron von Münchhausen, who tried to drag himself out of the swamp by his own hair. As rapporteur for the European impact assessment, I will also certainly opt for an approach that tends towards an independent assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as establishing better legislation, it is at least equally important to determine the alternatives to legislation. Reducing the administrative burden also means placing more emphasis on the use of non-legislative instruments, such as agreements with social partners and self-regulating mechanisms. It is my conviction that these regulations have an important complementary character with regard to existing Community legislation. Apart from carefully examining alternatives for European legislation, it is also important for the implementation of legislation and national legislation by the Member States to be carried out more effectively and monitored closely.</p>
<p class="contents">One remark to finish off; after this plenary debate, the Medina-Ortega Report will be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where it will be adapted to the interinstitutional agreement. I unreservedly endorse this course of action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor is it easy for a parliament to express its willingness to surrender part of its legislative competence. It is relatively easy if this surrender is coupled with a call-back-position, that is, with the right of recall should it become apparent that the implementing or secondary legislation does not reflect the objectives and intentions of the legislator, that is, of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we concentrated on this issue and the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, is one among the many who have pointed out its importance; Mr Medina Ortega, too, has pointed out that, at the end of the day, the Members of this House are elected to pass laws. They are not elected to be spectators or observers at a trial, but to be legislators, and that is what the public expect us to do. We must, however, bear in mind that we do not possess the expert knowledge that some institutions or groups have, and such expertise needs to be used – by which I mean not only the giving of advice, but also having the opportunity to co-determine implementing legislation on the basis of laws passed by this House. I would like, though, to re-emphasise the importance of having the facility of right of recall, and that is something we have achieved. Much in the same way as with self-regulation, it was evident to us from the outset that we neither want nor are able to prevent it, but it must be clear that self-regulation must not nullify this House’s legislative competence, but, as Mrs Frassoni has made very clear, we must be firm in taking action to deal with any threat to curtail our legislative competence. At the end of the day, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, is obliged to take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other things are important, including improvements to the mutual information requirements, and to the information given to the European public. The Commission and the Council took it in turns to put up a great deal of resistance to Parliament’s demands in this area, especially where the call-back position is concerned, but we got our way in the end. The Commission and the Council had probably not reckoned on what I might call an unbeatable team working on this, chaired by Mr Gargani, whose composure was impregnable; Mr Clegg, whose actions were characterised by British reserve, but were nonetheless effective; and Mrs Frassoni, whose combination of toughness and charm was vital in softening up somewhat the Vice-Presidents of the Commission, something that we know is not exactly easy. That being so, I believe that we have come up with a very good solution. I recommend that the House bear this in mind and adopt the Frassoni report accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I much enjoyed working with my colleagues, Mr Gargani, Ms Frassoni, Mr Swoboda and other colleagues in the Council and Parliament, even though it was a painfully protracted process. We arrived at an agreement which is a lot better than many of us expected at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said by a number of speakers, it is not a perfect agreement. No agreement is perfect. It is a bit of a mixed bag. As Monica Frassoni said, there is a bit of 'blah blah'; there are some slightly vacuous passages, but there are also some incredibly important procedural advances.</p>
<p class="contents">For a minute or two I should like to focus, if I may, on what happens next. There is no point in reaching this agreement on paper after all these months of protracted talks if we do not transform the advances we agreed upon into a practical effect as soon as possible. I should like to emphasise two aspects where I think we need to look for follow-up as soon as possible. Firstly, paragraph 36 of the agreement says that 'within six months of the date upon which this Agreement comes into force, the European Parliament and the Council, whose task it would be as legislative authority to adopt at the final stage the proposals for simplified acts, need to modify their working methods by introducing, for example, ad hoc structures with the specific task of simplifying legislation.' That is a very important objective and it will be quite tricky to achieve. I urge both Parliament and our colleagues in the Council to make sure that the deadline of achieving the process of simplification is indeed met within the six months specified here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to refer you to paragraph 30. It deals with something that everyone knows is close to my heart, which is the advance I hope we will make in conducting impact assessments across all three institutions. The text says 'As soon as possible after this Agreement is adopted, the three Institutions will carry out an assessment of their respective experiences and will consider the possibility of establishing a common methodology'.</p>
<p class="contents">Monica Frassoni's commentary on this agreement is absolutely outstanding in its clarity and fairness except in one respect, where I think she is a little negative about the potential of reaching agreement on impact assessments. My own feeling is that there is simply no way that we will achieve the general principles referred to in the common objectives in the agreement - namely legal certainty, the promotion of simplicity, clarity and consistency in the drafting of laws - if we do not make rapid progress – as called for in paragraph 25 – in establishing a common methodology to have environmental, social and economic impact assessments, not only attached to draft proposals from the Commission, but also in significant amendments tabled by ourselves and by the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that there will be some sense of urgency over the next few months to achieve real, practical progress on the back of the agreement, and especially on these two important objectives of simplification and impact assessments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I want to slightly disagree with some of the points that have just been made. When we talk about better legislation, it seems to me that suddenly there descends upon this 21st Century parliament the feel that the late-18th Century Beccaria and Bentham walk the stage with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation is a science which can be improved, because we all know what the good of the human condition is and all we have to do is devise technical means to achieve it. We know, as Mr Medina Ortega has just said, that this is not, in fact, the case. The duties of the members of a democratic legislature are not to seek a single institutional view. The judges of the members of a democratic legislature are to address the dialectic of contemporary politics, to express the points upon which we disagree and not the points upon which we agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of disagreement or debate comes perhaps, in the end, wisdom and decision, but we do not start out on the assumption that there is one right answer and it is a technical question of how to achieve it. Nor can we reasonably start out from the assumption that impact assessment is easy. We have 'legislation missiles' which make impact as they land and through that we can tell what the impact is.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody who has studied the sociology of law is well aware that this is not true. What legislation has actually brought about remains controversial for years after it has been passed. There are many strands in the effects of legislation. We do not even always agree on the juridical impact, far less the economic impact of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A week or so ago, we had a huge argument about the Copyright Directive because people were not sure, not about the cost, but what it would actually mean in its implications before the courts of law. Legal certainty is a myth and an illusion. The most that good legislators can do is diminish legal uncertainty and we should approach our task with due modesty in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me back to the point about subsidiarity which matters to us all greatly. Impact assessment taken on the grand scale seems to suppose that all law impacts equally and in the same way on all parts of this vast and diverse Union. What an absurd view. It is not true. Every time you look at a real case, you find that it impacts differently in different places. This is what makes subsidiarity so important. I strongly commend Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement. I shall vote for it, but I express some doubts about the underlying suppositions of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One improvement to it is to be in the form of an institutional agreement between the three institutions; as for the other, the Commission, starting with the White Paper ‘European Governance’ at the end of 2001, has produced to date no fewer than sixteen comprehensive documents in the form of communications and reports on ‘European Governance and better lawmaking’.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these documents constitute a sort of undertaking on the part of the Commission in respect of its own work, and that is laudable. Others touch directly on Parliament’s rights as laid down in the Treaties, such as, for example, the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, termed comitology procedures, or statements on the creation of new legal instruments, such as, for example, open coordination, self-regulation, co-regulation and similar. The new interinstitutional agreement is meant to be a sort of undertaking on the part of the three institutions to lay down the use of these instruments, which has never before been specified in any of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Although our counterparts have done important work, and despite my gratitude to them for doing so and thus enabling themselves to really get to grips with these issues, I have to say that I am less happy about our entering into another obligation, as anyone reading the text of this interinstitutional agreement could only wonder what added value would thereby accrue to Parliament over and above its rights as laid down in the Treaties. I do not think that will amount to very much; worse still, by signing up to this agreement only a few days after the ceremonial opening of the IGC, which will also deal with this topic, and without being constrained to do so, we in this House are binding ourselves in chains and, indeed, renouncing the full use of the parliamentary prerogatives that it has taken two laborious decades to secure for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way Parliament has, in the past, been able to progressively extend its influence in the teeth of the Commission and the Council has been by making the utmost use of the rights accorded it by the Treaties. By signing up to interinstitutional agreements of this sort and concluding agreements with the Commission, as we did with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are ourselves again curtailing our own rights, thus, as I see it, putting everything completely the wrong way around.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality of European lawmaking is so important an issue that we should not treat it lightly. Those on the receiving end – by which I mean the public to whom legislation applies, the Member States, which have to transpose it and all involved in implementing it at every level – suffer when laws are bad, and so we should stop churning out loads of paper through all the institutions and instead put it to the test by submitting and enacting laws that really are better. That is in our hands as Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the eighth day of October, sees this House, by means of the Medina Ortega report, making a second attempt at stating its position on a Commission communication on simplified and improved regulation dating back to December 2001, since which date, three summit meetings of Heads of State or Government have given their attention to the issue without Parliament having been in a position to respond and thereby make its influence felt. Producing more paper in this way sets a bad example, when we should, instead, be supporting the Commission in reducing the amount of EU legislation, which now amounts to some 97 000 pages, and in cleaning it all up. That, too, would help the quality of European legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, better legislation means European governance that is more democratic, achieves more for its citizens and becomes more comprehensible for everyone – a more efficient, more democratic, more transparent Europe. That was the Convention’s key objective in drafting the constitution. Some Heads of Government were at risk this weekend of slipping back into their old power and money games, thereby, in actual fact, overlooking what the European public actually wants.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, we are able – and this is also topic of discussion here – to do a great deal within the parameters of the European Treaties. In the White Paper on ‘European governance’, the Commission has tabled a large number of proposals for better governance, of which improvements in the legislative process formed an important part. This is an area in which we have made some real progress. The Commission has meanwhile tabled various proposals in this framework, including the programme for consolidation, codification and simplification of legislation, which will reduce the volume of legislation by no fewer than 35 000 pages. This should, for a change, get a mention in the papers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of legislation, however, the co-legislators – Parliament and the Council – should be given a central role. The Commission made an unfortunate start, but later decided on an agreement with Parliament and the Council, which culminated in the interinstitutional agreement. It gives plenty of scope for a swifter, simpler European approach in areas such as environment and social policy. If, however, the results are not satisfactory, Parliament can intervene and claim, and indeed exercise, its right as co-legislator. In my view, the Commission and the Council have been far too slow to concede this, and they are still showing far too little generosity. After all, there is no real democracy without Parliament. Nobody needs a technocratic power governing above and without the European people. What we do need is a drastic approach to tackle excessively lengthy procedures, the lack of results and the overall transparency deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House, Mr van Doorn tabled a proposal for a bureaucracy test of some kind, an independent assessment. I rather like the concept, provided that the information we gain from this eventually ends up with us as co-legislators. In the final analysis, decisions must, of course, be taken by us in unison, together with the Council, and that is, of course, at the heart of the struggle we are having here, so I hope that the Commission is prepared to deliver on the agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a pro-European I find it extremely frustrating that we bring forward legislation in this place that is not properly thought through and that not only damages this Parliament: it also damages our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to look at current legislation to see whether it is being implemented across each Member State. If it is not being implemented, is this because it is unworkable? If it is unworkable, why do we not just repeal that legislation, instead of simply bringing forward further legislation in the same field, as we appear to do at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to look at whether it is really necessary at European level in all cases. If it is necessary then we have to go for comprehensive impact assessment, based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence in some areas where it is applicable, such as health and safety legislation in the employment and social affairs field.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take into account the situation in each Member State. The accuracy of impact assessments really must be improved – I must say that I do not believe that they are very good at the moment. They must also be available at a very early stage so that we can have genuine consultation. That consultation should include the actual instrument which is most appropriate for that specific subject area.</p>
<p class="contents">All the outcomes and all the contributions should be put into the public domain. I am very pleased that Mr Medina Ortega has agreed to refer back his motion. It is right that he should do that. I congratulate him on all the work that he has done but his motion has, of course, been superseded by the interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will involve removing the 'dead wood' – the obsolete or outdated texts – which should result in decreasing the volume of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> without affecting legal status. There is a need to improve presentation and ensure user-friendly access to a Community body of law, the modernisation and simplification of existing legislation and policies have to be phased in.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the task should not be underestimated. The Single Market is one of our great success stories, but the sheer volume of legislation spawned by the Single Market to ensure harmonisation of Member State procedures is daunting. Amendments, originating in any of the official languages and then translated into all of the others, often leave the finished product – when it is translated back into all of the official languages – turgid, pedantic and generally cumbersome and uncomfortable to the native eye. Yes, the legal status is intact, but the text is not user-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our addiction to acronyms has spawned a new language: Eurospeak. After six months in any of the Institutions, we are all using it, further isolating ourselves and our work from 'Joe and Mary Citizen'. Cocobu, CFSP – or is it PESC? – Coreper, and the latest is GARC, which I think stands for the General Affairs and External Relations Council. In short, our texts need urgent detoxification from this addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Impact assessment is a particular area of current interest for my country, Ireland. Our specific interest is in developing a means of competitiveness-proofing for EU legislative measures, to ensure that the EU strategy is one that stimulates economic growth in order to meet the Lisbon 2010 objectives. We would like to achieve real progress in the development and use of impact assessment to underpin competitiveness. The text of paragraph 30 of the interinstitutional agreement is inspired by the proposal in Mr Medina Ortega's report to have the possibility of impact assessments on codecision legislation, prior to the adoption of any substantive amendment, either at first reading or at the conciliation stage on the basis of jointly-defined criteria and procedures. I will not hold my breath, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, the Commission's own integrated impact assessment procedure is in its infancy. For 2003, the Commission identified 44 proposals for so-called extended impact assessment. It seems however, that only four were completed. I should like the Commission to comment on this, please.</p>
<p class="contents">The expected legislative proposals on chemicals not included in the 44 originally identified, but assessed now in response to political and other pressure, will be the first real, extensive impact assessment carried out on a draft proposal. Only then perhaps will its usefulness become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, to use the Commissioner's own words, there is a solid basis here, but perhaps it is a wish-list. Let us hope it is the former.</p>

<p class="contents">Part of this strategy is to simplify and improve law-making. These issues have been monitored for a long time by the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, which is why his rich experience of the lacunae, malfunctions and weaknesses in law-making are crystallised in his report. His proposals cover all stages of law-making, from the preparatory work for legislation, the drafting procedures and how the content is worded, to the stage in which legislation is applied by the Member States. As time is short, I shall comment on three of the basic overall problems which arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is of a purely political nature and concerns the permanent clash between the bureaucracy of each administrative mechanism and, consequently, between the corresponding mechanism of the European Commission, which considers that efficiency is a technical matter, thus undermining the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is the only principle which can lend credibility to any legislative text. If, therefore, we want real reform in law-making, the Commission will need to take suitable initiatives and to set an example which will give absolute priority to democratic legitimacy and to safeguarding the balance between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, from the moment when particular importance is attached, and rightly so in my opinion, to the quality and transparency of the numerous consultations needed to promote a legislative proposal, the minimum consultation specifications proposed should include the representativeness of the social agencies participating by setting strict criteria of representativeness and the procedure for regular revision of the list of representative organisations. Representativeness is not a vested right of any agency and must be confirmed gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the Commission communication, which quite rightly makes proposals on improving how legislative texts are incorporated in the Member States but which, although there are also proposals in the reports relating to the application of the law, does not take account of these proposals. If it at least respected democratic legitimacy, it should be consulting Parliament on why it is not taking account of these proposals.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as colleagues have already commented this evening, these are very important reports because lawmaking is arguably the most important part of government and it defines, in many ways, the fundamental character of any system of governance. I have been in and out of this Parliament now for almost 15 years, and throughout that period there have been reports about the subject matter that we are discussing this evening. What I am not sure about is whether, over that period, legislation has improved or worsened. But I am sure that there is much more political interest in, and debate about, this subject now than there was in my earlier days. That, I am sure, is something of a move in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the proof of the pudding is in the eating - as we say in Britain. It is not what the Commission, or the Council, or the Parliament <span class="italic">say</span> that matters: it is what we <span class="italic">do</span> that counts. What, therefore, are the crucial points?</p>
<p class="contents">The first is, of course, democracy. All procedures for government, whether administration or legislation, must be underpinned by the ballot box. Those who take decisions in these areas must be answerable and accountable for what they do. Finally, the systems in which they work must be transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, all this must take place in the framework of a rule of law. Where abuse occurs, there must be available legal redress administered by an independent judiciary. This can take place in a whole variety of areas: whether there is a failure to transpose, or whether something takes place as a result of improper procedures. To pick up on a point that Mr Medina Ortega made, the areas where self-regulation is in place must in turn operate under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is that frequently banded-about word ‘subsidiarity’. We should not be doing at European level what should in fact be done at a national level, however exactly you define that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly there is proportionality. Any legislation that we draw up must be proportionate to the abuse or the mischief which it is intended to address. In this context, while I commend the proposals of the Mandelkern Report, we must be careful that the impact assessments do not themselves turn into an additional bureaucratic hurdle in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, there is a need for clarity. All I can say is, as an Englishman, that an awful lot of the English that is produced in Brussels is not recognised as such by my fellow countrymen. We should lead by example. Do we actually improve legislation as it passes through this House? I think the truthful answer is that ‘sometimes we do’, when in fact the answer should be ‘always’. We should begin by putting our own house in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the issue I would like to address is what I would call 'horizontal subsidiarity', it is not vertical subsidiarity that Lord Inglewood just addressed in his comments about the level of government - European, national or regional. It is about whether or not you should legislate, whether you should leave it to self-regulation, co-regulation or no regulation at all. There too we need a hierarchy; we need an onus to prove the need to intervene. It may be that you do not need to regulate in certain matters or on certain subjects. If you do, it may be that self-regulation is enough, and if that is not enough, that co-regulation is enough. However, when it is not enough – and only when it is not enough – then we should intervene and adopt legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, as with vertical subsidiarity, who decides? It is right that the legislative authority should decide. Those who are accountable to the population as a whole, rather than to certain sectoral interests, should take that decision in the first place. That is why I welcome the interinstitutional agreement and the Frassoni report – and I congratulate Mrs Frassoni on her report.</p>
<p class="contents">This interinstitutional agreement does not contain an enormous amount, but it does contain recognition that to co-regulate you first need authorisation from the legislative authority. That is a very important principle and is something we have achieved in this interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to add a word about interinstitutional agreements in general. We now have a large number of them, many of them overlap, some repeat the same subjects using different wording. We will soon have to come back and codify and simplify the various interinstitutional agreements that we have into a single, clear, concise text. It is one of the first things we should return to once we have settled the issue, hopefully soon, of adopting our new European Constitution.</p>

I would also like to congratulate the team of negotiators and indeed our rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we get it right, good clear simple legislation could mean fewer infringement cases in the European Court of Justice, it could also result in laws which are easier to enforce in our Member States. I believe that consumers and citizens need to know what redress they can expect from EU law, and businesses need to be clear about standards and practices they must aspire to, in order to implement EU law. Yes, regulatory impact assessments may be a technical tool, but they are a vital tool in both involving more stake-holders and providing for checks and balances on the executive, improving both the quality of debate in this House and our ability to call the executive to account.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also use impact assessments to evaluate the benefits of proposed legislation and equally to look at where co-regulation, self-regulation or soft- law can be useful tools. I know some of my colleagues are concerned that soft-law options would undermine or take away Parliaments prerogative as a legislator. I accept that there are cultural differences between Member States on this issue, but we also have to accept that sometimes legislation can be inflexible and difficult to change whereas codes of conduct can have effect more quickly, particularly in unfair business practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr MacCormick is right that legislation is about politics. It is not just a scientific exercise of impact assessments. For that reason this Parliament and its elected politicians will always be an essential part of the legislative process. I also agree that callback is an essential part of that right of scrutiny. We should give our support to the better legislation agenda but Parliament will need more resources and powers to be able to respond to and evaluate impact assessments and use these regulatory procedures to call Commission and Council to account.</p>
<p class="contents">The better regulation agenda will require a change of culture, power and responsibility in all our institutions. It should not be to the detriment of Parliament; in fact it should strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of future legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I have heard them, and their speeches have confirmed for me that, if we want this agreement not to remain an empty vision, then it will depend exclusively on the European Parliament’s ability to ensure that it is respected and that it enters into the practice of our institution. During this debate, exactly as was the case during the negotiations, we encountered a certain inflexibility on the need to ensure that, where alternative methods to legislation are concerned, there should be a legislator and, for the European Parliament, in particular, the possibility of evaluating how they work and if necessary, of rejecting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McCarthy, the problem is not the cultural difference, which can certainly exist between us regarding voluntary agreements; the problem lies in the fact that, when the voluntary agreements do not work, then we must, as the legislative authority, have the right to recall them, and this, I am sorry to say, is partially possible but only if we fight long and hard to get it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to speak briefly about the issue of impact assessment. Mr Clegg, who was part of our negotiating team, is right: at a certain point, we stopped insisting on this issue, not least because Parliament may well not yet be ready to act united on this question. Impact assessment remains, I would stress, a highly political issue, on which we even risked losing some of our prerogatives during the negotiations, binding ourselves too rigidly to an obligation to complete an impact assessment which, in practice, we are still not technically in a position to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that the Commission’s approach to this issue varies enormously. For some matters, indeed, the assessment is carried out and is seen as important, whilst for other matters it is completely abandoned. In relation to this, I would like to give the example of the famous Van Miert list on trans-European networks, where the Commission has completely abandoned the idea of any type of impact assessment for this important measure. I repeat: impact assessment remains an issue that this interinstitutional agreement has not succeeded in closing, and I think that we must be aware of this act responsibly for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
