<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferri (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this is a proposal for regulations which focuses on a technical point, that is, the obligation to fit a speedometer on so-called minor vehicles, meaning those with two or three wheels and, in certain cases, special ones which have four wheels. Given that today’s measure is optional, it provides an alibi, above all for vehicles which have in some way been souped up and made much faster so that they do not comply with the rules relating to speed and by extension to road safety, which often leads to serious accidents involving young people in particular. The proposal is therefore not purely technical; on the contrary, this small series of rules will become an essential part of everyday life. For this reason, we have put forward proposals and some amendments have been adopted which aim to emphasise how important the subject of road safety is today, not only in individual States, but in a Community context. Moreover, Delors’ White Paper stressed this crucial issue and highlighted the very specific commitment to reducing the number of road accidents within a few years, especially the more serious ones. The nature of this commitment is more moral than legal, and more social than technical. </p>
<p class="contents">We have followed this proposal carefully, especially because our committee which adopted it, wanted to underline how important it is not to tackle road safety according to sectors, but according to a more comprehensive and unitary vision: a true road safety package. On the other hand, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, road safety has become a Community issue. We have overcome all the resistance which often sprang from the conflicting interests of vehicle manufacturers and the European Union and today, finally, we are putting all our efforts into safety in order to safeguard peoples’ lives and health. </p>
<p class="contents">In time, this series of regulations will be subject to amendments, partly because of technological innovations that are the most wide-ranging instruments we can use for protecting people. Now, how can we provide for amending these regulations? This question highlights a problem which is beyond the scope of this small proposal and calls for a more far-reaching proposal – commitology, which Mr Harbour mentioned. This is a focal point, which I invite the Commission, as well as all my colleagues, to reflect on. We have made quite an innovative choice in the sense that by opting for an advisory committee and not a regulatory committee, we are aiming for a certain balance between the Commission and the Council and, by somehow transcending the individual States but without humiliating them, the Commission will retain certain powers of coordination and adaptation, in an outlook which rises above the interests of individual countries that might sometimes mount resistance to such delicate matters.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, from an initial analysis it appears that the Commission is – I will not say indifferent, but rather is in agreement with the Council’s statement. Indeed it is obvious that, when it comes to adapting regulations, each institution tends to feather its own nest. In this case, however, I think – and I would ask the Commission to confirm this – that the Commission and the Council favour a regulatory committee more. </p>
<p class="contents">To be clear, I would like to remind you that this directive already anticipates a deferment to 1 July 2001 for all vehicles, and to 1 July 2002 for mopeds, due to problems of technical adaptation, not to mention the possibility of reaching a conciliation procedure which might postpone the directive’s implementation indefinitely. However, if the Commission undertook to make a horizontal proposal, that is, a more wide-ranging one, which did not only cover the scope of this individual proposal but a whole sector, for example the whole transport sector, and did not wish to extend it to an even more general subject – which however, we will have to do at some point because commitology is an issue which relates to many subjects, and one regulation has already been derogated so we can no longer go back to the former management committee, regulatory committee or advisory committee – therefore, if, in a fairly short time, the Commission took a more comprehensive position, then we could refrain from making this type of proposal. This is obviously my personal position, which should also be evaluated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, because this would naturally represent a broader and therefore stronger objective with respect to the more limited objective. If this does not happen, everyone will follow their own path and it will be up to the institutions to decide democratically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I think that Mr Ferri’s recommendation is a step in the right direction. It stresses the need to guarantee the greatest safety for two- or three-wheel vehicles and, in particular, for mopeds, which are the cause of many deaths among our young people. Speedometers can surely be used to reduce the number of accidents, particularly from the point of view of discouraging speeding. Within the recommendation, we believe that postponing the deadline for transposition could be useful to the industry so that from a technical point of view, it can make adjustments. </p>
<p class="contents">However, with my speech, I want to address a delicate issue of a more general nature, which Mr Ferri has already dealt with, since this recommendation directly tackles one of the most delicate subjects of the interinstitutional report – commitology. Implementing measures for legislation are laid down in the committees, and the importance of this does not escape anyone. These are very important implementing measures which often impact on the legislative text and directly influence the way community legislation is then applied in the Member States. For example, in the specific case of road safety, which is the main subject of the recommendation, we believe that a general policy coordinated by the countries of the European Union should concern everyone, and we would instead like it to be considered to be a necessity rather than a hope, which is the case at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">For this directive, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is proposing an advisory committee which would give the Commission the power to decide on the implementing measures after hearing the opinion of the Member States’ representatives. We members of the Group of the European People’s Party have followed the current debate on which method to use very closely. The Commission’s proposal that was accepted by the Council anticipated type III (a) regulations and was, in our opinion, probably arbitrary. In our view, an advisory committee would have produced greater balance between the institutions. Advisory committees are also the type of committee which Parliament has always preferred. In reference to this, I would remind you of the stances adopted by my colleagues Mr Bourlanges, Mr Di Giovanni and Mrs Aglietta in past parliamentary terms. The idea behind this is the total separation of powers between the legislative and executive bodies and aims to guarantee greater consideration of Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is true that the decision of 28 June constitutes a wide-ranging reform of the committees’ procedures and attributes substantial control to the European Parliament, particularly in the acts adopted under the codecision procedure, regardless of the type of committee. I therefore think that today the procedure is less important to Parliament than it was in the past, but I also think that the Community institutions must adopt a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach in order to respect the interinstitutional balance. Today, we can choose not to give our backing to an advisory committee, provided that the Commission undertakes to put forward as soon as possible a series of proposals to adapt legislation which provide for commitology as their implementing measure, so that we will have a thorough debate which is capable of ensuring coherent decisions in the various sectors of Community competence. We would ask the Commission to put forward a proposal very soon and for it to be available to discuss these choices in the spirit of cooperation it has shown until now. </p>
<p class="contents">I conclude my speech by voicing my total agreement with Mr Ferri, and in this case I think that for the moment we could postpone the advisory committee and so allow the directive to be adopted quickly, given that the Council of Ministers has shown its wish to go to conciliation in the event that such a committee is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But the Council later opened up a Pandora’s box by introducing two supposedly technical amendments: one, to Article 3, which provides for a sort of legislative delegation with continuous reference to the Regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe; and another, to Article 6, extending the time limit for the entry into force of the directive owing to the need for an adaptation period for the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, as a result of these amendments introduced by the Council on the recommendation of the Commission, felt obliged to review the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The time limit seems reasonable, bearing in mind the delay which this directive is experiencing. The deadline for mopeds has been extended from 1 January to 1 July 2002, so that the industry may have a slightly longer adaptation period.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all, the Council has re-addressed the question of commitology. The original decision laid down a certain type of committee, specifically the committee mentioned in Article 3(A) which, in the meantime, was disbanded last July. That committee no longer exists and therefore the rapporteur, displaying a high degree of responsibility and intelligence, has proposed an advisory type committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems inappropriate that in the case of provisions of this type, which the Council describes as technical, the Commission feels set on the idea of a management committee. I hope that the rapporteur maintains his proposal to adopt an advisory committee, which would be most appropriate for this type of regulation. Maintaining the mechanism of a management committee is complicated and, furthermore, it would have to be done by amending the original directive on the type-approval of motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I hope that, on the basis of the agreements which this Parliament adopts this week, the Council and the Commission will consider the possibility of definitively laying down the advisory committee procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being the case, the Liberal Group intends to approve the Ferri report.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, we need to lay great emphasis on the fact that, looking to the future, the European Parliament is going to want to adopt a more comprehensive programme on road safety. We can no longer stand idly by when records show that every year 42,000 people are killed in road traffic accidents in Europe. “Road rage” is on the increase, which ought to make any policy maker aware that there is an urgent need for a number of measures to be drawn up and that these must be implemented in all Member States of the European Union with no concessions being made.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to raise the idea of introducing a monthly traffic “barometer”. This traffic barometer would enable the competent authorities responsible for road safety in the European Union to conduct an evaluation of road safety in the Union on a monthly basis. In this way, the reasons for the lack of road safety could be investigated on a systematic basis and regular consultation would lead not only to action being taken but, most importantly of all, to policy makers becoming sensitive to the needs of road-users.</p>
<p class="contents">Exchanging information and making road-users continuously aware of the enormous responsibility they carry when it comes to road safety will undoubtedly make a huge contribution to substantially reducing personal distress and the grief experienced by families.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Ferri report appeals to young people to be more conscious of road safety. No one doubts that young people must indeed be made aware of the dangers posed by road traffic. However, to my mind it is not just young people whom we need to direct this appeal at. In my view, all road-users, regardless of how old they are, need to be made continuously aware that only if they behave properly and courteously on the roads will it be possible to bring about a reduction in the tragically high number of road traffic victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I was recently in the immediate vicinity when two drivers engaged in fisticuffs, as a result of which one of them died, and all because one was obstructing the other in traffic. These were two adults. When faced with dramas of this kind it makes me realise that we have an enormous problem before us. The Ferri report is a small step in the right direction. I would not wish my colleague Mr Ferri to take this to be a derogatory comment, I just mean to say that we still have a long way to go to reach the goal that we all have before us, notably to make our roads much safer places.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the problem of road safety, particularly for two-wheel motor vehicles, is actually a problem that concerns the younger generation above all. I personally only ride motorcycles and never drive a car. I am also a member of various motorcycle clubs and deal with young people there too. This is why I think it is particularly necessary to do something about this specific area. Of course, speedometers are installed in order to automatically create an inhibiting threshold to the vehicle’s speed because otherwise – unfortunately this is the case – very high speeds are attained which these vehicles cannot cope with on account of their centre of gravity being too high, for example. This has dire consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we fully endorse this directive, and we would also be pleased, of course, if, all in all, more could be done in the European Parliament with regard to road safety so that it is more consistent between Member States, because the accident figures clearly show that young people are the ones most affected in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">We agree that the deadline should be postponed. We must also give industry the chance to actually transpose it if, at the end of the day, that then helps us to achieve a uniform directive. We also believe that an advisory committee would be the appropriate instrument for this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to commend Mr Ferri on his report and, in particular, his emphasis on the road safety aspects. My concern is that I believe these aspects are so important that I certainly would not like to see this directive held up because of arguments over commitology. It seems to me that this directive is too important for that. I know Mr Ferri feels very strongly about commitology but it seems to me there are much broader issues. This links in with my own report, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear from Mr Ferri’s analysis that we are talking in terms of motor vehicle legislation not just at a European level, but at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe level which has, for many years now, been accepted within the motor vehicle industry as setting a whole range of global standards. Increasingly we are entering into dialogue with the United States and Japan about global technical standards for motor vehicles. Indeed in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, of which I am also a member, we will shortly be considering a report on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that to just look at the commitology aspect of this particular directive now and to hold up this measure is not the right way of proceeding. We have to think about how we are going to address the whole issue of considering and approving global technical regulations and the European Union’s input into them. This is something we really need to ask the Commission to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consider our own approach. It is quite clear, looking around here this evening, that there is not an overwhelming interest in these technical directives among Members of the European Parliament. There are some enthusiasts here with an interest in addressing these issues and we have to think about ways in which we can have an input into these technical processes. We must let the Member States and the Commission make their proposals and then look at some of the key initiatives and put forward the point of view of the citizens, the businesses, the road-users and drivers across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we have got that balance right. We need the safety benefits of Mr Ferri’s directive but we also need to take a much broader look at how to handle the move towards global technical standards in a crucial industry for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission believes that, for reasons of safety and to protect the environment, mopeds and motorcycles that are not fitted with a type-approved speedometer should no longer be allowed to be placed on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be possible at all times for drivers of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles to comply with the speed limits in force in the Member States. They should not have the opportunity to refer to the lack of legal provisions in order to escape the consequences of breaking the speed limit. Besides, the speedometer is already a standard fitting in most of the vehicles placed on the market in the European Union, without this significantly affecting the overall price of the vehicle. In addition, the compulsory fitting of a speedometer in all these vehicles will yield economies of scale which will benefit consumers as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would be prepared to approve all the proposed amendments, but Amendment No 5 on the committee procedure may prove very problematic. As the Commission will soon be making a proposal to amend the framework directive, i.e. the Directive establishing a committee on motor vehicles, the Commission suggests that the committee procedure be discussed in that connection. The issue could also be dealt with when the new commitology decision approved in June enters into force with regard to the existing committees. However, I would consider it unfortunate if discussion of the document became a matter for conciliation simply because of a problem concerning committee procedure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
