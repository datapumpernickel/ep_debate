<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, my one-minute allocation in the previous debate did not give me enough time to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for the work she did and the manner in which she did that work. I would suggest that the subject of this report also illustrates the need for reform of the common fisheries policy. In other words, if we had a successful fisheries management system in the European Union, then perhaps we would not need emergency measures to safeguard declining stocks in this fashion. But we do. These plans seek to restore stocks of cod and hake to sustainable levels. But they also have socio-economic implications, not only for those who fish cod and hake, but also for fishermen whose livelihood depends on stocks associated with either of these fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">This report emphasises, therefore, a number of key concerns: there should be no broad-brush approach; there must be accurate scientific advice, the impact of industrial fisheries must be recognised; there must be adequate funding; and accessible diversification programmes should be available. The Commission itself admits that it has not relied solely on scientific advice and that there is a general lack of scientific advice for assessing long-term recovery plans. The Commission's own words are telling. I remain unconvinced that scientific advice is sound enough to earn the confidence of the fishermen affected by these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the major problem of scientific advice is black landings. I have no doubt that so-called black fish landings do have a negative impact on statistics. But that points to inherent flaws in the current management system. Surely discards are a bigger problem, perhaps the major impact? The report therefore stresses the importance of properly funded and precise scientific advice. It also calls for the idea of observers to be extended to ensure that scientists observe actively on fishing vessels. This should also help to instil confidence in technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission states that with regard to the North Sea closures of last spring it was aware that the effort displaced from the area closed to protect cod would create increased pressure on other stocks. The Commission does not, however, address the extent to which this impact could have proven disastrous, had it not been for the responsible action of Scottish fishermen, for example, who voluntarily tied up at their own cost. I put it to the Commission that the issue of displaced fishing effort was not properly thought through and that potential displacement must be properly assessed in future closures, with the benefits of closure balanced against the detrimental knock-on effects.</p>
<p class="contents">In welcoming the commitment to tie-up schemes by the Commission, I note that it is not only encouraging compensated tie-up, but also removing the current ceilings on financial contributions. I am deeply concerned, though, that funding is not applied equitably amongst fishermen affected by such measures. If fishermen are willing to take responsible action themselves, when going to sea could risk further stock decimation, there must be some mechanism that allows them to do so without going bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly urge Members to support both the amendments in the vote today. The first asks the Commission not to neglect the specific needs of mixed fisheries, whilst the second calls for measures to encourage environmentally-friendly and smaller-scale fisheries. Finally, I also call for the deletion of paragraph 7, which not only is an open attack on small-scale fisheries, but also a ringing endorsement of the promotion of large-scale industrial fisheries which, I contend, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have to strike a balance here between the need to advance the recovery of stocks and the need to avoid disproportionate restrictions on the many different fisheries affected and the resultant negative consequences for those whose livelihood depends on the sea. To this end I call on the Commission to take on board the recommendations of this report and to ensure that the fishing industry and scientists are fully involved. In this respect would it not make sense to bring about the early introduction of zonal management committees and allow them to take forward recovery plans in a proactive rather than a reactive way? I hope that this afternoon Members will support this report and its amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my earlier speech I was unable to take the time to do so. I should like to wish the Commissioner well. We could perhaps have a cheap go at him this morning for not being here but, if he is not well, we wish him a speedy recovery. Unlike Mr Cunha I cannot offer him a remedy for a speedy recovery, but a hot Irish whiskey is not bad for the flu either.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that this report addresses many current concerns in the fisheries sector and certainly rebuilding the stocks of cod and hake is going to be a tremendous challenge. We have to face the reality that this is going to be extremely difficult to achieve. That is the one thing that we have learned recently. But the truth is that it has to be achieved if we want to maintain stocks in our seas. We have to do everything the rapporteur has outlined: increase net size, bring in square mesh panels and recognise, above all, that we must face up to the problems created by discards. This is something that has not been faced up to. We have paid lip service to it but have not been able to resolve the problem. Protection of juveniles is equally important and must be one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must have improved scientific information: there can be no broad-brush approach, as has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">In my area in the Irish Sea we now face, for the third year running, the closure of the fishing area for six weeks. There is greater willingness among fishermen to cooperate with the authorities and the European Union to achieve the recovery of stocks. I have to ask the Commission one question: does it really feel in all honesty that it has responded to the fishermen in this area? I have to say that it cannot bring in closures and tie-ups to help recovery without compensation, as this will not work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the Commission that it is not myself, the rapporteur or any Members in this House with an interest in fisheries, but rather the fishermen who are out there working, trying to make a living and trying to survive in very difficult circumstances who need convincing of the need for this. The Commission will not obtain their cooperation unless they are given the support they require. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, there is no consensus amongst scientists on the effectiveness of these measures, and this means that, while we share the objectives, we nevertheless doubt their effectiveness. The opinion of the Scientific Committee, for example, says that a more drawn-out recovery plan which involves less sacrifice for the fleet is a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Hake and cod are two highly valued species on the Community market, resources of which have been drastically reduced as a result of over-fishing. But not only by over-fishing of these two species, but also of other associated species, which are part of the food chain and which have reduced sources of food for hake and cod, thereby affecting the conservation of those stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">These preservation measures, which are being presented to us today, imply a forced reduction of the fleet’s activity and taking a part of it out of service, and the Community is therefore obliged to maintain an aid policy which is able to alleviate these negative effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Long may this continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the rebuilding of cod and hake stocks is a critical issue for those involved in the industry in Scotland. I would like to pay particular attention to the issue of cod. Scientific advice for many years has been stark. It tells us that various stocks are so far outside safe biological limits that major initiatives are now urgently required to stabilise the decline. Thus some form of action must be taken as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the proposal that fishing effort should be reduced by up to 40 to 50%. This is ambitious and begs thorough consideration, working alongside all other Member States. Elements of fleet reduction are being achieved through decommissioning of vessels. In Scotland the Labour-led coalition has committed over GBP 25 million to such a decommissioning scheme. In fact, the first boats began decommissioning last week.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, additional technical measures have been introduced to improve the selectivity of gear. Thirdly, new monitoring measures have been proposed. The issue of closed areas and possible real-time closures have also been considered and, in some cases, introduced in order to allow for the regeneration of stocks. The need for action on cod recovery is paramount if there is to be a cod fishery at all. We need only look at Newfoundland and Canada to see the consequences of overfishing. Even today the cod have not returned.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are other factors at play. Global warming and the linked heating of our oceans are also considerations. We should never forget the key link between the environmental decisions that we make in this House and the consequences that these have for the sustainability of our seas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, all stakeholders, the European institutions, Member State governments and the fishing industry must be involved if any of these measures are to be successful. An effective stock recovery programme is essential for the future of cod fisheries in Scotland and the UK. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
