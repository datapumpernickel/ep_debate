As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure for the 1999 financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report follows the format used for the past two years with chapters covering revenue in each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the Financial Perspective. You will also find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance, and attached to the report you will find the Court's observations on implementation of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The different chapters of the annual report address four main concerns. Firstly, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation of the budgetary management practices within the specific financial headings. You will find that the Court has paid more attention to the follow-up to previous observations, in response to the demands expressed by this Parliament. In each of the chapters the Court reports on the progress made in a number of areas on which it had reported in the past and I will return to some of these issues in my presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in response to the request of the European Parliament, the Court has expanded its audit work on the Statement of Assurance and now provides additional information per area of expenditure in each chapter. Finally, in each of the chapters the Court presents a number of other key audit findings. Many of these findings are also reported upon in more detail in the Court's special reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the last discharge procedure the Court has adopted 24 special reports containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community's financial management can be improved. Although these reports are not part of today's presentation, they are to be taken into account in the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The total income for the 1999 financial year amounted to EUR 86.9 billion. The gross national product-based resources represent 43% of this total. The value added tax-based resources represent 36% and the traditional own resources are 15% of the total. The remaining 5% is composed of the surplus resources of the previous year and other income. This means that four fifths of the Community resources, the gross national product plus the value added tax-based resources, are calculated and fixed by using statistical data.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out two major observations of the Court in this context. First, for several years now, the Court has commented on the use of a statistical aggregated system (SEC79), which for all other purposes has already been replaced by a newer system (SEC95). The difference is 16 years. Further, in the context of the fight against VAT fraud, the Court has identified a method based on a comparison between fiscal and statistical intermediate consumption data that can be particularly useful in pointing to areas where the risk of fiscal fraud is high. It therefore invites the Member States to consider the use of this method.</p>
<p class="contents">In the customs area the Court reports on the complexity and variable application of the outward processing procedure. However, it also supports the Commission's proposal to modernise customs arrangements with an economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 1999 expenditure, a total amount of EUR 93.6 billion was entered into the account as new commitments, and payments amounting to EUR 80.3 billion were recorded. This is 96% and 92% respectively of the available appropriations for the year. The utilisation rates of the Financial Perspective estimates are 91% and 83% respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Expenditure from the Community budget is spread over many different areas. It is, therefore, difficult to draw general conclusions on this budgetary implementation. However, the Court makes the following major points. Half of the 1999 expenses are recorded under the common agricultural policy. As reported in chapter 2 of this annual report, the high rate of expenditure, which is almost 99% of final appropriations, is explained in part by numerous transfers that reflect in fact the poor quality of the initial estimates, of both revenue and expenditure. The Court invites both the Commission and the Member States to improve the quality of these estimates.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also numerous transfers of appropriations for the Structural Funds that significantly altered the structure of the 1999 budget. Further, there were major differences between programme amounts and the amounts allocated by the Financial Perspective and the majority of Structural Fund interventions had to be rescheduled. In this area there was also an under-utilisation of commitment and payment appropriations and a concentration of transactions at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">In areas where the Community programmes are implemented directly by the Commission, such as internal policy and external actions, implementation rates are somewhat lower. There is also a heavy concentration of commitments and payments at the end of the year. This is something that we have come back to over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court repeats, consequently, its comments of previous years on the negative effects of this, for instance poor and hasty decisions, heavy workload creating a risk of errors and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in both the chapters on internal policies and external actions, the Court finds that the Commission's own comments on budgetary implementation are inadequate. The Court welcomes, therefore, the clear commitment of the Commission's answer to improve fundamentally its budgetary and accounting report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has produced an annual Statement of Assurance since the 1994 budgetary year. Each year the Court has expressed serious criticism of the legality and regularity of the payments and the transactions underlying them. This is the case once again. Indeed, the audit of the 1999 payments revealed once again an unacceptable incidence of error which affected their amount or the reality or the eligibility of the transactions underlying them.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of these errors occurred in areas of the Community budget that are managed by the authorities in the Member States. They mainly comprise non-compliance with eligibility rules, overclaims, insufficient justification and calculation errors.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other failures to comply with regulations and systems weaknesses for which the effects on payments cannot be directly evaluated but which increase the risks of errors occurring. The most frequent examples here are problems in implementing regulatory control checks insufficiently, detailed supporting documentation and failure to comply with tender procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, for 1999, the Court did not obtain the necessary evidence from its audit activities to ensure that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, except for own resources, commitments and administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, for the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Fund, the Court gives a positive statement of assurance. Not only is it the duty of the Court to report on the errors found in its audits but we should also ensure that our audit findings are interpreted and used correctly. Therefore, let me remind Members of Parliament that the high incidence of errors found by the Court cannot, and must not, be seen as an indication of the level of fraud affecting the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the payment errors found by the Court are due to problems of inadequate financial management and control and it is only in the case of a small proportion of the errors found that further reinvestigation by OLAF or the Member States' authorities is justified. Another risk of misrepresentation is that the objectives for corrective actions are set in terms of diminishing error rates and obtaining a positive statement of assurance. As the Court already pointed out in its previous report, a medium-term improvement requires a combination of general and specific measures, including the clarification and improvement of control procedures, particularly at the level of Member States. In this context, the Court welcomes the Commission's plan for improving financial management presented to the discharge authority in the context of the discharge for 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">This reflection leads me to some comments on the reform of the Commission. The Court welcomes the efforts of the Prodi Commission to build a modern and robust structure of management and control and, at the same time, to focus on the way political priorities are set and resources allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the weaknesses that the Commission now seeks to overcome have been emphasised by the Court on many occasions. For instance, the proposals of the Commission to increase the responsibility of authorising officers for the execution of commitments and payments while bringing to an end the centralised system of prior approval of transactions by the financial controller, together with the creation of an independent internal audit service, is in line with the key requirement for improved financial management that we lay down in our Opinion No 4/97.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element of the reform that corresponds closely to a key priority identified by the Court is the increased focus to be placed on results and performance measurement within a framework of resource allocation that is consistent with predetermined priorities and objectives that are clearly defined and measurable.</p>
<p class="contents">At sector level, the Commission has now announced reform programmes which can be seen as a response to concerns expressed by the Court over a number of years, for example, the proposals for improving the management of external aid programmes. This initiative is clearly based on an analysis very similar to that of the Court – most comprehensively set out in its Annual Report for 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the Court encourages the Commission to proceed from principles to practice as quickly as is feasible, it needs to be recalled that, as yet, much of the reform is still on paper only. The implementation of this new reform will need a genuine change of the management culture of the Commission, a process that will certainly take time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Report 1999, when reporting upon the follow-up of previous observations, shows how difficult it is for the Commission to implement the needed changes which have been agreed upon. In some cases, such as the reforms of the measures for the subsidised use of skimmed milk and skimmed milk powder or the programme of assistance to South Africa, as well as in certain areas of traditional own resources, the Commission has taken actions to remedy specific weaknesses reported upon by the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas corrective action has been slow. For instance, for the milk quota system, the Court found that the overall situation had not significantly changed and that, contrary to the Court's view, increased quotas have been established, thereby giving rise to greater surpluses in the milk market and a heavy financial burden for public storage and disposal measures. In the case of the import of dairy products at preferential rates, the Court considers that nothing has been done so far to avoid breaches of regulations similar to those reported in the Court's Special Report No 4/98.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of the European Regional Development Fund, the Court followed up about 48 observations for which it believed a financial correction should be made. There are only 16 cases where the Court is satisfied with the corrective measures taken by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of the social dialogue, the Commission has not undertaken all the measures it had agreed to carry out in its replies to the Court's observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the internal policies area, the Court re-audited nine contracts at the Transport and Energy Directorates-General and eight contracts at the Research Directorate-General. The Commission had only followed up three of the 17 contracts, with actions continuing on six others.</p>
<p class="contents">In its 1996 annual report, the Court identified a number of weaknesses in the management of an export promotion fund for Nicaragua and Honduras. In its discharge recommendation published in 1998 the Council called on the Commission to review its relations with the regional bank and recover amounts unduly credited by this bank. At the end of 1999, the Commission was still in the process of setting up a new organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">From these and other examples, it is clear that the Commission has hitherto not only been slow in implementing corrective measures but that it particularly faces problems when it comes to recovering unduly paid amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">In its 2001 programme, the Court has therefore planned an overall audit covering all budgetary areas of the Commission's recovery procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As I indicated before, the Commission's financial management is only part of the overall management of Community funds. Member States are responsible for the day-to-day management of the bulk of Community funds in the areas of the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. This annual report and the special reports published since the last discharge continue to draw attention to serious and persistent weaknesses in Member States' management and control systems. For instance, an important category of errors reported in the Statement of Assurance are irregular deductions by the central or local administrations on agricultural subsidies. Also in the area of the common agricultural policy, the Court calls upon Member States and the Commission to make checks more effectively by comprehensively applying to all Common Market Organisations inspection procedures comparable to those of the Integrated Administrative and Control System.</p>
<p class="contents">The dramatic events of the recent past have clearly demonstrated the increasing importance of management and control issues on the European agenda. It should be clear to each and every one of us, whether as representatives of European institutions or of Member States, that this reflects a permanent change in the values and opinions of European taxpayers. They require, in exchange for their confidence and contribution, that the European funds are being spent in a meaningful and honest way.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment undertaken by the Commission should be seen as a constructive reply to this challenge: a reply that deserves our support. On the other hand, the Commission will be aware that it has now raised high expectations and that it is obliged to put into practice its good intentions and to produce results.</p>
<p class="contents">It rests with the budgetary authorities, which have successfully triggered the reform that addresses public financial management concerns, to continue and reinforce their efforts to ensure that this reform succeeds. In practice, they will thus have to devote sufficient attention and resources to the follow-up to, and the feedback from, the reform process. Members of the European Parliament will be at the forefront of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The new President of the Italian Court of Auditors, the <span class="italic">Corte dei Conti</span>, who was officially installed in office a few weeks ago, said in his instalment address: "I am convinced that the relations between the Court of Auditors and Parliament would be significantly improved if Parliament strengthened the instruments that are designed to ensure that Parliament systematically takes results of audits carried out by the Court of Auditors into consideration".</p>
<p class="contents">I make his words mine. They imply that we wish to see a development of the working organisation and methods of this Parliament to reflect this need for structural change. Yesterday I had the opportunity – for which I thank the President – to discuss with the President of Parliament involving all the committees of this Parliament in the business of financial and management control.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, we will also need the cooperation of the Member States. Being responsible for the day-to-day management of the bulk of Community funds, the Member States need to strengthen their financial controls and to take up fully their responsibilities in the fight against fraud against the Community budget. Only when all actors – the Commission, Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Auditors and the Member States – commit themselves to the reform and cooperate in this achievement will the confidence of the European taxpayer in Community financing be able to be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. </span>–<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is heading in the right direction, but it still has a long way to go. That is the European Court of Auditors' message to the Commission. This message became very clear in your speech just now, Mr Karlsson. The Court of Auditors quite rightly applies very high standards to the way tax-payers' money is used, and the Commission is following these high standards in its own financial management reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors is giving the Commission's reform a fair wind. That is to be welcomed and I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Karlsson, and also the Members of the Court of Auditors and its officials, for supporting the reform of the Commission in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">In its annual report for 1999, the Court concluded that too many errors had occurred in implementing the budget to give a positive statement of assurance. On the other hand, the Commission's accounting procedures are declared to be reliable, and the legality and regularity of the revenue side of the budget, of commitment appropriations and of staff expenditure are confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, during the debate and throughout the whole discharge process we will probably focus on implementation of the budget, that is on the payment and reconciliation of appropriations. The Court has once again stressed that over 80% of European budget resources are administered by the Member States. If I pick that point up here it is by no means because the Commission wants to hide behind the Member States when it comes to accepting political responsibility. By no means – the European Commission bears political responsibility for budgetary implementation in accordance with the EC Treaty. If the Member States, however, for their part, use this treaty provision as a kind of protective shield, and they hide behind it instead of taking the necessary measures, than that simply is not acceptable either.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly do not want to make sweeping generalisations. For example, joint measures have been taken to improve controls as regards financial protocols relating to the Structural Funds and financial corrections in the case of agricultural expenditure. But I find it really amazing that some Member States can refuse to accept financial responsibility, for example, in the area of customs duties, when their own authorities have made mistakes which mean that customs duties cannot be entered and they then refuse to make good this shortfall in revenue, so that instead all the Member States have to accept joint responsibility for this revenue shortfall. This means that conscientious Member States are financially penalised and less conscientious ones are financially rewarded. Such a distorted system of initiatives should be enough to make any finance minister's stomach turn, but at present it seems that only the Commission finds it disturbing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors also makes it clear in its report that the errors identified by the Court do not amount to fraud, nor are they detrimental to the budget. I am not mentioning this with a view to exoneration, but rather to clarify matters. It is, of course, emphasised that it is the European Commission's job both to avoid formal errors and to combat fraud, especially as people keep asking where the dividing lines lie and where things blend together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore attributes the highest priority to imposing tighter controls so as to protect the European tax-payer and the EU budget. The recently published annual report on protecting the financial interests of the Community and the annual report on fraud prevention demonstrate this. OLAF was set up in 1999. New measures have been taken to prevent fraud in procurement, which is a very important area. Legislation has now been proposed to prevent money laundering and to combat counterfeiting of the euro. Cooperation agreements with third countries and, in particular, with candidate countries have been framed more strictly so that anti-fraud measures do not stop at the EU's borders. And last but not least, the complaint the Commission has brought against the tobacco companies in the American courts on the grounds of alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling has made it clear that when it comes to fighting fraud, the Commission is not afraid of taking on the giants. In view of the timing of this, I would also like to mention in this connection that we have presented a proposal for the Nice Intergovernmental Conference to amend the EC Treaty to allow a European Public Prosecutor's Office to be created to prosecute fraud detrimental to the Community's financial interests. I very much hope that this proposal to the Nice Intergovernmental Conference will not just be shelved or swept under the carpet, but that it will be given serious attention.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in a spirit of "we want our money back", it is, of course, also a question of making financial corrections and securing recovery of overpayments here today. Mr President of the Court of Auditors, I for one warmly welcome the fact that you have announced your intention to prepare a special report, to carry out a special audit on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, about EUR 600 million of financial corrections are made in relation to the common agricultural policy and, for example, about 2% of areas eligible for aid are not paid any subsidies as a sanction against incorrect area information frequently being given. This is a problem area that the Court of Auditors also very clearly indicated in its annual report for 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors is increasingly making use of special reports. I would like to welcome this trend on behalf of the Commission, as these special reports are very topical and can therefore also be valuable in making up-to-the-minute decisions. Please note I said "can be". Because it is often not enough for the Commission to simply listen to what the Court of Auditors has to say, because the Council and Parliament are also involved. By way of a specific example, I have in mind the special report that has just been published on the market organisation for sugar. The Commission has suggested that the present COM should only be extended by two years, after which it will be thoroughly revised. Unfortunately, the Council believes that this is too early, and that it should be extended for longer. I think this goes to show that the comments the Court of Auditors makes on the basis of an examination of historical facts and the valuable hints it can give about how to proceed in future also subsequently need to be debated with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, up-to-the-minute conclusions need to be drawn from up-to-the-minute audit reports. That applied to food aid for Russia, for example, which the Court audited in one report. When it became apparent at the end of last year that the original humanitarian aid objectives could not be achieved without disproportionate expenditure on control and monitoring measures, the Commission decided to terminate this action although funds were still available.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would also like to briefly mention that foreign policy aid as a whole is an important area of the Commission's work, both as regards institutional reform of this entire area and also given that the high historical liabilities in this sphere need to be worked through more quickly and to a greater extent than in the past. The Commission has presented a paper on this to the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is on the right path with its reforms. However, not only are we heading in the right direction, we have also already covered a significant part of the ground. One of the milestones we have already passed is the 2001 budget, which the Commission has, for the first time, presented using activity-based budgeting. Within the "Peer Group", the Commission has reordered its priorities and has accordingly reorganised its personnel allocation. The Commission has strengthened the audit capacity of the individual Directorates-General. It has also set up an internal audit service which will monitor the control systems in individual departments as well as creating a central financial service which all the Directorates-General can use, for instance when they are drawing up contracts or when they need help in implementing the provisions of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are now coming to a difficult stretch, where we need the support of the European Parliament, the Council and also the Court of Auditors. This applies, for example, to the amendment of the disciplinary procedure, but it also applies in particular to the revision of the Financial Regulation. Mr President, you said that much of the reform is still only on paper. Of course, it is now a matter of implementing it. For example, the Court of Auditors has committed itself to giving its opinion on the proposal for the revision of the Financial Regulation as quickly as possible, and I am very grateful for that. I hope that Parliament and the Council will be infected by the Court of Auditors' ambitious approach, so that this milestone for reform will very soon not just be a proposal on paper but legislation in force for improving budgetary management.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control. </span>–<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Karlsson very sincerely for his presentation on the annual report. Mrs Schreyer's report was just as interesting. But I would particularly like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as President of the Court of Auditors, for the way you have kept the Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control informed this time round. This has enabled us to prepare for today's debate without having to obtain details from the press.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Mr Karlsson, 1999 was a dramatic year, with the resignation of the previous Commission and the appointment of the new one. We do not expect that the new Commission will immediately be able to rectify all the mistakes and irregularities that Parliament uncovered and because of which it called, in vain, for reforms at that time. Like the Court of Auditors, we welcome President Prodi's efforts to reform the Commission and we are following the implementation of these efforts in a constructive but not uncritical way.</p>
<p class="contents">Are things finally changing for the better as regards the Community budget? We would have liked to have been able to say "yes" to that question, now that the new Commission has been in office for over a year and has, since September 1999, already been directly responsible for part of the process of implementing the 1999 budget. Unfortunately, we cannot yet answer with a clear conscience, even armed with the Court of Auditors' new annual report. The Court of Auditors has quite rightly noted the many steps that the new Commission has taken – or at least announced – in order to improve matters. Mrs Schreyer also mentioned this. I have in mind new procedures for setting priorities and allocating resources, changes in human resources policy, fundamental improvements in budget implementation and financial control, reform of programmes and the creation of an efficient audit service. But all these are still hopes for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality as described in the annual report is, however, more sobering. What is particularly regrettable and almost incomprehensible is that there are still problems about the reliability of accounting procedures. In other words, the Commission has not put its books in order, and the closures only reflect the true financial position subject to serious limitations. Information is missing on the payment of advances and the payment of instalments at the year end, and existing commitments are, believe it or not, undervalued by EUR 2.6 million. At the same time, the Court of Auditors says that potential claims have been significantly overvalued. Parliament expressly drew attention to these serious accounting errors during the discharge procedures for 1996, 1997 and 1998. Even if it is difficult and time consuming to fundamentally change budget management, we might have hoped, Commissioner, that the new Commission would at least manage to get the books straight without delay. But it is apparent that they have not even succeeded in doing that, which is a matter of great regret as far as I am concerned. When you assumed office, Mrs Schreyer, you assured us that you would strive to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year, in January, it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors. You are familiar with the wording of that decision. But if there is no closure, that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management, just as we said back in January. Closure is a condition for such a discharge. A solution needs to be found here, and I would like to ask you, Mrs Schreyer, if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, and for the sixth successive time now, the Court is unable to give a positive statement of assurance, that is to say, it cannot give a guarantee of the legality and regularity of the procedures on which the financial statement is based. The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given. The error rate is still well over 5%. Expressed in euros, that means that a sum of approximately EUR 5 billion was spent incorrectly. I most certainly recognise that fraud is not always involved, Mr Karlsson. It is often a case of carelessness or misunderstandings in the face of complicated rules and procedures, but there is no getting round it: an error rate this high is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">I must refute your comments about poor implementation in the Member States, Mrs Schreyer, given that the Court of Auditors was quite clear about where the error rate lay within the Commission and, ultimately, it is still the Commission that bears responsibility for budget implementation. I would like to see more rigour here, so that we can really tell the European public that their money is being properly administered. We are now getting down to work in committee and will cooperate closely with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blak (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, I should first of all like to thank the Court of Auditors for its annual report. I should like to draw attention to a number of problems, and I hope that Mr Karlsson will be able to answer my questions today. In connection with the 1997 discharge, we in Parliament agreed that, as Mrs Theato has just said, no discharge for 1999 could be given if the Court of Auditors was not in a position to issue a positive statement for 1999. However, I should like to know how serious the situation is regarding the 1999 accounts. Yesterday, I asked you a question – I appreciate there was not much time – but I should like to have a completely clear answer from you to the question of how great a percentage of error there is. We are told that this cannot be properly calculated. Yesterday, a member of the Court of Auditors gave a press conference and, at this press conference, a figure was given, and so I think we should be given one here, too. Is the percentage of error 5.5? I hope I can obtain an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission employed more than EUR 80 billion in 1999. However, the Commission has not been especially good at administering the Budget. The amount of fixed assets has been set EUR 240 million too low. Liabilities have been set EUR 2.6 billion too low, and unredeemed liabilities have been set EUR 1.2 billion too high. If the management of a private firm had committed such major blunders, then I am almost certain that the owners would have given them the sack. But let us pour a little oil on the waters now, so that we do not get ourselves worked up at this early stage. The former Commission, which was primarily responsible for the 1999 Budget, was indeed given the sack. The new Commission is to be judged this year on how good it has been at cleaning up and implementing reform. I am therefore pleased that the Court is attaching more importance to following up the earlier annual reports. This emerges clearly, of course, wherever there are still problems, but also where some sound improvements have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I could have done with seeing a much more practical annual report from the Court of Auditors. We must have more figures, and we must have more facts. Mr Karlsson said yesterday that it is not easy to come up with figures. I appreciate this, but I asked one of my employees to look at the agricultural section, and in an hour he had prepared a complete report on which countries were concerned, on what problems there were and also on how much money had gone missing. If this can be done in an hour by an able employee here in Parliament, then we can probably also demand that the Court of Auditors issue a report of this kind on all sections. Some unpalatable facts will emerge of course but, at the same time, we are demonstrating that transparency exists. In that way, we can shut the press up, which is merciless and scents blood every year when the Court of Auditors produces its report. Once and for all, we can say: ‘Here are the problem areas, and we want to find solutions’. I believe this is a good way of doing that, and I also think that the report should be much more practical.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also have liked the Court of Auditors’ report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter. I could also do with seeing the Court of Auditors produce its report earlier in the year. It would give us more time for the discharge procedure in Parliament, and we should not need to defer the discharge every single year. As rapporteur, I now have only 14 days in which to ask the Commission questions, and in 14 days it has to supply me with the answers. It is almost unreasonable to make such demands, so if we could obtain the report much earlier, we could also produce a piece of work of even higher quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Court emphasises that the 7% margin of error does not only relate to fraud, and I hope that the press is listening hard in the press room so that it is not only the scandals that are reported. There may be irregularities or ambiguities. What is really a relief is that it looks as though the right way to combat fraud has been embarked upon. Only very few cases have been referred to OLAF and for criminal investigation in the Member States, but it is important to remember that, as Mrs Theato also mentioned, 7% of the Budget corresponds to DKK 5 to 6 billion. If it comes down to figures, that amount is larger than the whole of the EU’s development aid. Reform of the Commission is largely about making the individual Directorates-General responsible, and I should like to ask the Court whether it has plans in future to restructure the annual report so that chapters for the individual Directorates-General are prepared. I shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can make a start on assessing the Directorates-General. We can also make a start on assessing the Commissioners and giving them marks according to how good they are. They could perhaps be given a push in the right direction, if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors emphasises once again that daily administration of most EU resources, for example within agriculture and the structural sphere, takes place in the Member States, and I completely agree with what has been said to the effect that the Member States now need to make sure they get their act together. The Member States avoid responsibility, misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and, every time criticisms are made, a storm of criticism rains down upon those in Brussels, that is to say the Commission and others. I think the Member States should be ashamed of themselves. In 1995, a convention to protect the EU’s economic interests was adopted. There is only one Member State which has implemented this in its legislation. It is simply not good enough, so make sure you in the Member States get your act together.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I am delighted with the cooperation in connection with the discharge. I am certain that we shall achieve a result, but it requires openness and honesty from all parties. We in Parliament are in no doubt that we want to be involved in doing something sensible, and we shall give discharge in April if we get what we are asking for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet again, public opinion will be the first casualty when the news hits the streets that there is to be no positive statement of assurance for European expenditure this time round either. Everyone knows – and this will crop up time and again – that the Member States spend the most money. So they must be the first port of call when it comes to raising revenue as I see it. It is also no secret that the lion’s share of expenditure goes on agriculture. A number of years ago, the Commission established, at Parliament’s insistence, that if there are irregularities, this could mean an additional financial correction of 25% for the Member States. I understand that the Court of Auditors is studying this, and would it not have been interesting if the Court of Auditors had studied what effects this had? Could the same principle be applied to other sectors? I would be very interested to know.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely share Mr Blak’s dissatisfaction with the fact that the Court of Auditor’s report does not contain exact figures. Is the reliability of the expenditure 5% or 7%, and is it true that reliability is less than 3% in the case of agricultural expenditure? The Court of Auditor’s constant refrain is that they do not have sufficient staff to analyse this. That may well be true, but when the Court of Auditors reaches a verdict, I take it as read that it will be based on exact figures. What I would like to know is why these figures cannot be published? I also think we should set up a mediation committee for agriculture. Then, any disputes between the Commission and the financial corrections could be brought before it. Would the Commission and the Court of Auditors be prepared to endorse this proposal?</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, Madam President, this financial report covers 1999. The Commission is bound to point out that it did not take office until September 1999, and will therefore deny all responsibility. I think it is high time we heard the last of that. I feel the Commission must give us a clear indication of when it expects to be able to deliver a positive statement of assurance, for we cannot keep postponing it year after year, as we have done since 1995. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank you for the procedure you followed. We were able to read things through more than a week in advance, and come well prepared. I believe that in principle it is a sound procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Only, to be perfectly honest with you, I was rather disenchanted with yesterday’s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control. It was too short. And you actually failed to answer a number of precise and really rather crucial questions put to you by the delegates, which I think is a shame. Some of these questions have already cropped up again in today’s debate, and I read in today’s <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung</span> that some of your colleagues <span class="italic">do</span> make detailed statements. Their themes are fraud, irregularities, and mistakes running to DM 8 billion. I also read that the erroneous percentage is certainly in excess of 5%. Why do we keep harping on about this figure? Both Mr Mulder and the rapporteur did the same. We want to know why because it is important in our estimation. We have made political statements about this in the past. I would therefore be grateful if you could respond to this question again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that things are in very bad shape in the Commission, and that it still lacks a culture whereby the European taxpayer’s money is administered effectively. That is a pity. Of course, we all know that the Commission is working on its programme of reform. The President of the Court of Auditors also made reference to this, and in this sense, next year’s report will, of course, be the moment of truth.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also indeed a need for action in the regional and national parliaments, because it is the Member States themselves that are responsible for a great many errors. I would therefore urge my counterparts in the national parliaments to ratify the two conventions that have yet to be ratified by all the Member States. I also call upon the Ministers, Heads of State and Government to endorse the proposal for a European Public Ministry at the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, a final request. Could you please make your report a little more user-friendly? Tell the whole story. Name those Member States that are performing well, and those that are doing badly in some areas. It will make it more readable. It will raise interest in your report and give people the incentive to do better next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and the Member States should see it in this light and use the findings of this report as a tool for improving their performance in managing the EU's finances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that it is not possible for the Court of Auditors to give a clean bill of health to the Commission with a positive Statement of Assurance. This situation has not changed since the first Statement of Assurance was published in respect of the 1994 budgetary year. Member States are responsible for managing 80% of the expenditure and a range of errors has been found by the Court at Member State level. This is somewhat disquieting. We should remind ourselves that the EU resources come directly or indirectly from European citizens. There is, therefore, a clear duty to account for every last euro of expenditure. We must ensure that the European citizens receive value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission has taken steps to improve its management control over Community finances, and systems are being put in place in the Member States. This will diminish the level of errors. The Commission must be vigilant in its pursuit of proper management procedures at Member State level. We in Parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the Commission carries out this task.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has responsibility for implementing the budget. Proper management and control procedures, lack of planning, inadequate evaluations, loose or non-existent eligibility criteria frequently feature in this report. This, combined with the negative Statement of Assurance, makes some worrying reading for the taxpayer. I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to embark on in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance when it comes to Community spending. In conclusion, let us approach our task in a positive and constructive spirit in the best interests of the citizens of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a representative of these net payers, however, I am really rather disappointed in the Commission’s performance. We could give this Commission the benefit of the doubt over the discharge for 1998 because it was saddled with the legacy of the ousted Commission. However, the present Commission has to answer for the 1999 annual report and, unfortunately, it lists a whole series of shortcomings in the Commission’s accounts. What concerns me is that the Commission evidently does not consider itself bound by the budget approved by Parliament. Firstly, the Commission has committed EUR 400 million more than we budgeted for, and secondly, it has modified the original budget and implemented a revised version without Parliament’s approval.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the Netherlands only received 3% of total agricultural subsidies, when proportionally, it should work out at around 5%. I do not begrudge the poorer EU countries a comparatively larger share of agricultural aid, but to me, this makes it all the more unpalatable that the majority of irregularities should have arisen in the payment of agricultural subsidies. I would be very interested to know which Member States have benefited the most from these irregularities. The number of irregularities in the structural funds payments warrants a thorough investigation into the way these funds operate and their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforming the Commission is no guarantee that previously recorded irregularities will not arise in the future. Therefore, now and in the future, the Commission will be held to account for non-compliance with the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I especially appreciate the impartiality of his report, in which he points out the faults and praises the progress; for instance, he praises the fact that the Commission is getting moving. I belong to a group of MEPs working on the reform; we have just been with President Prodi and have seen that he has personally taken on the development of the White Paper in accordance with many of the recommendations that have been received year after year from the Court over which Mr Karlsson so ably presides. It must be said that this is actually a process on paper which takes time to turn into action, but it is going along the right road. It is going along the road that you, this Parliament and the independent experts are indicating. Problems still lie ahead on this road, however, such as the overly-long transitional period laid down for the reform of the Financial Regulation. We are in a period that is bad for everyone, including those responsible for payments, in which we have an old system, a new system and an intermediate period in which there is a certain feeling of confusion. I should be grateful if the Court would issue its opinion on the reform of the Financial Regulation soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I must ask: where is the Council in all this? I think the Council is responsible for five sixths of Mr Karlsson’s report and for the spending it approves. Where is the Council? Right now, Madam President, I should like to stop talking and wait for someone from the Council to come here. Therefore, may I suggest that in the next debate on the presentation of the accounts, the Council should be present and intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the part of the report I most value is the recognition that the Commission is getting moving; but the same cannot be said about the Council, whose importance lies not only in the spending figures. You say that you keep on drawing attention to serious and persistent weaknesses in Member States’ control and management systems, and you say that most of the errors occur in the main spending programmes managed by the Member States’ administrations. I believe that we, the members of this Parliament, will be able to point to and lay the blame on our own administrations if they do not meet their commitments, but you have to do us the favour of clearly indicating the States and the programmes. I am convinced that in order for the Community’s financial interests to be properly defended any management failures must have consequences in the budget and Parliament must be able to deny funds to a Member State for repeated breaches of spending control regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can I first of all thank Mr Karlsson because cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control this year has been much better than in previous years. Your work is crucial to our job because you are the experts and we then sort out the political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that this report refers to the 1999 budget, the year when there was the forced resignation of the Commission, so it is clearly too early to judge yet. Next year will be the beginning of the real test as to whether the Commission's reform has started to bite at all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that a key part of the Commission's reform is the whole question of who takes responsibility. Where does the buck stop? Who is responsible? We should today be assessing how the Commission and the Member States spend the money rather than assessing the work of the Court of Auditors. But I find that the work of the Court of Auditors has not been done sufficiently well to help us to do our job.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, and I hope the Council once again is listening, that 80% of the money is spent in the Member States. The Court, as in other years, has failed to point out exactly where those failures occurred. We have asked time and time again for a 'sinners list'. We want to know where the problems lie, in which Member States, in which areas. We even want to know about good practice. You will note from one part of the report that two Member States have been exemplary in terms of VAT collection but how are other Member States supposed to copy these Member States if they do not know who they are.</p>
<p class="contents">We need names. If you the Court will not do your job of naming and shaming, then we will have to do it for you. But your legitimacy as an auditing body will be questioned, and some might even suggest that some members of the Court are keen to protect the interests of Member States that nominated them. Will you make a commitment to do this in future, Mr Karlsson, because a lack of clear information in the report makes it very difficult for us to put pressure in the right areas on the worst offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on you also to publish a league table of those countries which have the worst record of maladministration in the EU and in what areas. Europe's taxpayers deserve to know where the money is going. Without the facts we are fighting fraud with one hand tied behind our back.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are no magic solutions to improving financial control in the Commission. The whole process will take time. We have a lot of vested interests to challenge but we will be watching next year's report for concrete evidence that the measures the Commission has put in place since its investiture have had a real impact in stamping out financial mismanagement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to do all this on the already modest budgets we have at present, how are we to manage when these countries actually become members and start participating in the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds? My group therefore feels it is imperative to start implementing our rules on financial control in the candidate countries without delay. We cannot start treating them as fully-fledged members soon enough in this respect. I would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to give us more information about this in future reports, so that we do not have to face any nasty surprises come accession day.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, it is all very well having one representative from the Council here, but that is not enough, because – as has already been pointed out on several occasions – the majority of serious errors have been committed in the Member States. The Committee on Budgetary Control can no longer tolerate the impression being created, year in year out, that ‘it is a real shambles in Brussels’, when the main culprits are sitting in the capital cities. That is why, Mr Karlsson, we are asking you to give us a better idea of who is doing well and who is making a mess of it. Only then, i.e. if those responsible are named, will we be able to tackle them and really get down to putting Europe’s house in order, so as to win back our citizens’ trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, winning back that trust is also an important aspect, and I hope that by the end of this year, Parliament will have a clear statute, so that never again will these delegates be shown in a poor light in a Court of Auditors report. In order to achieve this, I also wish you, Madam President, a great deal of staying power, and would like to thank you for the commitment you have already shown to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would also like to support what Mr Staes said earlier. I think that if the Court leaves this much room for interpretation in its report, the result will always be critical headlines. For example, the <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung </span>today has "Over DM 8 billion misspent – Court of Auditors refuses to give Commission discharge – Accusations of sloppy budget management". This headline relates to a press conference by Mr Friedmann, and I must ask, Mr Karlsson, why Members of the Court of Auditors are making different statements, first in our Committee on Budgetary Control and then apparently to the press.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we urgently need clearer criteria for next year's report by the Court of Auditors. The Commission and the Court really have a duty here. We need objectives in the various sectors, so that the public can genuinely judge where improvements have been made, otherwise the same thing will happen again every year, despite Parliament's endeavours in the direction of reform, based on the Court of Auditors' reports. We give our blessing to these reforms and then headlines like this more or less wipe out the benefit of all these efforts at reform in the public's eyes, because the public then just focuses on the mistakes and does not see the efforts that have been made to really achieve reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore implore all of you to consider once again how we can set objectives so that we will be better prepared in terms of media relations next year.</p>

I am saddened to see that the Members of the Court of Auditors do not apparently respect this kind of agreement. So my question is whether we should repeat an arrangement of this kind in the coming years. I really think that you should have some concerns about the culture on your side, if the Court of Auditors is not capable of keeping its side of the bargain on such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, various honourable Members have already mentioned the lack of clarity here. You know, Mr Karlsson, that if you do not include the figures in the report, then others will work them out for you. Mrs Rühle and other previous speakers have mentioned percentages. Bearing in mind that there are error rates of up to 7%, Mrs Schreyer can no longer come along and tell us that the Court has endorsed the Commission's actions and has said that the Commission is on the right track, because that, of course, would be the track over the edge of the cliff! But you have not included that in your report, and I am sick and tired of hearing, year after year, that the Member States are responsible for 80% and the Commission for only 20%, while the report itself does not point the finger of blame! The points Mrs van der Laan made earlier should be included, and I am pleased to say that we agree about that. Let me be quite clear about this, you should name the Member States who are to blame even if you are nominated as Members of the Court of Auditors by those same Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, we have to judge what the new Commission achieved in 1999. What disturbs me, Mrs Schreyer, is that in many cases you have not honoured the commitments you gave to act on the Court's comments. I urge you, there really is some scope for improvement in the future – otherwise, your protestations that you want to adopt the right approach in tackling irregularities will merely be empty words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate the Commission, and Commissioner Schreyer in particular, on the Court's observation that many of the changes it has requested are being implemented or are on the way to being implemented. There is particular praise for the reform programme set in motion last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pick on the Council by asking why it is not moving forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation. Parliament moved very quickly to give its opinion and I hope that Council will be able to do the same and adopt its position well before Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I was disappointed in the report as the first step in the discharge procedure. It is too political in the negative sense of the word. It avoids strong criticisms and it does not point any fingers. Other Members have already pointed this out. Member States should be put on the spot when they misuse Community funds, and political groups in this Parliament should be named when they misuse taxpayers' money, as my colleague, Mr Kuhne, pointed out earlier this year. The error rate should be made explicit so that targets can be set for getting the error rate down.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at the way the Court works and how its independence from the institutions and the programmes it is meant to audit can be strengthened. That may require giving the President of the Court more power to take decisions on the Court's working methods and on the way it communicates.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words about Parliament's place in this report. The report is positive about steps that have been taken by Parliament to remedy problems that have been identified by the Court, too positive in my view. Many of these changes have either not yet been implemented or have been implemented partially. Parliament can solve most problems by swiftly moving on two fronts. Firstly, by instituting its own internal audit service and secondly, by adopting three urgently needed statutes: a statute for Members, a statute for assistants and a statute for political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Karlsson, while we, as a Parliament, make all these changes, perhaps you could go and help America count its votes! The error rate in the Florida count is clearly still too high. Perhaps some European Union common sense will help sort out the problem and give George Bush his rightful place in history – its dustbin! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But in addition to these, Mr President, we need more detailed explanations and analyses in order to progress. Let me quickly expand upon three points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a question of terminology: even though all too often no clear distinction is made between the notions of fraud and irregularity, the Court of Auditors warns us against the temptation to consider irregularities or errors as tantamount to cases of fraud. But it must be pointed out that the Court of Auditors itself says that cases of fraud are few in number.</p>
<p class="contents">This report raises another point: the problems linked to VAT. VAT is an important component of the Community budget revenues. But it has to be recognised that we are faced with a complex system. Rates differ from one Member State to the next; their make-up also differs from one Member State to the next. For example, there is regional VAT in some Member States. We also still need to continue to question the implementing of fiscal harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make concerns the debate which took place yesterday evening when the Court of Auditors’ presented its annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control. The Court of Auditors was asked – and a number of speakers have reminded us of this morning – to explicitly name the Member States in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered. I would warn us against the temptation to indulge in such practices. We are not looking for scapegoats, either in our institutions or in our Member States. What is more, as the working method applied by the Court of Auditors is based on sampling, we only have a partial view of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from the Court of Auditors highlights, somewhat more so than in the past, the situation regarding the management and control of Community funds by the Member States. This analysis should lead us, as MEPs, and the Commission to put forward proposals to improve the management and financial control systems which the Member States must implement in order to protect the financial interests of the European Union. In conclusion, I would call for improved cooperation with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, over the last two years the Court of Auditors has published six special reports on the subject of the common agricultural policy. In its special report on subsidies for the disposal of skimmed milk, it highlights a lack of supervisory measures, a level of falsification of milk data and fraudulent use of this data that is unparalleled in any other agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report on the disposal of butter, the Court of Auditors noted that 89% of the budget is spent on subsidies to the food industry through procedures of dubious transparency and of even more dubious efficiency in terms of their impact on farmers’ incomes. In both cases, this involves a limited number of countries and a limited number of economic agents, who are the direct beneficiaries of these policies. In what has been its most important work on the common agricultural policy, the special report on arable crops, the Court concluded that, from 1993 to 1997, the Community budget paid out a sum of more than EUR 13 billion more than could reasonably have been expected. Arable crops represent 43% of the CAP budget, but only 10.7% of the end product. In 1995, almost 40% of payments went to the top 3% of beneficiaries, whilst 57%, the smaller beneficiaries, received only 4.5% of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court, therefore, quite rightly concluded that support for farmers should not be provided on the basis of price, production or area, but of support for the net income of farmers or of agricultural work units. These are excellent, high-quality documents, which are a "drop in the ocean" in a common agricultural policy that still gives special treatment to larger farmers at the expense of the smaller ones and to countries and regions at the heart of Europe at the expense of peripheral countries and regions. It is a shame that the Court of Auditors’ annual report, which is supposedly drawn up to reflect the most relevant aspects of the work undertaken in the course of the year through the special reports, did not include these studies and decided to concentrate on other issues on which it had not undertaken specific studies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karlsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Court of Auditors</span>. – First of all, on the procedure for presenting the annual report to Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee, I am happy to listen to the assurances from Members of Parliament that the situation this year is more satisfactory than before. I hope that we can jointly conclude that we have found the right approach to the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mr Staes that I am sorry I did not have the chance to answer all the questions that were asked in yesterday's meeting. I may also have that problem today. However, I pointed out that we are only at the beginning of this discharge procedure. I sincerely hope that we will be able to give a reasonable answer to any question that Parliament or the Budgetary Control Committee wishes to ask and that all questions that were asked yesterday and in this debate will be properly answered.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the construction of the Statement of Assurance and the question of figures. First of all I point out – not only to Mr Blak, rapporteur for this year's discharge, but to Mr Mulder – that we have gradually changed and developed the procedure for drawing up the Statement of Assurance in close collaboration with this Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee, to meet with the wishes of the Committee by including in the Statement of Assurance the specific observations in the different budget areas. This is a result of the discussion that we have had hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise – to Mr Mulder, Mr Blak, Mrs van der Laan, Mrs Morgan and to all the other speakers who have expressed themselves on this issue – that the Court will continue to develop that. But I should like to make it abundantly clear that a procedure of this kind has to develop very gradually so that we do not have a complete change in the method of data collation because then the value of this exercise would not meet the requirements we are set under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the accuracy of the figure that Mr Blak queried: 5.5% or 3%? I do not want to sound demagogic but this question is intellectually on the same level as the question "when did you stop beating your wife". Do not ask me questions that are impossible to answer. We did not produce a figure last year and we have not produced a figure this year. So the question of whether last year's figure corresponds to this year's figure is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">A Statement of Assurance is a very detailed exercise, including not only specific observations on the different budget areas but also a global appraisal. We will study that in detail, with your excellent secretaries. I am very happy to hear that you have staff at your disposal able to summarise the Court's report in one hour. I am extremely happy. Perhaps we will steal that person from you. But we will have a chance to go through all that. I will see to it that the rapporteur for the discharge is fully informed of all the details.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Budgetary Control Committee point out the need for more precision. You are right that we have to be more precise in our observations. When you study this annual report you will find that what the Court is trying to do is to see to it that the clearance of accounts becomes a real instrument for analysing shortcomings in implementing the agricultural policy. But a delay of more than two years makes the value of this exercise very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also point out is that, in the other area of the big bulk of spending in the Member States, we do not have a procedure corresponding to the clearance of accounts. That is in the Structural Funds. It is very difficult to be more precise when we do not have a clearance system that would give the answers that we ask for, for instance in respect of the Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I pledge that we will continue, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament, to see that we develop more precise information so as to tackle the real problem. The Court entirely agrees with Parliament that it is not only a question of reform of the Commission or of Parliament reforming its way of working with financial control. The Court of Auditors also has to change its working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, to the question of naming: I cannot accept Mr van Hulten's view that this report is too political in the sense that we avoid naming the names that should be named. You are listening to a Member who, as rapporteur for the Committee on Development, was once responsible for naming not only two countries but two companies and where the Court of Auditors was taken to the Court of Justice because of that.</p>
<p class="contents">He implies that for political reasons we are scared to mention the names necessary for the audit that we independently find important, but I have evidence to prove the opposite. It was quite clear, in this particular case, that the Court of First Instance supported us by saying we not only have the right to mention these names but also a duty to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the report of the Court of Auditors on the anti-pollution measures of the Commission, you will find not only countries named but also regions and the French Member of the Court of Auditors from Brittany, Mr Jean-François Bernicot, did not protest at the fact that we dealt with his Brittany page after page.</p>
<p class="contents">When it is relevant, from the audit point of view, we mention everything that has to be mentioned. This is the policy and principle of the Court. The intention of the Court of Auditors is not to become a political instrument but to be an objective instrument for your political control here in Parliament and we will continue to work towards this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I pledge that we will listen carefully to Parliament's requests for more precise instruments of analysis and we will ensure that we can use all these instruments to satisfy the needs of political control. I will come back to that next time when I report and give you the plan for the programme of work for next year when we see each other again.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress, Mr Mulder, what I said yesterday. From a technical, statistical point of view, specific DAS figures on each country and major political field would require an enormous amount of personnel because when you diminish the population you increase the need for the sample so the amount of sampling will require an enormous amount of work that I do not think anyone would find feasible. That is why we should use other methods and adopt the approach that we have agreed on the specific observations field and bring the DAS exercise more in line with the other audits, not only of the Court, but also of the Commission and of the Member States, in the clearance of accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also thinking about Florida this morning, Mr van Hulten, and I am thankful that I was not responsible for auditing the election procedure in that specific state. There is always something to be happy about.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the debate is over so that I can answer any question that I may have forgotten. I must comment, Mr Blak, on what you said. You want us to restructure the report and we have done that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to remind you that after the dialogue that we had between the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have restructured the report. You suggested that the report should reflect the portfolios of commissioners or directors-general. I would warn against that. Commissioners, like Mr Fischler who is responsible for executing half of the budget, must have a bigger chapter than those commissioners who have no dealings with the budget. Let us be open and discuss how we will structure the reporting so that it will be as satisfactory as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
