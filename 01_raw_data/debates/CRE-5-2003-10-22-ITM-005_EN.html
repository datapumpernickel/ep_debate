<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of comments by way of an introduction to this annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It takes as its starting point the dramatic events of the Iraq war and the effect that had on the European Union’s internal cohesion, on transatlantic relations and also on the state of affairs within the United Nations and NATO, as well as on the international order as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">What now matters, in our view, is that we see the crisis associated with the war in Iraq as an opportunity, and accept the challenge of establishing Europe, once and for all, as a foreign policy actor of substance. Europe must cease to be an observer in global policy matters and become a participant. The constitutional convention created the institutional framework within which it can do so by creating the position of European Foreign Minister, by making enhanced cooperation possible in the defence sphere and also by establishing the European armaments agency. These proposals represent an absolute minimum, and the Intergovernmental Conference must not now be allowed to water them down.</p>
<p class="contents">We expected much more when it comes to the Council’s voting procedures and Parliament’s right to be informed and consulted, and so, in the light of a proactive policy of crisis prevention, we believe it to be necessary for us, in future, to be informed and involved as early as the early-warning and planning stages of crisis operations under the ESDP. Both the CFSP and the ESDP need an efficient institutional framework, but that will not be enough; it must have political content added to it. This is what the European security doctrine put forward by Mr Solana is for, and this report gives four reasons for endorsing his approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that Europe must find its way to a clear prioritisation of its foreign and security policy interests and objectives, jointly define them and also designate them geographically, as we have done under item 8.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that a European security strategy must counterpose to the narrowly military focus in current thinking by the American administration a comprehensive approach to security that includes political, economic, social and inter-cultural efforts to mitigate and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a European security doctrine can be developed only on the basis of effective multilateralism and within the UN system, this being in line with the historic experiences and political interests of its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, even though the prevention and resolution of conflicts by non-military means will always be at the heart of any security strategy adopted by the European Union, the credibility of the European Foreign and Security Policy is, in the final analysis, dependent on the quality of its military capabilities and on the political willingness to deploy them in the event of any conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in the context of a European concept of security, are our foreign policy priorities? Although transatlantic relations still have pride of place among them, Europe will carry equal weight as a partner for the USA only as and when the Member States summon up the political will to make their own specifically national interests subject to those of the Community. We will also be able to strengthen such organisations as the UN or NATO only if Europe and the USA speak with one voice. New life must be breathed into the strategic debate between Europe and the USA; that is another reason why Mr Solana’s paper is so important. It will cover such topics as the stabilisation, reconstruction and state building in Iraq, a common strategy on Iran and, generally speaking, possible ways of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the tactics to be adopted when dealing with repressive and dictatorial regimes and dysfunctional states.</p>
<p class="contents">One primary task that remains is that of bringing peace to the Middle East as part of the Quartet, where it has to be clear to us that the Quartet, rather than merely being present on paper, should perhaps work together in the region. There is no doubt that Europe will continue to be committed to the Western Balkans and in Afghanistan, whatever the many problems that are evident in both of them, and even though we cannot but be openly pessimistic about our chances of success when it comes to properly building an acceptable state in the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more attention needs to be given to the Southern Caucasus, which is becoming one of the EU’s least stable neighbouring regions, and in this, relations with Russia will have a large part to play. With enlargement, the Union’s external borders are being drawn ever closer to the crisis areas to the east and south-east. It is of the utmost importance that security zones be established around Europe, and that an effective neighbourhood policy be developed; our deliberations should therefore focus much more on such ideas as a ‘European Economic Area Plus’ and others of the kind, as well as on consideration of the particular ways in which the Mediterranean region can be further stabilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to explain our criticisms of the Council’s annual report. Anyone picking up this 200-page volume will observe that it more resembles a shop’s inventory than an annual political review. Things used not to be as bad as that. Such a report is no use when it comes to conducting dialogue between Parliament and the Council. It must become more political, as it once was, with clear evaluations and the setting of objectives. It is for that reason that we ask that the High Representative should continue, in future, to provide us with a written report on the progress made in putting Europe’s security principles into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying something about the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This annual report will be the last in the life of this current Parliament. It shows the positions of the political groups coinciding to a remarkable degree, in a way that they have not done since this Parliament was elected. That is another fruit of the constructive collaboration in this committee, for which I wish to express my gratitude to the committee’s members and its staff. Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened to Mr Brok's comments just now with great interest and very much appreciate what he said. Let me start with this point: Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Brok is quite right in saying that a new situation has recently emerged with regard to the Iraq crisis, which has had such an enormous and unprecedented impact on our common foreign policy that some observers believe it casts doubt on the very survival of the CFSP. Against this backdrop, I wish to say that I totally disagree with the notion that Iraq has destroyed our Common Foreign and Security Policy. Quite the opposite, in fact: the ill ease felt by Member States about the divisions created by the Iraq crisis and the commitment that we have made to overcoming the existing deadlock have demonstrated, if anything, the extent to which all of us in Europe are firmly committed to a common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the Common Foreign and Security Policy now faces a real systemic challenge in the form of enlargement, or, as we like to put it, the reunification of the European Union. If we are unable to find institutional solutions, there is a risk that the deadlock situations we have experienced will recur.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the role of the Union on the world stage. There is no denying that the Union has global interests, which are certainly not limited to economic interests, and that it should be willing to defend the values which inspire and are at the heart of our peoples' lives and rules of life. My question, however, is this: is the Union able and willing to be considered a global power? I believe that, even if we have limited resources at our disposal and should, therefore, be selective about where we intervene, it is, nevertheless, in Europe's wider interest to adopt a global approach as regards both our analysis and our foreign policy endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can we draw from our awareness of these three problems, which undeniably exist? It is important to recognise that the Union's record in the field of foreign policy is a positive one, and the Brok report confirms this. I shall restrict myself to mentioning the progress made in establishing a European military capacity and our initial experiences with this both in conjunction with NATO – an example of this being the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – and also acting on our own, as in the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo. I would also like to mention the Union’s contribution to stabilising the Balkans and to the process of both economic and democratic reconstruction of the countries in that region. I would further remind you about the support given to the United Nations at a point when the role of that organisation was being called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as Europeans, have reiterated the validity of a multilateral approach to crisis resolution, and, as a more ambitious objective, the implementation of effective multilateralism as a means of preventing, and, if necessary, opposing breaches of international law. I would also like to mention the significant action taken by the Union and its Member States in response to the global challenges we face today: combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just mentioned a few important areas by way of example, to demonstrate that we have, in a number of cases, succeeded in following words and commitments with deeds. Of course, and I agree with Mr Brok's report on this point, this is not enough to satisfy the demands that the citizens of Europe and the third countries are making of us. The Council of Ministers is aware of this, and we are working towards solutions in two areas: institutional effectiveness and the clear, precise setting of strategic priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards institutional effectiveness – which President Berlusconi has already talked about here in this Chamber today – I can confirm that, in the Intergovernmental Conference, we will be defending the framework presented by the Convention, without any backsliding, as a good basis for the work of the IGC. With regard to the second area, strategy, as you know, the European Council scheduled for December 2003 will be called upon to adopt a document that will include the Union's security strategy. It is an ambitious text that will provide a framework for all the interest and commitment invested in our Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy will outline the threats currently facing the European Union, but it also needs to identify those areas on whose stability our security depends. This strategy will be able to guide us in identifying the resources needed for us to become producers of security, as we like to say, and no longer just consumers of security. That is why the Italian Presidency is anxious to foster fruitful cooperation between our common foreign policy and the activities of international organisations active in the field of security. I have in mind, first and foremost, NATO and the OSCE, but what is absolutely vital for us is the role of the United Nations. On 24 September, the Italian Presidency and the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, signed a UN-EU joint declaration in New York as a basis for cooperation in both military and civilian areas of crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that everyone should now recognise that there is a need to take pre-emptive action, rather than just repairing the damage resulting from a crisis that has already exploded. Prevention is therefore becoming a key component in the Union's external relations. This derives from and is characterised by the coordinated use of both the resources of the Member States, which are made available in the common interest, and the Union's own resources, which are managed by the European Commission. We accordingly need to take advantage of the full range of resources that the Union can harness in crisis situations. We have instruments that enable us to exert cultural, economic, political and, now, also military influence. More than any other international organisation, the Union can and should commit itself to tackling the underlying causes of conflicts by helping to eliminate them through pre-emptive action. We are adopting a policy based on influence and incentivation in order to try and encourage progress in regional integration and to overcome situations caused by lack of understanding and by instability.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the successful model on which we have built the European Union, and it is for this reason that we are convinced it is a model worth recommending to our external partners. In particular, I would like to mention the Western Balkans, a sensitive region that deserves special attention. We are endeavouring to step up our cooperation activities in respect of that region, and also in respect of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and, let me remind you, in respect of the Latin American subcontinent. On the same subject, I would like to point out that the benefit of establishing treaty relations with the European Union is, in fact, one of the main incentives for regional groupings. Our security policy therefore dovetails with our policy on development aid in terms of goals, but we should certainly not imagine that it can be a substitute for development aid policy or be allowed to drain resources away from it.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, Mr Brok's report stresses that the Union's interest should focus on its neighbouring regions. Although I have mentioned the Balkans and the Mediterranean region, I wish to emphasise that the difficulties still prevailing in the Middle East have not weakened our resolve: the Union can and must make an important contribution to identifying a peaceful solution and to international guarantees for peace. The Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission are constantly striving to achieve this outcome, and they were encouraged by the final conclusions of last week's European Council. The Council also confirmed the Union's stance on two other international issues currently of vital importance: Iraq, where the Union is committed to contributing to the reconstruction effort, and Iran, which we have very actively encouraged to take the decisive step of complying with all the International Atomic Energy Agency's requirements. Just yesterday, the Republic of Iran took the very positive step of accepting these commitments, with the full support of the presidency. This is obviously something that we have encouraged and welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area of interest for the enlarged Europe is its eastern borders. I have in mind our good-neighbour policy towards Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and slightly further east, the Russian Federation, which I shall return to this afternoon when we discuss the forthcoming Rome Summit on 6 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude my comments by referring to a strategic relationship that is still of fundamental importance for us in Europe: the transatlantic relationship. It is evident that all the Member States continue to attach great importance to relations with the United States. I, personally, also believe that we can overcome the recent breakdowns in understanding. The renewal of this relationship has been confirmed by the recent, hard-won decisions taken within the United Nations. I am convinced this is the case, because Euro-Atlantic relations are nourished by a common history, by an enormous indebtedness in terms of liberation and liberty – particularly for us Italians – and also by shared values and ideals and by common action reflected in the CFSP. Our common commitment in the Balkans, combating terrorism and combating proliferation: these are examples and evidence of common action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Brok has drawn up proposals for future work. I would like to thank him once again, and I agree with his suggestions and proposals. The building of Europe is unprecedented in history, both as regards its political ambition and its institutional mechanisms. I would like to conclude my speech by saying that there are essentially four areas in which we can work, which, for the sake of brevity I shall simply identify.</p>
<p class="contents">The first area is to develop the political will to achieve integration, the hallmark of which will increasingly be foreign policy and the common European defence policy. In this area, the parliamentarians of the Member States will have an essential role to play, and I therefore hope that this Chamber will continue to provide encouragement and drive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is a strategy for the Union's external activities, to be based on the document we shall be presenting by December.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area relates to appropriate and effective decision-making mechanisms. We will be going into that in depth at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final area is that of resources. Although I have left it until last, it is crucial. We must provide ourselves with the necessary resources to achieve the foreign policy we need. The alternative, which I do not like, would be to scale down our ambitions. We have limited budgetary provisions for financing the CFSP, and although we had a small increase in 2003, we certainly need to do a great deal more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency understands and supports the European Parliament's request that it should be given punctual and timely, if not absolutely pre-emptive, information about activities that the European Council is preparing to embark upon. I remain committed to supporting you on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which he knows I have much enjoyed reading. I do not want in the five minutes that I have to repeat all the points that have been made with such eloquence and comprehensiveness by the Italian Presidency but I agree with all that the Minister said.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can just focus on four points very briefly and try to stick to my five minutes. First of all I want to say something about the institutional arrangements. We all know that the present institutional arrangements supporting and providing the infrastructure for CFSP are, to use a common term of art in the European Union, 'sub-optimal'. And we all know that changes in institutional arrangements, the sort of changes proposed in the Convention and being discussed in the IGC, can help to create political will to make things happen more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">But changes in institutions can never be a substitute for political will. We did not have disagreements over Iraq because we lacked the adequate institutional arrangements. We had disagreements over Iraq because of a lack of sufficient political will. It is also fair to say that however much we improve the institutional arrangements – and this was a point touched on by the presidency – we cannot pay the bills with institutional arrangements. If we want to have a more effective international impact, if we want to be seen by the United States as people who are pulling our weight in the security field, we have to face up to the fact that we need to do more and we need to spend more. All the opinion polls show – and this is an interesting reflection of the current debate in Europe – that most of our voters in Europe want there to be a louder European voice politically on the international stage. But unfortunately there is hardly any country where voters are prepared to spend more money on our security in order to help sustain that larger European role. Therefore we have to tackle the present gap between the discussion on institutional arrangements and the discussion both on political will and on resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I should like to mention security and the definition of security. We all know that security needs to be defined in much broader terms than has been conventional in foreign policy debate. One of the great bonuses of the draft security strategy which the High Representative has brought forward is that it demonstrates that security is about more than precision-guided munitions and airlift capacity. It is about issues from public health and disease to terrorism, to organised crime, all the issues where we in the European Union actually have the competence to develop a more coherent, comprehensive external relations policy than is possible in a lot of Member States and in a lot of nation-states. It is very important in my view, therefore, that when we come to construct a joint external service, we make sure that we combine the strengths of both Pillar I and Pillar II in the management and implementation of CFSP. It would be a great mistake if, on the one hand, we cut off the Foreign Minister from the Commission, or on the other hand, if we did the sort of things which would make people suspicious of the Commission being too involved in CFSP issues. So, we have to make sure that, as we design the joint external service, we use the strength of both the Council and the Commission to have the widest possible impact on external problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I want to make is about the importance of the transatlantic partnership. We know that in the run-up to the military intervention in Iraq, Europe was bitterly divided. I have said before that I am not wholly surprised about that since the issues that we were facing in Iraq were extremely difficult and extremely serious. We also know that despite those divisions, by and large, most of the things we want to achieve as Europeans are more achievable if we work with the United States and it has to be said, most of the things the United States wants to achieve are more manageable if it works with the European Union. I hope we will see that now in Iraq with reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be going from this Chamber to Madrid for the Iraq Reconstruction Conference, as will the presidency. We will there, I think, see the presidency able to announce a commitment from the European Union for the first year of reconstruction in Iraq which will be larger than the pledge that we were able to make for Afghanistan at Tokyo. I think we will be committing over the next months more in Iraq than we did on that occasion. We will be committing EUR 200 million from the European budget on top of the EUR 100 million that we have already pledged for humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the figure that we are proposing from the budget is a responsible figure: I think it is a serious figure. It has not obliged us to use up all our flexibility next year or to take money from other important programmes. I think it is far more important for us to be going to Madrid supporting the efforts of reconstruction with a serious contribution rather than a contribution which is merely a political reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth thing I want to say is that we often talk about effective multilateralism and sometimes we are asked to define it. I think what we have seen happen in the last 24 hours in Iran is a good example of effective multilateralism. We have embarked on a policy in Iran of tough-minded but constructive engagement. Engagement does not mean abandoning principle. We have strong views about the human rights situation in Iraq. We have strong views about terrorism. We have strong views about nuclear weapons. But we have been prepared to hold out a hand of friendship to Iran, recognising that it is a great pre-Islamic civilisation. We also recognise – this is certainly my view – that demography in Iran is on the side of democracy, giving Iran the opportunity to be drawn into the international community and not isolated from it. So yesterday's visit seems to me to be an excellent example of how much we can achieve in Europe when we work together and I think it is particularly important to recognise that France, Germany and Britain as well as the other Member States have to give a lead in working together.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will see this sort of combined effort more often, using both the resources that can be provided by Member States and the resources that we have agreed to share in common and the competencies that we have agreed to share. I hope that we will see that sort of effective cooperation. I hope that we will not see too much institutional warfare. I certainly think that the issues that we have to deal with on the international stage are far too serious for that, as is made clear in this excellent report.</p>

Whilst we should, in this House, debate matters in greater depth, I do also think that Interinstitutional Agreements can help to unite political will and enable it to achieve a result.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the opinion of the Committee on Budgets reflected its particular interest in the question that the President-in-Office of the Council raised at the end of his speech, that of how we handle the European Union’s budget, and of how things stand as regards Parliament’s right to be informed – not as a purely technical question, but because we need these debates on political priorities. We can have such debates only if we get at a very early stage all the information in the Council’s possession, which is to be discussed in the Council’s working parties and from which a result is to emerge in the course of many stages, rather than having to wait until the Council has taken its decision and all that remains to be done is to rubber-stamp it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to you for your undertaking to make these items of information available to Parliament. We deal with different partners depending on the matter in hand, and this is an issue on which Parliament and the Commission very often work together. In matters of external relations, Parliament, as an institution, always tends to support the Commission in its work, and also tends to be willing to provide more money. In the Budget procedure as elsewhere, the Council sometimes slows things down, and so I believe that this is where a new triangular relationship can be achieved. You then referred to the subject of the United Nations, and the Commission used to take a very technical approach to this and supported its projects, but there were no policy debates. Indeed, the Commission even managed to produce a document on the European Union’s relationship with the United Nations that made no reference whatever to Parliament as the budgetary authority. I think that we have now reached a new stage of dialogue with Commissioner Patten. In our relations with the United Nations, too, we need to set political priorities, and these need to be discussed by the Council and Parliament in their respective budget procedures. That is why this annual report, along with the High Representative’s statements, represents a good step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very topical subject, now that, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, with the return of 10 countries into the European fold the Union is being enlarged in a way that was inconceivable and unhoped for just a few years ago. Of the many countries that are hoping to join the Union, I would like to highlight here the importance of Ukraine, a country balanced between two worlds, the European world and the Slav world, which it would be in our interest to admit to the European Union. I am not just saying that because I have visited that country as a member of a European Parliament delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brok report – as my colleague has just said – provides an excellent assessment of the Council's annual report, which contains nothing more than a simple balance sheet devoid of any in-depth political analysis and scarcely identifies any priorities. If, however, in the short time available to me, I may add something, no matter how slight, to the Brok report, then I would like to support the proposal made by Mr Wuori in an amendment that East Africa should be added to the priority areas listed in the report. We cannot overlook the important and incisive part played by mediation in the Ethiopian-Eritrean, Somali and Sudanese conflicts, a part which involved enormous sacrifices and difficulties on the part of Italy, whose authority was duly recognised. Italy has encouraged the increasing involvement of the European Union in managing such crises, and I believe that it is both right and necessary to include East Africa in the priority areas for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including, specifically, in paragraph 8 of the Brok report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by extending my group’s congratulations to Mr Brok on his report, which is, as always, very balanced and – like his chairmanship of the committee – very circumspect, while carrying a clear message. That is certainly an art, but Mr Brok proves his mastery of it over and over again.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, I would like to start in a slightly different way, as I would like to stress that our primary purpose is to promote Europe’s interests, and that this is not in any way something to be concealed. The only issue is to what extent our interests coincide with those of others, and how often they are in parallel. Particularly in security maters, but also in many other areas, we can see that Europe’s interests parallel those of other regions. If we use the security concept that Commissioner Patten has again put before us today – which would be only right and proper – we will see how we are well able to take other regions’ aspirations into account when properly defending our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things that were discussed and highlighted as long ago as the debate on the presidency was the refugee issue. I hope that what was said will be backed up by actions, by which I mean that we will take action in those countries where people feel – or actually are – forced to flee, and help to prevent refugees flooding into Europe to the extent that they do. That is in our interests but also in the interests of these people, in that we are giving them the chance of a prosperous life in their own country, from which they will not need to escape.</p>
<p class="contents">To be sure, we need partners in this policy. The Americans are, of course, our privileged partners, but we still need to strengthen and develop our relations with other regions such as Russia, China, and India, if we are to cultivate this partnership in an appropriate way. This is pre-eminently the case as regards one issue on which our debates will focus during the coming months, and on which Mr Laschet is completing a report, namely reform of the United Nations. Anyone who – like our group as a whole – wants the United Nations to come into its own, anyone who fully supports the multilateral approach, must also press for the United Nations to be reformed in such a way as to make it more effective whilst remaining representative.</p>
<p class="contents">All those in this group who opposed the USA’s intervention in Iraq must nevertheless acknowledge that it was also – and I emphasise also – due to the failure by the whole structure of the modern-day United Nations that things got to such a pass, and that we did not make a multilateral attempt at regime change in Iraq at an earlier stage, which would have been the right time to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever criticisms might be levelled at our own foreign and security policy, we do, as I said earlier, have grounds for pride. Reference has been made to Iran. Although, institutionally speaking, things could have been better, that was a fine achievement, but it is success that counts, so let us stand by this one. I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for the policy in the Balkans. When we consider what we have achieved in the Balkans in recent years, and how we have managed to bring peace, that is a very positive sign. It also means, however, that Europe has to take up its own responsibilities. If we are prepared to take up our own responsibilities in our own back yard, then we can achieve success.</p>

The resolution even demands that those parts of the wall that have already been built should be torn down. Today’s bad news is that, in spite of the UN decision, Israel is continuing to build the wall. In the report we are debating, the European Parliament regards the bringing of peace to the Middle East as the most important task to be shared with the United States, together with Russia and the UN. We reiterate, moreover, our unqualified support, with which the UN decision is splendidly in keeping, for the implementation of the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are also able, together with Commissioner Patten, to be delighted that the hierocracy in Iran is to allow comprehensive inspections and to refrain from producing uranium for use in nuclear weapons. The final Iranian acceptance of nuclear inspections followed a visit by the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Great Britain – an international agreement for which the EU can take credit. We are today debating a sound report, and that is something for which I should also like to thank Mr Brok. It is a very concise report, but not a short one, and I only have a short time in which to mention some of the points I think important. The US-NATO relationship is quite fundamental to the European security structure, and we must support the development of reinforced cooperation in the defence area.</p>
<p class="contents">Asia, and China in particular, has not been given as much attention in the report as might perhaps have been wished. The increased tensions in relations between China and North Korea is cause for concern, but what is more worrying is, of course, the fact that North Korea will not phase out its nuclear weapons programme. We regard this as a considerable threat to stability in Asia. The Taiwan issue must also be mentioned in this context. In a democratic institution such as this, we must regret the lack of progress on this matter. Taiwan is both democratic and peaceful, but the Taiwanese cannot live in the same manner as people in other free, democratic countries, given the way its neighbour is behaving. I should like to call for a new dialogue between China and Taiwan and for the EU to do more in pressing for a solution to the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just have to say something that will surprise nobody, that being that my group is not numbered among that majority. I would like to clarify, though, that I do think it necessary for the European Union to really pursue a common foreign policy – in parts, indeed, a foreign policy along Community lines. Without one, as the example adduced by Mr Andreasen shows, we will find it difficult or impossible to get the world to give us a hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that one good thing about this report, in my view, is that it defines as a real alternative a new approach to security and puts the emphasis on multilateralism. Its actual tendency, though, does not have the rigour that it needs to distinguish itself from something that I regard as giving cause for concern. I would like to highlight two examples. Firstly, I regret the committee’s inability to tackle the problem of the maintenance, defence and further development of the weapons monitoring and disarmament system. How are we to put a stop to the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction if our own draft constitution obliges us to build up our own military capacities or potential, the like of which is to be found in no constitution in the world and never has been? We are, in effect, committing ourselves to rearmament instead of setting ourselves targets for disarmament. The American attitude towards the control of biological and chemical weapons, the Test Ban Treaty and their threat to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty make this a very live issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that the report explicitly highlights the need to build up military capabilities, despite the European concentration on civil approaches to conflict prevention. In Europe, we can currently see positive examples of how conflicts have not escalated into warfare, one example being the Caucasus. Why not analyse these experiences and apply them generally? That we are at last making a start on a serious debate about the European Union’s security strategy is something that I very much welcome, but it is lamentable that this debate is still, on the whole, an internal affair in which the general public are not involved. I call upon the Council and the Commission to involve Parliament in the debate more than it has been so far, rather than confronting us with ready-made concepts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if that is what the European Union does, it should do so in a way that is different from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not try to be a military superpower, but, I would say, a civil superpower. These points are hammered home in the report, and rightly. Our strengths should lie in diplomacy, trade and conflict prevention. These are, and remain, the core elements of common foreign policy. And let there be no misunderstanding about this: a military capacity forms part of this. The European Union should be capable of doing more than it is doing at the moment, but it should be capable of doing something other than the United States. This means, for example, that the first priority should be, as is stated in the report, to build our own rapid intervention force and not to focus on a NATO Rapid Response Force. This also means – and on that score I do not see eye to eye with the Commissioner – that more effective spending of what we are paying out on defence at the moment should be Priority Number One. I cannot explain to my electors that we need to spend more on defence if they know that current spending is so very inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone following the discussion in the media could be forgiven for thinking that the essence of the discussion between the EU and NATO was about headquarters.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be quite clear about this: it is not about headquarters. The United States is frightened that the European Union will develop its own, alternative view, and will come up with an alternative analysis of what security is – an analysis and a strategy that will deviate from those of the United States. I urge you not to be deterred by this resistance from the other side of the ocean. The United States does not benefit from having an obedient follower. It does, however, benefit from having a confident partner with its own vision. This means that parliamentary democratic control should form part of this vision. We can talk as much as we like about any vision whatsoever, but, if there is no Parliamentary monitoring in place, and if finances are the only concern from start to finish, then this vision will not become reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This common admonition seems to be very relevant in the case of Europe's security. I urge you not to trade NATO for such uncertain military aspirations cherished by a number of EU Member States. Meanwhile, this defence ambition on this side of the ocean causes renewed internal European division, as well as fresh transatlantic tension. I fully share America's great concern about NATO's cohesion and future, given the autonomous military course taken by President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder. The ambivalent ideas about security in Paris and Berlin are entirely reflected in the Brok report: the EU as a complementary security organisation of NATO no less!</p>
<p class="contents">The Brok report is honest enough to recognise that the EU's current military capacities are inadequate for peace operations. In short, I would prefer NATO to look after our security in Europe, and – within the NATO context – to let the EU Member States finally show what they are worth as loyal allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Samuel Huntington has pointed out, we progressed, after the Cold War, from a bipolar to a multipolar world, and more than ever before, what matters is to identify friend and foe and, hence, also the threats that face us. As has rightly been pointed out, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and badly governed states are Europe's three most important threats. I should also like to add the demographic pressure of an uncontrollable and encroaching Islam to this list. Europe must therefore provide an efficient and well-developed security and defence system. This will require political will, as well as investments. In that respect, we have to conclude with some sense of shame that the average outgoings for each soldier in Belgium are three times lower than in the other European Member States. The Belgian Government has already announced that it will not be increasing the defence budget during this term in office, which has, in fact, only just started. It is therefore a sign of some hypocrisy on the part of the Belgian Government if it wants to take the lead in the development of a defence system at European level on the one hand, while refusing to accept the consequences and obligations that this entails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad of one thing that he makes clear in it, namely that it is not enough for us to produce a European security strategy as a constructive response to that of the United States; on the contrary, we must also show how it is to be achieved. That is why we need a two-stage plan of the kind proposed in the Brok report, with, as its first step, the formation of a European crisis intervention force for evacuation operations and humanitarian tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries us at present is our relationship with the United States and especially their reaction to these proposals and to those made by the Convention, which has put forward the idea of a mutual defence commitment for the countries of Europe. This causes concern to the United States, which take a critical attitude towards it, as they do – vehemently – towards the proposal for enhanced cooperation between a number of European countries. Then the proposal was made for a European armaments agency to combine our capacities, and our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic objected to that. There is one thing that we have to make clear here: on the one hand, our friends demand that we should develop our capacities and abilities to play a greater global security role and to make our contribution in this area. If we want to do that, we have to combine our capacities, and that, after all, is what these proposals are all about. We must, then, be clear in our own minds, and make it clear to the Americans, that if we combine our capacities in Europe, that is not being done only for Europe’s benefit, but also for that of the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report bears witness to how much the world situation has changed since last year. At that time, terrorist attacks were uppermost in our minds, whereas now the focus is on the invasion of Iraq. The rapporteur reminds us of the chasms that have been thrown up between the Member States of the European Union, which have severely strained transatlantic relations and which have affected different NATO members to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok believes that it is, however, now necessary to redefine Europe's role and, perhaps, to take advantage of the political crisis sparked by the war to make the Union a credible and powerful political actor on the foreign policy stage. Of course, the means of achieving this objective are still relatively ill-defined: some new Member States and their neighbours have, yet again, discovered America and its promises of political and economic guarantees. For this reason, it is advisable not to forget Member States' duty to refrain from intervening in international affairs on the basis of unilateral national positions until the European Union has had an opportunity to define a common European position.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, of course, have time to go into all this in greater depth, but the future of our foreign policy is linked to the European Constitution; the veto can wreck the most ambitious peace plans, as we have heard this morning. The European Union's common foreign and security policy objectives depend, not least, on its ability to equip itself with military resources, with the result that we can only envisage relatively low-cost operations. Perhaps we shall have to content ourselves with that, even though, ultimately, I do not believe we can. The Franco-German Brigade alone, a core Rapid Reaction Force, might well have been enough to stop the Balkan crisis in 1991, as Mr Frattini has also said today. We must insist: in addition to the small steps forward achieved …</p>

<p class="contents">What used to fall within the exclusive remit of NATO or was a matter of national sovereignty is increasingly appertaining to the European Union. At the end of 2000 in Nice, reinforced cooperation in the area of defence was still kept at bay, but today, there is ever growing consensus in this area. EU operations in Bosnia, Macedonia and eastern Africa have shown that Europe has a geopolitical responsibility. As the Brok report also clearly indicates, our own European headquarters are a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> for independent and efficient European defence.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me to be of major importance for more Member States, current and future ones, to join the European defence project of Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and France. Only in that way can a European force of this kind put an end to the useless duplication of defence efforts among Member States.

Instead, the EU should develop an alternative non-violent peace policy. Unfortunately, the Brok report is permeated by traditional over-confidence in military interventions as the only way of bringing about peace. Ought not the EU to learn from the United States’ failures in Afghanistan and Iraq? Ought not the European Parliament to remember its own decisions along different lines, for example the recommendation to the Council, adopted as long ago as 1999, to set up a European civil peace corps? The Council has ignored this recommendation for ten presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should also strongly support the promising talks now under way between the Beijing Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. It can do this by approving Amendment No 10 which repeats our old demand that the EU appoint a special representative for Tibet. Through the people with whom I am in touch as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with the People’s Republic of China and as a member of the European Parliament’s all-party Tibet Group, I have contacts in both quarters. I therefore know that both Beijing and the Dalai Lama would welcome a strong initiative from the EU on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Brok still fails to understand that the interests of the various European States differ, that their policies are consequently incompatible and that this common policy, which was established, it should be recalled, more than twelve years ago, under the Maastricht Treaty, is one of the hoariest of old chestnuts to have inspired the European federalist outlook. Rarely in history have so many eminent persons written so much and devoted so much energy to achieving this strange and pathological goal, which consists of ensuring that their country no longer exists. Most fortunately, however, these pipe dreams remain laughable and have still not been realised to any extent whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus for a moment on what these dreams are and what is so clearly going on here. They reveal an entire blueprint for the world and, I would even say, a genuine fear of the world. First of all, Mr Brok, who believes that the Council and the Commission are incapable of setting real priorities, takes it upon himself to perform this task, by deciding on what he calls, in Article 7, the ‘immediate external borders’, in other words the East and the South.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, he welcomes the fact that the crisis operations carried out under the common foreign policy have been supported by NATO’s planning and command structure – I am quoting here from Article 30 – and he advocates, of course, closer cooperation with NATO. What is the world-view that is being set out here? If the European Union has to implement its principle of ‘Strength through Unity,’ it must do so against the States located in its outermost regions, and closely related to this, must implement this principle, according to Mr Brok, through ever closer relations with the United States in the context of what he calls the ‘Euro-Atlantic Area’.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Europe would be constructed in such a way as to support the unity of the white developed world against everything that is different, everything that surrounds it and everything that it sees as a threat. Is this what the common foreign and security policy is, Mr Brok? How then can we expect people to believe that Europe’s goal is to counterbalance US power when its sole aim is clearly to strengthen the unity of the white world against a South that it perceives to be a threat? Can we not see that those singing the praises of the common foreign policy are also the greatest supporters of a wait-and-see policy and that the centre of this Euro-Atlantic area has never been more accurately called ‘the White House’ in other words, a house populated by whites, in league with one another, huddling together happily against the threats posed by the world. Well, ladies and gentlemen ...</p>

This was demonstrated yesterday by the visit to Teheran by the UK, German and French Ministers for Foreign Affairs, who obtained an agreement to the effect that Iran’s nuclear activities would be brought into line.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the Brok report views the CFSP too much in terms of constructing a unified entity, whereas it should really be seen in terms of variable geometry and of the synergy of national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">One could make the same reproach, although to a lesser degree, of the draft constitution currently being examined by the IGC. This provides for an official who would be responsible for external affairs in the Union, given the highly meaningful title of ‘minister’, supported by European diplomatic activity and wearing not two hats, as has been said, but three: that of High Representative for CFSP, that of Vice-President of the Commission for External Relations and that of President-in-Office of the ‘Foreign Affairs’ Council of Ministers.

The document has positive things to say on the wider Europe debate and new neighbours and, in particular, on the need to acknowledge the potential for full EU membership in future for those neighbours which are clearly European, namely Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. Today I welcome to the Parliament Mrs Timoshenka, a Ukrainian leader of the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">It emphasises cooperation in the areas of security and defence, which is excellent, only to spoil it, in my view, by regretting the continued unanimity principle and calling for QMV in foreign affairs, which would imperil national sovereignty. It rightly calls for strengthened EU and G8 measures again the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is arguably the biggest threat of all.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am less convinced of the need for an EU foreign minister or armaments agency and found the mini-defence union proposals of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Germany purely a piece of post-Gulf war anti-American posturing, which undermines NATO and is laughable without UK military participation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have concerns about the call for reforms of the UN. They are long overdue, but not if this means an EU seat replacing the UK's permanent seat. I have longed believed that there is a case to make for India as a permanent Security Council member and, possibly, also Japan and Brazil. I welcome the need for closer cooperation with Latin America in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have problems with including the ESDP in the Community budget, as defence policy is ultimately a marker of national sovereignty and can mean people dying for their country. It should therefore remain under national parliamentary scrutiny. Lastly, I have my doubts as to the necessity of a EUROMED Parliamentary Assembly and a EUROMED bank, which will be expensive. Besides, most of these countries are not true and fully functioning democracies with properly elected parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Intergovernmental Conference now going on will have to create structures that will make effective decision-making and action possible. Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, Javier Solana, deserves our support while he frames a strategy on which the Union’s foreign and security policy will be based. In a key role here will be the creation of a cordon of properly governed neighbouring countries on the Union’s external borders. The Commission proposal on the new neighbourhood policy is currently being debated by Parliament. It is a positive sign that future new Member States are actively working on the ‘Wider Europe’ initiative. We will need their skills, know-how and views in the development of relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for a common foreign and security policy being discussed by the IGC are a logical extension of the decisions reached at the Helsinki Summit on improving the EU’s crisis management capabilities. It has to be said, however, that we are still a long way from a situation where the EU could offer its Member States guarantees of military security. There is no need to take a negative view of the fact that some Member States are making faster progress in the area of defence cooperation than others. At the same time we have to insist that strengthened cooperation should be open to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of the creation of an international system based on multilateralism, as mentioned in Mr Brok’s report. Strengthening the role of the UN will be of key importance here. I am pleased that my own Group of the Party of European Socialists has now taken a very special approach to how to improve the way the UN performs.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilateralism also involves maintaining transatlantic relations. In the wake of the disagreements over the Iraq war we now must look ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group endorses the view put forward by the Commission in its excellent policy paper on the new relationship between the EU and China; we are also very grateful to the Council for having made its position clear as long ago as 13 October. Whilst we believe that the People’s Republic of China is a significant strategic partner for the European Union and that both sides should be committed to building up relations between them, we share the Council’s concern that the current human rights situation in China, especially where fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms are concerned, still does not meet the international standards that China itself acknowledges. This is particularly the case as regards Tibet. Like the Council, then, we call for serious dialogue to be commenced between central China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. Whilst unequivocally endorsing the ‘one China’ policy, we join with the Council in calling for a constructive dialogue to be commenced between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflicts across the straits must be resolved by peaceful means, and so the rockets – which could be seen as a threat – must be withdrawn from China’s coastal provinces. Parliament’s great interest in having closer relations with Taiwan, including in a multilateral framework, is a matter of record.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that this Sixth EU-China Summit on 30 October in Peking will be successful in the sense to which the Commission and the Council have referred in their statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, I wish you luck in what will be the first high-level meeting between representatives of the EU and China’s new leadership, in the hope that we will be able to make a new start on the basis that we have just discussed. All the best! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorism presents a threat from all states across the world, irrespective of religion. Racial prejudice undermines security and should play no part in our security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament seeks a role to support a stronger and more effective European Union common foreign and security policy, and I congratulate Mr Brok on the strong statements of principle in response to the annual report which he puts before us today. There is the need to strengthen transatlantic relations, to build EU defence capabilities in the context of reinforced cooperation between the EU and NATO and clear advocacy of the principle of multilateralism in international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I do not want to concentrate on already well-debated differences of view on issues in the resolution arising from the draft EU Constitution – the powers of the foreign minister, communitarisation, qualified majority voting, the creation of a separate EU defence headquarters or a duplicate solidarity clause for mutual defence. But I would stress to all Members that Parliament has already urged Member States to stick as close to the Convention draft as possible, and perhaps that discipline should apply to this House in making further demands now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to argue that, while supporting the wider Europe and new neighbours initiative, this must not be used to diminish Europe's global reach. In paragraph 8, is West Africa really more vital to the EU's interests than Central or southern Africa? Cannot European diplomacy be as important in resolving potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, as it is – we all dearly hope – in making progress in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I have never supported the principle of 'not in my back yard'. I join with colleagues in criticising those who would retreat from global responsibilities in international relations. That must include ensuring the European Union's political support for peace, democracy, human rights and development throughout our interdependent world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report makes many points and puts forward a vision of Europe’s role in international relations that we basically share. We also agree with its confirmation of multilateralism and the ranking of Europe’s priorities in foreign policy and even with the positions it adopts on the Middle East. If we had the time, I could give you many further examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, however, that I do wish to address, which is the issue of parliament’s rights in the field of foreign policy. Like you, I believe that the European Parliament should be better informed. This is stipulated in a recent agreement between the Council, the Commission and our House and it must be fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have some reservations, however, about the report’s more extreme demands. History has often shown that an effective foreign policy does not sit well with extended parliamentary powers. An assembly is a place of debate and discussion and, if necessary, of decision-making. Parliamentary time essentially extends over a long period whereas foreign policy must be conducted on a daily basis. Incidentally, Parliament is also, sometimes, a place of conflict between groups of necessarily differing opinions. I believe, however, that in terms of conducting its external policy, any community would benefit from demonstrating as much unity as possible. We also note that, in all democratic countries, the role of national parliaments in foreign policy follows particular rules.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is that enhancing parliamentary rights would not make Europe's foreign policy more comprehensible. Let us not produce some tangled web of additional competences that would further complicate the European public’s understanding of our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that, as regards the CFSP, I do not believe it would be a good idea to call for equal rights with the other EU institutions. Let us ask questions, let us make recommendations, if necessary, but let us not go so far as to call for the power to deliver opinions on matters of external policy. For the CFSP, as for other matters, furthermore, let us rely on the judicious recommendations of the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as Europe managed to provide itself with institutions capable of embodying its collective destiny, the war in Iraq laid bare the immense distance still to be travelled.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction in the draft Constitution of a new figure, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, with one, two or three hats, to borrow the colourful language of Mr Berthu, gives us cause for hope. Will this institution do its job? Will it enjoy effective powers? I certainly hope so. We cannot accept that European integration will contain two distinct and separate essences: an economic one which embraces integration, and a political one, in the stark, traditional sense, which clashes with it. This dichotomy does not really exist and has no part in the nature of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">If the question were put to them, the citizens of Europe would come out overwhelmingly in favour of common foreign and security policies. Legislators at European level, then, run no risk of being accused of taking up position in the vanguard, divorced from public opinion, advancing towards European defence and security. The citizens of Europe want to feel secure against the threat of violence, external or internal, but they do not want to be the vassals of any unilateral power, even if it appears in the guise of an ally. They may all dream of Immanuel Kant’s plan for perpetual peace, but they know that the road is hard and that, historically, naïve optimism has a high price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add that it is only the creation of civil society that will form a basis for democracy and security. Stability is brought about through the division of state and justice, and that is why it is difficult. It is obviously right and proper to underline the importance of the UN’s role in international conflicts. High-tech states can attack anywhere – and that has even happened and in even quite a rash way too. This way they themselves – or we ourselves – can create crises instead of providing solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion of a closed defence core is strange, puzzling and even frightening. What special form of insecurity has come about in those countries whose neighbours are other EU states? In my own country we have not been aware of any security deficit, even though we have a border with Russia more than 1 000 kilometres long and the Russians across that border outnumber the Finns 30 to one. Obviously, defence cooperation must be open to all who want it, just as economic and monetary union has been. The way we approach international problems has to be in the form of civil crisis management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that new threats and security risks must be combated, above all, by means of political strategies with a view to fighting poverty, protecting human rights and promoting democracy. That, in turn, requires efforts to discover conflicts in time and resolve them by political, diplomatic and economic means. The EU has these means available to it, and they – and not the military resources – should be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, share the view that the credibility of the EU’s foreign and security policy is dependent upon the EU’s military resources. Nor do I support increased cooperation within defence policy, which I believe should be subject to decisions on a unanimous basis. Nor am I able to support the proposal that common military operations must be funded via the Community budget and that the EU should, in the long term, acquire its own defence budget. Nor can I support the idea of a common military defence of European territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace-making operations, as discussed in paragraph 34, are measures in accordance with Article 7 of the UN Charter, that is to say direct military measures, and may only be taken following decisions by the UN Security Council. It is the EU’s task to prevent wars, not to make plans for conducting wars. Military defence is, and should be, a national issue. That is especially important for Sweden and other neutral countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
