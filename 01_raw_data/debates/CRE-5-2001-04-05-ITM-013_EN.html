<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, this report that I am presenting today to this House on safety in fisheries and the causes of fishing accidents analyses, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons for the high accident rate in this sector, and examines aspects such as the European legislative framework, the problems surrounding the work of fishermen and preventing risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the initiative to deal with this issue in Parliament came from the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, the work that is being presented to you today is the fruit of the work of many, including that of my colleagues, members of the Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament, who worked very hard with me, and who finally adopted this report unanimously. There was also the hearing with experts in September, the invaluable contributions that I received from officials from the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs and the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research and also the contributions made by the Advisory Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agreed on describing the job of fisherman (270 000 in the European Union) as a very dangerous profession, and also largely on the analysis of the reasons why fisheries has an accident rate that is up to 25 times higher than other economic sectors, and that one fisherman in seven in the European Union is involved in an occupational accident each year. This very high rate is due to a combination of very different causes: bad weather, long, very intense working days, payment systems, such as the so-called ‘catch-share payment’, which are not very comparable, a lack of collective negotiation, difficult working conditions, bad living conditions on board, isolation, separation from families and from the social environment, the remoteness of fishing grounds, the age of the fleet, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the sceptical position and fatalistic view of those who think that fishing accidents are inevitable and that the victims of them are a price we have to pay to the sea. I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them. We need to make safety a priority. We have unacceptable accident rates and we need to step up controls, raise awareness among ship owners and fishermen and, if necessary, encourage legislative changes in order to reduce them. We need to consider the social and labour conditions of seafarers and improve their working conditions, as they endure irregular rest times and working patterns based on working days of more than 14 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">This sector needs to be given a right to constant weekly and daily rest and, if necessary, the public authorities should intervene in order to impose what is the fundamental right of any worker. These hard working conditions mean, for example, that young people do not want to join the industry, which prevents the new generation from taking over.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to establish social dialogue in the sector, at European level, in order to reach collective agreements incorporating these issues of safety at work, consult more with the sector, provide those working in fisheries with social protection similar to that of other workers and develop a culture of safety among employers and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union does not even have statistical data; only five countries provide figures and they are not comparable. This issue should be taken into account when launching the third phase of the ‘European statistics on accidents at work’ project so that the Community can have reliable and complete data, harmonised at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has always thought that in this House we should talk not only about issues associated with fishing resources, but also about the human problems that affect seafarers. Therefore, my report asks that the conclusions reached should be included in the regulations on the reform of the CFP, so that the triangle made up of legislation, training and social dialogue can be included. I also urge the Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the international conventions and improve the Community directives which at this moment in time do not cover up to 90% of the fleet. I also point out in my report that flags of convenience do not provide work or safety guarantees to their crews, which entails serious risks for fishermen working on board these vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report about an issue that has not been dealt with so far. It is the first of these reports and will possibly be followed by second and third reports on accidents in fisheries. I hope that, as it is the first one, you will look tolerantly upon its defects and support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report. It is a very important initiative, because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole. Mrs Miguélez Ramos says that each year worldwide a great number of accidents take place and many are fatal. In the European Union alone more than 2 000 accidents occur every year. It will be impossible to decrease this number to zero due to the special features of the sector, but at least we should try and decrease the number of accidents as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This could be accomplished by improving some preconditions: first of all, better control on working conditions and safety on the fishing vessels that operate in the waters of the European Union. Furthermore, it is important to improve harmonisation and coordination between Member States as a whole. Regular controls on safety and working conditions should take place on all EU fishing vessels regardless of whether they are small, large, old or new. Besides this, further awareness regarding safety in the fisheries sector is necessary. Information campaigns and education are important tools to achieve this. Taking into account the increasing difficulties experienced throughout the EU in attracting young people for jobs at sea, the aspects of safety and working conditions should be given full attention. It is highly necessary to create a safety culture in this sector, so that all the interested parties know about the situation, which is very special, and respect their responsibilities. I, Albert Jan Maat, hope that this initiative report will be integrated in the discussion about the Green Paper and in the proposals for the new fisheries policy after 2002.'</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

History, chronicles and the literature of all maritime and fishing nations are full of references to acts of heroism, to suffering, to tragedies and shipwrecks at sea involving both small and large fishing boats.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing communities keep alive the memories of tragic events, which they pass on from generation to generation. Today, fortunately, modern technology can substantially reduce the danger, the uncomfortable conditions, accidents and shipwrecks. We now have the means to act, as long as there is the desire to act in this field. Mrs Miguélez Ramos’s report is one of the most useful, appropriate, intelligent and well-drafted own-initiative reports that I have had the task of reading and studying amongst the many own-initiative reports that abound in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an empty rhetorical exercise. It is an exemplary text and the rapporteur deserves our utmost praise and gratitude. I therefore support not only her diagnosis, but also all the proposals, recommendations, encouragement, suggested measures and warnings contained in the report and I fully agree with its motives. If the Commission and the Council give a favourable welcome to the content of the report and put it into practice, in a few years we will have fewer accidents, fewer deaths, fewer shipwrecks and less risk at sea. We will not, of course, be able to eliminate risk entirely, but the accident rate will be greatly reduced, fishing will take on a more human face and its workers will be given more dignity. Congratulations, Mrs Miguélez Ramos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Protection of resources is a priority objective of the CFP, which can under no circumstances be put before any measure that promotes the safety of fishermen, because this is a fundamentally false approach. There are many measures for maintaining and even reducing the fishing effort, while at the same time enabling living and safety conditions for crews to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are debating today, like all those that have been drawn up regarding safety, shows that the fact the fleet is so old is the main cause both of accidents on board and of sinking, and that sinking often has very serious consequences. The Commission’s plan to reserve the structural measures for the fleet almost exclusively for destroying it, while the surviving fleet is condemned to sail under increasingly precarious conditions, is therefore ridiculous. The only thing that is unfortunately achieved through this policy is that the Community fleet features more strongly in terms of accidents than in terms of savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, there is no point in having a battery of safety standards if it is not required that they are complied with. This is doubly concerning because the fact that this compliance has to be monitored and required makes us wonder what perception the sector has of its own safety. The last FAO report on the world state of fisheries and aquaculture says that a safe working environment is not something that can be imposed easily and that measures for improving safety can only be effective if there is the will to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to remember the responsibility that we all have as politicians, governments and fishermen, to end the fatalism that seems to surround this sector, a responsibility that cannot of course be escaped by the Commission or its narrow view on the modernisation of the fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would reiterate that, according to the International Labour Organisation, 24 000 sea fishermen die every year throughout the world – we do not, admittedly, have a global responsibility – as a result of accidents at sea. As a result of this report and also because of the timetable set out by the new fishing policy, we now have the opportunity to include this point in the Green Paper and we will later be able to include it in the common fisheries policy. This has been mentioned by numerous speakers and I think and hope that the Commission will include it. Since we obviously have no commitment to achieve specific results, we cannot do this, but we do have a commitment to resources in this matter, and we can make use of many of them. For example, I am thinking of direct legislation in the area of fishermen’s safety and safety at work, ship and equipment design or introducing rules for managing resources, which may have, and can have, implications for fishermen’s safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also urge ship-owners to make use of technological developments. We must always be at hand to help Member States and the fisheries sector to include these requirements in both initial and in on-going vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall conclude by repeating the simple terms that Mrs Miguélez Ramos suggested, that is, the safety culture – it should be used to the maximum. In this sector, there is a tradition of fatalism, which is related to the natural elements. We must fight against this tradition, in the name of the safety culture, because there is no reason why, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we cannot reduce the number of accidents at sea and the number of deaths amongst our fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, fishing is an activity which takes place in a naturally hostile environment, and is clearly associated with risk-taking. Risks are inherent in almost every decision made by a skipper or individual fishermen: on when and where to go fishing, what gear to use, when and where to land the catch, and so on. The level of marine accidents is unacceptably high. In the UK, for example, the fatality rate among fishermen is 20 times higher than that for workers in the manufacturing industry. Fishermen work in an unpredictable environment and are confronted with daily challenges from bad weather, fires on board, loss of power, poor vessel construction, poor communications and sometimes out-of-date navigation equipment. Casualties at sea have, unfortunately, become an integral part of the fishing profession. But the accident toll could undoubtedly be reduced if the fishing industry and individual fishermen, national authorities, the EU and international organisations faced this vital issue with enough thought, consideration, political will and economic means. I welcome this initiative, I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope that the Commission will follow up the recommendations in this report with positive action to improve safety and to reduce the number of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that safety be one of the key priorities in the forthcoming review of the CFP. It is essential that we do not create a management regime which forces fishermen to go to sea when the weather is bad, for example, in complying with days-at-sea restrictions or attempting to land fish in a designated port cut off by bad weather. High prices in periods of bad weather may also drive fishermen working under quota systems out on risky fishing trips, which may be the only way to obtain the best prices for what they land against their quotas. Such risks are preventable if safety forms an integral part of fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the recent developments in Scotland, where changes in fishermen's safety training mean that an age exemption for older catchers will be a thing of the past and that basic sea survival, first aid and survival training will soon be mandatory for all fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although a gradual ban on vessels more than 20 years old can be supported, the latter part of paragraph 4 in the report says, and I quote: ". . . except for those proven to be in perfect condition". It would be better if that section read: ". . . except for those that have passed annual safety tests". It is more practical to use that language than to open up a variable definition of perfect conditions. I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you read the frightening statistics at the beginning of her report which indicate that some 24 000 fishermen die each year throughout the world, the huge risks involved in working in this industry become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">This report calls for some radical proposals such as the call to introduce a gradual ban on vessels of 20 years of age or over, which my colleague Mr Hudghton has just mentioned, except where they have passed stringent annual safety checks. I support this proposition. Indeed such a policy might encourage participation in scrap-and-build programmes amongst those Member States which have traditionally refused to take advantage of cofinancing for such schemes, and the UK is a case in point. The UK fleet is now approaching an average age of 30 years and our fishermen are being forced to put to sea in vessels which are becoming increasingly risky and accident prone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to raise a couple of additional external factors which are not covered by the report but which the Commission may wish to consider. Too often recently, we have seen lives lost when fishing vessels engaged in a trawl have snagged their gear on undersea cables and other foreign objects on the seabed. There must be much more stringent regulation concerning the laying of undersea power and telecommunication cables or any foreign objects on the seabed where the lives of our fishermen might be endangered. Also there have been many cases of fishing vessels being dragged under or rammed by submarines. Only recently we had the tragic accident involving a US submarine and a Japanese training vessel where seven students lost their lives. There have been similar cases in Scottish waters in recent years. There must be better coordination between fishermen and naval personnel to ensure that such accidents can be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many fishermen think that learning to swim is a bad omen. Can I suggest that as part of the rigorous training qualifications that are being called for by Mrs Miguélez Ramos in this report, swimming qualifications would be necessary and would save many fishermen's lives every year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission entirely agrees with you. The safety of our fishermen must be given top priority. In the Green Paper on the future of the CFP, which I will shortly be presenting to Parliament, we have not forgotten this matter of concern and have thereby met one of your objectives, which you presented under paragraph 32 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1989, on the initiative of the Commission, the European Union has made every effort to improve the health and safety of workers in the fisheries sector. Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, together with the associated specific directives, offer a solid legal base. The following specific directives have also been issued: Directive 92/29/EEC on medical treatment on board, Directive 93/102/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels and Directive 97/70/EEC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.</p>
<p class="contents">According to your report, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, there are problems above all in two areas: firstly, the correct maintenance of vessels and, secondly, the working conditions, hygiene and the organisation of work on board. The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action. Having said that, we must note that more and more accidents are occurring in the fisheries sector. Just in the last few months, accidents have occurred which have led to a number of deaths. I would at this point like to express my deep condolences to the families affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with you fully. First of all, the Member States must also implement the provisions of the directives. As far as your conclusions are concerned, Madam Rapporteur, I feel there is a need to act in the following areas. The first area has to do with the legal framework, which is covered in paragraphs 1 to 3 and paragraph 27 of your report. The applicable directives are essentially adequate but they are just minimum requirements, and there is nothing to prevent the Member States from issuing stricter rules or establishing special requirements for specific cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the directives contain a reporting duty for the Member States with different timetables. With the help of these national reports, in 2002 the Commission will compile a summary report and, where necessary, table amendments. In preparation for this, we have started to amend Directive 97/70/EEC to ensure the harmonised interpretation of the Annexe to the Torremolinos International Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area relates to the vocational and continuing training of workers, which is covered by paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 26 and 30. The directives already contain articles on the vocational training of workers. Here too, however, we are dealing with minimum requirements. It therefore once again lies with Member States to see to it that they are implemented and, if needs be, to bring about higher standards. I can assure you, however, that the Commission will make the vocational and continuing training of workers in matters of safety one of the central issues in its forthcoming report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the best rules are useless if they are not complied with correctly or at all. Monitoring and control are the main problems. But these fall exclusively within the remit of the Member States. We must therefore urge them to apply the provisions correctly. Moreover, objective, reliable and comparable data on the causes and circumstances of accidents are a prerequisite for successful prevention. In this regard, there is already an initiative on the harmonisation of data in the competent departments of Eurostat and also in the Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fleet renewal, I would like to remind you that one of the objectives of all the structural programmes in the fisheries sector is to modernise fishing vessels. In the context of the financial instrument on structural assistance in the fisheries sector, there are abundant resources available to improve safety on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the international part of the CFP, the Commission has always insisted on compliance with the rules in force. Safety and health on board vessels are part and parcel of our overall strategy both in the bilateral agreements and in the regional fisheries organisations, as well as in the fight against illegal fishing and flying flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, I can agree with you fully. All of us – the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Member States and international organisations – must do our outmost to ensure that the risk for our fishermen is reduced to an absolute minimum. Your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal.</p>
