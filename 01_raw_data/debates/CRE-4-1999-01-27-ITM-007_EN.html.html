<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to report to you today on the results of the climate negotiations in Buenos Aires and the follow‐up work for the coming months. Parliament has put forward a very interesting resolution and I note with satisfaction that we are agreed on the great majority of points. My assessment of the Buenos Aires conference is also that it was a success, although the overall result was limited.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with the Community achieved its minimum objective, namely a Plan of Action with a Work Programme for concrete decisions on outstanding issues arising from the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention, which as you know will be taken up by the Sixth Conference of the Parties in less than two years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU played an important role in getting the G77 countries and China to the negotiating table, so that they could feel more closely involved in the process. I continue to focus on better relations with the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the Fifth Conference of the Parties, not least by prioritising the practical formulation of the mechanism for sustainable development, the Clean Development Mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a commitment on the part of the Argentinian Presidency to strengthen political control of the process by holding ad hoc meetings at ministerial level in the enlarged Executive Committee between annual meetings of the Conference of the Parties. I believe that such ad hoc meetings are crucial in keeping the process on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, therefore, I think that the Fourth Conference of the Parties succeeded in making good progress towards implementing the Kyoto Protocol. As regards the individual parts of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, I have the following comments to make: we have some hard work ahead of us in formulating detailed rules on the mechanisms, in particular because monitoring and recording are needed in order to prevent these mechanisms from being used as loopholes in the environmental legislation. I therefore think it important that a decision should be taken at the Sixth Conference of the Parties on the three mechanisms together, so that the package will include a strong and cohesive system for monitoring the mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to continue the debate on how we can achieve the Convention's final objective, namely to prevent dangerous climate change, at the same time ensuring that the burdens are shared fairly and taking into account our common but differentiated responsibilities. I call upon honourable Members to consider how we can best resolve this difficult question, especially having regard to the reluctance of the developing countries to take part in discussions on their own obligations, which was in fact again clearly demonstrated at the Fourth Conference of the Parties. It is important that we do further work on implementing policies and measures to combat climate change, not just at international level but to an even greater degree in the EU and hence in the Member States. I also agree with Parliament that we must concretise how we can achieve our aims, since good intentions are certainly not enough. The Commission, Parliament and the Council must take their responsibilities seriously and come up with concrete actions and decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I stress that some important proposals have been presented which require a decision, for example the proposal on taxation of energy products. I strongly urge Parliament to deliver its opinion on this proposal before the parliamentary elections, so that the new momentum from the German Presidency can be used to advantage and so that political agreement can be reached at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council in May.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of taxation, our first objective must be to ensure that the proposal on taxation of energy products is adopted, since an increasing number of Member States now seem to agree that such taxation is necessary. If the German Presidency does not succeed in bringing about agreement – which I certainly hope it will – we can still consider what we can do with the proposal for a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax, which was originally presented in 1992 and which, as you know, has not been withdrawn by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Plan of Action and the internal policies and measures, our aim is that the Kyoto Protocol should be ratified and take effect as quickly as possible. I am strongly in favour of speedy ratification. But this means that we must put our own house in order, so that ratification will not be just an empty gesture. In this context, the more proactive stance of certain American industrial interests in the effort to combat climate change and the signature of the Protocol by the USA can be regarded as positive steps. There were signs in Buenos Aires of a more positive attitude on the part of certain sections of the American Congress. But the goal has still not been attained, far from it, and honourable Members have a valuable role to play in continuing – as they did in Buenos Aires – to persuade their colleagues in the American Congress that the Protocol must be ratified. Here I have to say that I am sceptical with regard to declarations from Argentina and Kazakhstan signalling their willingness to enter into a binding commitment at the Fifth Conference of the Parties. In the long term it is important that the developing countries should be involved, but the real test of such voluntary commitments is their final effect in practice. In order that a country can take advantage of the benefits of the Protocol, it must sign it. It must also honour in full the obligations it has thereby taken upon itself. Moreover, we must – as we have said before – ensure that we do not just get more hot air into the system through having unambitious objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me come back to our internal programme of work. As I already announced in September, I shall be presenting a communication in the spring of 1999. This undertaking was welcomed by the European Council in Vienna, which concluded that it would take a decision on the basis of a report from the Commission on a comprehensive EU strategy for climate policy at its meeting in Cologne which, as you know, will be held at the beginning of June. I entirely agree that we need a comprehensive EU strategy. The year 2008 looks far ahead in the future, but we must act now if we are to have any chance of achieving our objective. In the Commission communication therefore, we will concentrate on those elements that are crucial to ensuring that the EU can achieve its objectives. These key elements include common and coordinated policies and measures, the Kyoto mechanisms and links with third countries. The communication will contain a full analysis of the effects of the trade in emission rights, common implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism. I assure you that I will do my utmost to expedite the adoption of this communication so that it can be presented promptly and be ready for the Cologne summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will say in closing that, generally speaking, I can support Parliament's resolution and I look forward to further very constructive cooperation in our common effort to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graenitz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, may I remind the Commissioner that, according to one of our sayings, words and deeds are often oceans apart. If we want to keep to the timetable that was drawn up in Buenos Aires and if we want to draw up our own timetable for that purpose, we shall have to cross those oceans together in the fastest possible time with the firmest measures we can implement, otherwise we shall be left sitting helplessly on one shore as the climatic disaster breaks out on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is essential, Commissioner, to do a number of things at international level. One of these – and a very important one too – is to continue the dialogue with the developing countries that was so productive in Buenos Aires so that we can develop the proposals for the clean development mechanism together with these countries. I also believe that, even though we have had little joy on this from the outset, we in the European Union must come up with some very specific proposals as to how emissions trading should ultimately work, how monitoring can be carried out and how individual emissions and reductions in emissions are to be assessed, so that we are armed with this information when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is essential to incorporate these issues more effectively into our strategies for negotiating the accession of the applicant countries to an enlarged Union. In Kyoto, the countries whose applications are being considered for accession in the first wave undertook to make the same reductions in emissions as the Member States of the European Union. The crux of the matter now, however, is to involve them in the preparation process, so that we do not have a situation in which they accede to membership of the Union without having made the necessary preparations and therefore cannot be integrated into the European system of burden‐sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">I think some of my colleagues will want to deal in greater detail with European burden‐sharing. I only wish to say that, besides the coordination of national plans, it will also be necessary to ensure that we have the required legal bases at EU level and that we create such bases wherever they are lacking, because unless we pool our efforts we shall not achieve the goal we set ourselves in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that these measures will have to be accompanied by the development of safeguards in the areas of health, agriculture and ecological protection, because as the change in climate becomes ever more apparent, dangers will emerge that we may never have contemplated. It is my belief that, as we prepare to enter the new millennium, we now have the opportunity to achieve sustainable development, rapid technological progress and above all a fairer distribution of the world's resources, and I hope we have the strength and the courage to grasp that opportunity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spencer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, before I speak to the resolution, can I clear up a translation error. In the English interpretation of what the Commissioner said, reference was made to the withdrawal by the Commission of the CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax. In fact, you were much wiser than that. You did not withdraw the proposal, you amended it, and that amended proposal is still on the table and I hope the Council will take it up. I trust that all the language versions will be consistent with what you actually said. I am grateful for a copy of the text in English.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the honour to lead Parliament's delegation to the Buenos Aires Conference and the report from myself and other colleagues is available to Parliament. In my view, COP IV was a moderate success dragged screaming from the jaws of what might have been a negotiators' deadlock. The Buenos Aires Action Plan promises some progress by the time of COP VI in the year 2000. For the first time it reflects interest in the principles of contraction and convergence and of global equity which this Parliament has voted for regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">My report draws attention to the helpful and positive role of the Commission in Buenos Aires for which I am grateful and for the courtesy which it showed towards Parliament. My report also draws attention to the failure of the Council either to recognise, to use, or intelligently to consult MEPs during the course of the Conference. The latest Council guidelines on MEP involvement, decided on a week before Buenos Aires, are positively insulting to Parliament. I have raised the matter with the President and I hope that the Committee on Institutional Affairs would look at this in the context of the next IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union learnt the lessons of our relative failure in Kyoto and reached out towards countries in the Group of 77, looking for allies in the cause of sanity in protecting the climate of the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use my last few seconds to make an appeal to the Commission. Despite what the Commissioner said about the possibility of political progress between COPs, I should like to encourage the idea of a structural review of the whole process of the Conference of the Parties. In my view at the moment it is far too prone to technical logjams stopping political initiatives. The rhythm of the Conference of the Parties makes it difficult to take political initiatives between conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Bonn yesterday talking to Michael Zammit‐Cutajar of the Climate Change Secretariat and I suggested to him that maybe the time had come for a structural review of the way we organise this whole process, perhaps using our old tried and trusted friend the Group of Wise Men – or Eminent Persons or whatever we call it nowadays – to stand back from the detailed negotiations and look at the destination of this process. It seems to me, having been to all these COPs, that we are caught now between this being a continuing and at times difficult negotiation and, at the same time, being an institution with administrative responsibilities. I hope the Commission will take up this suggestion. I thank the Commissioner for her statement and I commend the resolution to the House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kestelijn‐Sierens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to claim that Buenos Aires was really a success. Whilst the Kyoto talks managed to agree on a reduction of greenhouse gases, regrettably no detailed rules were agreed on how exactly this should be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that the Union has done what it could, and I warmly congratulate Commissioner Bjerregaard on her hard work and determination. We have the Buenos Aires action plan and we should give this our full attention, because important decisions will have to be taken at the climate conference in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise two points. Firstly, if the Kyoto protocol is to come into force, it has to be ratified by at least 55 of the parties which account for at least 55 % of all emissions. We must keep hammering home the point that it is essential for the USA to ratify. If the biggest polluter – the USA – and Russia do not ratify, for example, then Kyoto is meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that emissions trading can only be allowed if the bulk of the effort is made at national level. I quite agree with Commissioner Bjerregaard that we must set a ceiling on emissions trading. We must not, so to speak, export the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The positions of the Union and the USA are diametrically opposed to one another here. The Union rightly maintains that action to combat climate change only makes sense if everyone plays their part. And this has always been the position of Parliament, even if it is not explicitly stated in the resolution now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the harmonised energy tax, we too are in favour of a tax of this kind, but provided it is fiscally neutral. Our group has tabled two amendments calling for a harmonised tax, and they should be understood in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last question to the Commissioner. Where does she stand on the question of a possible tax on aviation fuel, to be introduced at European level? There are those who say, perhaps rightly, that the answer lies in better technology so that the level of emissions is reduced. But the increase in air transport means that measures will definitely be needed in this area too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">González Álvarez </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, how can one fail to agree with the Commissioner when she proposes specific measures, follow‐up procedures, cooperation with developing countries and taxation in connection with the production of energy? I am sure we all agree with her, particularly as she has put forward specific measures to ensure that what has been agreed is carried through. According to scientific opinion and to the United Nations" report, 50 000 deaths and losses totalling 12 billion pesetas were caused by natural disasters in 1998. I do not myself believe these disasters were all that natural. I am not sure what the losses amount to in euros, but 12 billion pesetas is certainly a lot of money.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are a lot of economic powers and governments that should be taking appropriate action, if only because of the economic consequences of these natural disasters. We, however, are going further, and we truly believe the European Union"s proposal was the best, despite being rather cautious. The European Parliament has expressed this view on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientists also tell us that emissions must be brought down to between 50 % and 60 % of their 1990 levels, if we are to have a positive impact on climate change. We are aiming at an 8 % reduction in the emission of six greenhouse gases. If we do not even achieve that 8 % reduction, we shall be endangering the future of the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome your proposals, Commissioner, provided you do ensure that the Member States comply with them. In particular, we should like to see the load spread fairly between industrialised and developing countries. We are opposed to the idea of making developing countries start to pay, as the United States would have them do. It is for us to pay.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fitzsimons </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I was part of the delegation with Mr Spencer and Mr Linkohr at the conference in Buenos Aires. How one judges the conference is a matter of opinion. Mr Spencer said it was a moderate success. I think that is a fair description. I recall Commissioner Bjerregaard saying at the press conference at the end that we would have wanted to achieve more, that we always do, but that this was as much as we could persuade the other parties to the conference to agree to. The European Union showed real leadership, supported to a large extent by the candidate countries, the G77 and China.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recall the President‐in‐Office of the Council saying that at Kyoto we agreed on concrete reduction targets and greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries. In Buenos Aires we kept the momentum of Kyoto by establishing the action plan which was one of the objectives of Buenos Aires and deciding on other measures like the elaboration of a compliance system.</p>
<p class="contents">The international press treated the conference with a certain amount of cynicism; some called it a fiasco. It was a difficult conference because there were long, tortuous and turgid negotiations but I cannot but support Mr Spencer and congratulate the Commission. I also applaud the decision by the United States to sign the protocol. While recognising that it may be a diplomatic formality, as we say in the resolution, at the same time it is very effective and signals a change of opinion in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also applaud the COP IV host countries, Argentina and Kazakstan for signalling their willingness to enter into a binding commitment at COP V to reduce their greenhouse emissions further. That is progress of some sort, small though it may be. So, it is a good resolution. I support it as does my group and, along with Mr Spencer, I commend it to the House.</p>

But at the same time the fact remains, and it gets ever more embarrassing from one day to the next, that the Union has not been able to take any decisions of its own which would lead to establishing its own commitments too. For that reason it is vital that we debate the issue of energy taxation, something the Commissioner mentioned earlier. It is also important that those countries that wish to go further than others can, in addition, adopt this original proposal for a carbon dioxide and energy tax. It would be interesting to hear what estimates the Commission might have here. We must remember that the Treaty of Amsterdam makes provision for a situation where some countries can move forward more swiftly than others, if those others are not ready. But I am sure that industry has also realised that climate policy can give it a competitive edge, and this should be seized upon.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weber </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, was Buenos Aires a flop? I do not think so. It was not a flop, it just suffered from the last night at Kyoto when the Americans tried to introduce flexible mechanisms into the protocol without which they were not going to sign up. It must also be said that the Conference President did not show the same diplomacy as Ambassador Estrada, who led the proceedings at Kyoto extremely well, but that is just a minor detail.</p>
<p class="contents">My group agrees with the idea of pursuing a 50/50 position in the flexible mechanisms. This means that at least 50 % of the reductions must be made at home before the flexible mechanisms may be used. The European Union must continue to support this position.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with the introduction of the flexible mechanisms, which will finally allow the cost of emitting one tonne of carbon to be calculated in economic terms. This will have repercussions on the tax systems of the industrialised countries which are included in Annex I. I particularly dislike the pressure put by the developed countries, in particular the USA, on the developing countries to undertake to reduce their emissions too. It must be said that the developing countries, which are non‐Annex I countries, do not even have any quota to sell under Article 6. I recall a comment by the Chinese delegate at Kyoto, who said that the Americans have three cars per family whereas the Chinese go to work on foot and yet the Americans and the Europeans want to stop the Chinese from going to work on the bus. We must be serious about this and rather more flexible with regard to the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to a subject of great interest to me, which is forestry. The Kyoto Protocol stipulates that funding can be granted for reforestation, particularly for carbon sequestration and especially within the CDM or Clean Development Mechanism. This can play an important role in allowing the industrialised countries to support and provide funding for reforestation projects in developing countries. The NGOs concerned with the protection of the environment point out that it is essential that only projects which respect biodiversity are subsidised. We must ensure that projects for intensively managed plantations are not subsidised at the expense of protecting biodiversity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the outcome of the 1997 Kyoto conference on climate change was rightly seen as a turning‐point, albeit only a first step in the right direction. It represents a first attempt to reduce greenhouse gases and so halt the progress of man‐made changes to the world"s climate. It is most important that the Kyoto Protocol should be speedily ratified by all the parties, notably the United States and Russia. Pressure is building towards this, particularly amongst business circles in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that much remained to be done after Kyoto in terms of concrete follow‐up. The follow‐up conference in Buenos Aires has resulted in a single programme of action with pledges and timetables. That was a welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents">Much consideration must also be given to dialogue with the developing world. But there is a danger that it may be restricted to the conclusion of agreements on emissions trading. Firstly, in my view, the European Union itself must work to cut greenhouse gas emissions within the EU. It is also very important to assist other countries, for example by the transfer of cleaner technology which can be provided through development aid. It may be that emissions trading takes place within the continent of Europe. Emissions trading will only take place with countries outside Europe if those countries actually take steps to reduce greenhouse gases. If countries within the EU itself make an effort, this may encourage non‐European countries to play their own part in cutting emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this reduction in emission levels, environmental policy needs to be incorporated into other policy sectors, such as energy, transport and agriculture. Appropriate ways to do this are the promotion of efficient energy use, renewable energy and energy taxes. Once again, I would advocate the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, our responsibility for these issues is a shared one, but each individual country has an individual responsibility to contribute to resolving the problems too. The individual citizen likewise has an individual responsibility. So work is needed to create a worldwide awareness of the fact that things cannot go on this way and that a new model of sustainable economic development is needed, based on respect for the natural world and its Creator.</p>

An effective policy on the global climate will not be achieved until the real cost of emitting active substances into the atmosphere is borne in full by the polluter. For that to happen, we need a suitable legal framework. The oft‐repeated excuse that reducing emission levels is too expensive is suicidal. A society that is unwilling to invest in the preservation of its own vital resources, and hence in the survival of the human species, is doomed to extinction. The emissions catalogue that was negotiated in Buenos Aires is no way to tackle the problem. In the long run, problems can only be solved at the point where they actually occur.</p>

That is the one ray of sunshine. But when we compare our declarations of intent with the actual outcome, the picture begins to cloud over. I shall simply use the figures I have obtained from the Commission. Total CO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions in the European Union rose by 2 % between 1990 and 1996. In 1997 there was a small reduction, but the winter weather was mild in 1997, and there is nothing to suggest that we have wrought any fundamental changes. The reduction we saw in the first half of this decade, which has now given way to further increases, can be explained away. We replaced coal with gas. We replaced oil with gas. As a result of German reunification, an entire region was deindustrialised. In addition, existing plants were modernised. These are processes that will not be repeated. In other words, accelerated economic growth in particular means that, by the year 2000, we must expect CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions to be higher – and indeed measurably higher – than their 1990 levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me cite the example of my own federal state of Baden‐Württemberg; it is quite a highly industrialised state. Since 1995, per capita CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions have risen considerably there as a result of economic growth. So the tide is definitely not turning. That makes us stop and think. Now of course we can say, 'Very well, we need to try harder' and so on. But we have tried harder in some respects, as a result of which – and these too are Commission figures – there has been an average annual increase in energy efficiency of only 0.6 % since 1990, whereas 2 % increases were being achieved in the eighties and the late seventies.</p>
<p class="contents">That too makes us stop and think. It implies that we are capable of achieving less now than we could manage ten or fifteen years ago. What we need – and this is addressed to the Commission and more especially, of course, to the Council – is an action plan with measurable targets. I should really like to know exactly what each country and each industry has to do, what is expected in terms of transport policy and even what households should be doing. Above all, we have to ask ourselves how this can be funded. So how can it be funded? And this brings me to my final recommendation to the Commission. Put something on the table here; suggest a way to reach agreement with the banks so that investments in the energy sector can be prefinanced, because funds are not being advanced at the present time for energy investments, and I believe this is the main reason why we are not making progress. The technology is generally there, but the money is not!</p>

I want to start by thanking the Commission and particularly the Commissioner for their work and personal commitment and also for the way in which, in Buenos Aires, they received and worked with the representatives of this House. Unfortunately, the Council adopted an attitude which it cannot maintain. In institutional terms, Parliament must now adopt a position in relation to the Council and each of the Presidencies, and before the next intergovernmental conference at that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of my speech is connected with what Mr Linkohr said about policies and measures. My concern is that reductions are not being made in many areas of the EU and in the majority of the world"s countries. In Portugal, for example, electricity consumption grew by 6 % last year, which was double the growth in production. It is clear that this cannot go on.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission"s intention to prepare a directive – which I would like to see as soon as possible – in order to establish certain compulsory minimum levels of penetration of renewable energy. We have spoken to Commissioner Papoutsis and we agree that the directive is urgently needed. The penetration of renewable energy in the market has been shrinking because of the fall in the price of oil and natural gas, and also given that the cost of energy does not currently include environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have the Structural Funds and the European transport network which are areas over which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has some influence through the budget. The Member States must be forced to use this money to consider transport options which consume less energy.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the applicant countries, PHARE and TACIS now have no influence over their energy consumption. If this situation continues, Mr Linkohr"s prediction will come true: as soon as the acute crisis has ended, emissions will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must say that the Commission could perhaps support the initiatives of certain companies such as BP and others, which are assuming positive attitudes towards climate change, by organising a major event in Brussels on the positive role that could be played by companies prepared to take this issue seriously.</p>

I believe the issue today is a different one. It is about the need for the European Union to take the lead here. To put it plainly, loopholes in the Protocol such as the scope for emissions trading must not be used as a means of wriggling out of responsibility. Which takes us straight to this question: what has happened to the promised measures? I should also like to hear from you exactly what is to happen now with regard to the implementation of the White Paper on renewable energy sources? You referred to the key role that the energy tax is to play. All right, we now have a proposal on an energy consumption tax, but that is surely a tiny step. After all, the Commission itself has admitted that the implementation of this proposal will not prevent a 6 % increase in emission levels by the year 2010. What did you say about the most intractable problem of all, namely transport? We know that CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions by vehicles are set to rise by 38 % between now and 2010. Here too, I would ask you to answer the questions my fellow Members have been asking. When will kerosene finally be taxed?

We seem to do quite a lot of wringing our hands about the Council's reluctance to agree an energy tax and other fiscal measures. I agree with the Commissioner that it is time the Commission put its own house in order on climate change. I want to hear some detailed commitments that this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Early in the debates we heard some nice aspirations about sustainable agriculture and I applaud that. However, I want to ask the Commission what action it is taking to green its approach to the single market, to the way it is implemented and to the way competition policy works, to the way in which it spends overseas aid, to its policy on trade, to its accession negotiations, which a lot of colleagues have mentioned, and the structural funds as well as the CAP. We need to see active implementation on strategic environmental assessment with an eye to climate change and to use this as a tool for assessment of policy at European level, especially external aid as well as policy here in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need more work on exactly what clean development technology transfer will consist of and the relationship with our overseas development assistance. Active implementation of CDMs is going to be pivotal to winning the support we need for the Kyoto protocol from the developing countries. Without some support from them for the notion of equity, we will continue to have problems trying to get America to ratify.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can make progress on some of these issues, the European Union could go forward with confidence to set the tone for COPs V and VI. Certainly we know that climate change is not going away and it certainly will not go away because of the text that Parliament is going to vote tomorrow. The United States is not going to ratify simply because we asked it to. This week the Environment Ministers are down in the Antarctic watching how it is melting away, looking at what the problems are going to be. We need some kind of commitment from the Commission and I hope that we will hear the Commission and the Council ensure that the European Union takes the necessary action to deal with the points I have raised as well as the perennial favourites of energy taxes.</p>

Every country in the world is tangibly affected. Emissions do not pose a threat in the short term, but in the long term they are infinitely more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">The first hesitant steps towards a negotiated solution have been accomplished with a certain amount of pain. Since the commitment which has to be made can impinge noticeably on a nation's finances, it is essential to find solutions which benefit the environment at the lowest possible cost. There is no doubt that trade in emission levels provides such a solution. Therefore, in my view, it is absolutely crucial for the Commission to carry out a wide‐ranging study into how this instrument should be used to ensure that the problem of climate change is dealt with in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">Research carried out in Scandinavia shows that trade in carbon dioxide emissions in the Nordic countries would cut costs by 50 %. Although a reduction in emissions may be hard to verify, the research shows that the benefits of a successful outcome are so substantial that a huge effort needs to be made to establish a sustainable system.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be in the EU's best interests not to unilaterally adopt economic instruments which have the effect of substantially increasing costs, for example in comparison with the USA, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. In future negotiations, we should put right some of the mistakes that were made at Kyoto. For the sake of the future, we should not dismiss economically sound methods which have shown themselves to be effective. The phasing‐out of nuclear power would lead to serious problems if it became a reality. Instead, this excellent source of energy should be developed and improved.</p>

First, it covers funding mechanisms to help developing countries face the challenges linked to climate change. Secondly, it covers future work on policies and measures to be implemented which are already on the agenda for the next conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention. Thirdly, it covers the development and transfer of clean technologies, which will help developing countries not to repeat the environmental blunders the developed countries have made, and fourthly, it covers the basic rules for the flexibility mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol, although agreement needs to be reached on an institutional structure for these.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Members who have said that dialogue is fundamental, but I also want to mention that, in just two months, the Joint ACP‐EU Assembly, which has a working group on climate change in small island states, will not only be adopting a highly important resolution for the developing countries but will certainly be making a statement after two years of work. I would therefore like to ask Mrs Bjerregaard why on earth we have received no satisfactory response from the Commission when, for example, we have highlighted the importance of acting in synergy with other Directorates‐General, such as DG VIII and DG XI, on science, research and development. We are extremely concerned for the ACP countries and we have called for a disaster prevention fund because we believe the small island states are extremely vulnerable to climate change. So I would ask the Commissioner either to respond here and now or to let those of us who are working in very close synergy have some answers as soon as possible. This is becoming crucial for us because the crises occurring in Africa and the ACP island states are leading to grave disasters.</p>

In the course of the debate, I have heard a number of suggestions as to how we can do more to persuade the other parties to become more actively committed to the line that we have taken. So I entirely share the view of Mrs Graenitz that it is important for us to continue the international effort, not least in relation to the developing countries. I agree with Mrs Graenitz and others that the applicant countries must be more closely involved. I think it was Mr Pimenta who also stressed this point. It is what we are trying to do all the time. It is also what we did in Buenos Aires but clearly, on the point of energy policy and its consequences, there is a great deal still to be done in relation to the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Spencer was quite right about the interpreting error – that happens from time to time when one speaks a minor language – so I am happy to confirm that what I said was that the CO<span class="sub">2</span> levy, which had originally been proposed in 1992, was not withdrawn by the Commission. I also think we have good reason to consider how we organise the process. We had some discussion of this in Buenos Aires. I also mentioned that the continued Argentine Presidency had plans for a more political process, but I am happy to take part in discussions on other ways of tackling it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hautala stressed – and I think quite rightly – that we must meet our own objectives. If we want to stick to the line we have embarked upon, then we must also be in a position to see it through to the end, and that is indeed what we intend to do, both by presenting a communication and also by taking the matter up at Council meetings. In other words, the Commission must come up with a further plan, which I will be happy to discuss with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of a flight tax or a kerosene tax, which we have discussed once or twice, is somewhat more difficult. We have also taken this up in a number of forums. The last occasion on which I myself pressed very hard for it was at a meeting we had under OECD auspices with the environment ministers. It was very clear that there was powerful opposition from the USA, Canada, Japan and others, so the question is whether something can be done at European level, because the opposition at international level is formidable.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mrs Pollack's view that there are a great many areas we must tackle. There will be some initiatives on the internal market. Later in the year, I think, we shall have an opportunity to discuss the problems relating to the WTO. I think Parliament may remember that there was a joint communication from Sir Leon Brittan and myself, and we certainly intend to continue this cooperation up to the forthcoming WTO negotiations. Fortunately, I can say that the German Presidency has included the proposal on strategic environmental assessment on its prioritised list, so it is also my hope that we can make further progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there may well be many things we need to discuss, but let me close by thanking Parliament for its support for the line we have embarked on. I look forward to the continuation of that cooperation. We really need all our forces if we are to convince the other parties that we have set the right course.</p>
