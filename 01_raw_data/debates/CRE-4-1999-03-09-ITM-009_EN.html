<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Needle </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, the development of the European public health policy has now reached a very important stage. This welcome Commission communication identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the first framework period, which is now coming to a close, and points to both the challenges and opportunities which can be foreseen, offering a positive and clear new framework. This Parliament has a strong reputation for promoting the protection and improvement of public health and, as I will indicate later, we ourselves can still improve.</p>
<p class="contents">Many distinguished Members of this House have been prominent in ensuring that the European Union has a role in health policy, to say nothing of the established and growing part it now plays in research or food safety, environmental policies, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point to make is that the Amsterdam Treaty thoroughly enshrines that role by declaring in the new Article 152 that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities. The rest of the article is far from perfect, but provides the basis for some serious work over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">How should that work be organised? I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has achieved a broad consensus that the way forward is via clearly focused priorities which offer added value to the work of partners in Member States, agencies such as the World Health Organization, and non‐governmental organisations. That will require the Council, the Commission and Parliament to do two things at the crucial next stage, when the three newly identified strands of information, rapid response, promotion and prevention are translated into new horizontal action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is time for bold thinking. The interpretation of the draft Treaty will be vital and, if the benefits of new technologies, skills, knowledge and freedoms are to be realised by European citizens, there will have to be a political and administrative willingness to move forward. In this I refer particularly to the need to share information on best practices – we have to be prepared to address common and specific problems transparently and honestly – and to the recent judgments in the European Court of Justice regarding cross‐border access to medical products.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have in mind the need to address health factors which are exacerbated by decisions within the EU. A great many of our citizens regard the situation whereby we introduce anti‐cancer or cardiovascular disease programmes alongside support for tobacco producers to be nonsensical. I fear we are going to repeat that error in another report later this week.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work to end that in a sensible way. I would ask the Commission today to tell us of its strong support for proposals which are imminent on combating tobacco consumption. We also need to make sense of often conflicting information on diets and nutrition – I suspect that is of interest to the Commissioner and myself in particular – and to develop coherent new food policies on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">That leads to the second requirement, which is one of responsibility. At the very time we are seeking these steps forward, the non‐governmental organisations which play a leading part in sustaining and nurturing public, professional and political awareness of health issues are being faced with potentially damaging budget cuts. It is not acceptable for the budgetary authorities to be so out of step with previously agreed commitments, but it also demonstrates that we must all face up to some tough choices. That is why clear and decisive prioritisation of future programmes will be essential, matched by a clear and certain simplified budgetary procedure. That is why we not only support the move away from small vertical programmes to horizontal strands but also seek a vastly more integrated approach, based around an identifiable single health directorate so that health truly becomes an integral part of the EU process, at its very heart.</p>
<p class="contents">That means appropriate health impact assessments, starting with the Commission's own programmes, and proportionately more officials with the appropriate expertise, as identified in the excellent study carried out by Parliament's services in support of our well‐received public hearing last October. It means partnership at all levels to tackle the greatest public needs and health inequalities most effectively, not least in the current process of enlargement of the Union, where a much‐needed further Commission text is imminent.</p>
<p class="contents">With its report, Parliament has responded thoroughly, responsibly and with vision to help establish a sound framework for progress. In 13 tightly‐argued recommendations, we have made a cogent case for a new priority for health as part of a European decade for health, which will truly begin to meet the real needs of our citizens. But it is the next step in the new Parliament which will determine whether we have the courage and determination to turn those aims into reality by ensuring the major chronic diseases of this century do not bedevil the next.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish by thanking all those who have contributed to the communication and to the publication of this report and have worked so hard to take EU health policies to this stage from where we can look forward confidently to the road ahead.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marinucci </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, one of the hardest things to explain to Europeans, when one meets them privately or at public debates, is that the Community has no real competence over health. The public wonder how it can be that a supranational entity, which has equipped itself with a single currency and been extremely successful in securing peace, progress and well‐being for its citizens, does not concern itself with health and is confined just to the limited scope offered at long last by the Maastricht Treaty and reinforced by the Amsterdam Treaty. As we all know, the Treaty of Rome made no provision at all in this area. It is hard to explain. It is also hard, on the other hand, to expect countries to surrender sovereignty over their national health systems. So what should be done? We must ensure that the limited scope that does exist, in terms of both competence and resources, is harnessed to achieve maximum results in terms of cooperation, information exchanges, identification of best practice, and health education – as has already been done under the various specific programmes and the 1993 framework programme. The Commission's presentation of this communication is most timely: in a sense, it establishes a transition between the final phase of that programme and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, when there will be a new framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Needle's excellent report makes a series of timely and practical proposals. There could be others too, and I believe that this debate should continue outside this House: health researchers and operators should provide the Commission with information and proposals as to how maximum benefit can be drawn from the meagre powers and resources available. How, for example, can we act rapidly in response to an unforseen disaster such as BSE, or cope with inevitabilities like population ageing, dwindling public funds and rising health costs. Yesterday this House discussed a document on women's health; in both that report and this one, we call for separate statistics on and specific programmes for women. Finally, for the sake of Europe's women and men, we call for a Community presence in the health arena which offers real protection.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Poggiolini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication on the development of public health in the European Community will probably be the last major health policy issue on which Parliament expresses an opinion before the end of this parliamentary term. Mr Needle has produced an excellent and most welcome report, and has made considerable efforts to amend the Commission's text.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication takes stock of what has been done over the past five years, but above all it outlines a new global public health strategy for Europe in the twenty‐first century, which will very soon be followed by specific measures, once the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force. I would recall that the eight existing health programmes – 'Europe against cancer', AIDS, drug addiction, health monitoring, the epidemiological surveillance network on communicable diseases, and so on – will lapse in or around the year 2000. The EU"s citizens, who enjoy the advantages of a single market and are about to acquire a single currency, also have a right to a high level of health protection, as stipulated in the new Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty. But if this objective is to be attained in practice, public health must stop being the Cinderella of Community policies: it must be funded much more generously than to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity, the Union can do a good deal to improve information in this area, to react rapidly to health threats and, above all, to confront the main causes of diseases through prevention. We therefore welcome the rapporteur's suggestion of a single operational unit and enhanced administrative structures within the Commission, in order to equip DG V‐F with sufficient staff and resources to manage effectively all aspects of health policy. It is crucial, however, that the Commission should present as soon as possible detailed, concrete proposals for the next five years, taking Parliament's wishes into account. We very much regret that not all the recommendations contained in the 1993 resolution on health policy after Maastricht were acted on, and that inadequate follow‐up was given to three important resolutions adopted almost unanimously by this House in 1996, concerning the European health passport, blood self‐sufficiency in the Community and, especially, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the period 2000‐2010 has been declared the European Decade for Health. It is our duty to fulfil the expectations of 375 million people who aspire to live in peace and prosperity, but above all in good health.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Eisma </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, my compliments to Mr Needle on this excellent report, in which he rightly notes that the Amsterdam Treaty offers new opportunities for greater weight to be given to public health in the European Union. The current policy is ripe for review and the financial resources are regrettably very limited. The Commission, and I am looking to Mr Bangemann here, must do something about that. I am keen to see what initiatives the Commission will take to meet the growing need for public health policy in the early years of the next century.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on the 1999 budget for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I advocated increasing public health spending to EUR 50 million. By way of comparison, that is just 5 % of the total budget for premiums to tobacco growers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious to me that an effective public health policy in Europe is not just a matter of more money. What we have to do is integrate public health aspects more effectively into other areas of policy. Take agriculture and transport, two areas where there is much to be gained. I do not need to spell it out: BSE, the countless deaths on our roads and the pollution caused by the transport industry have everything to do with public health policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point on enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe. The public health problems there are huge. It will take a great deal to bring their standards of public health up to our own. And their standards have great implications for ours. So I hope the Commission will put a good deal of energy into solving the public health problems of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Funding comes first and foremost, and Agenda 2000 is currently under discussion. We do not yet know how European Union funds will be distributed between 2000 and 2006; it remains to be seen how much will eventually be available for the health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, cooperation with Member States and with international organisations involved in health protection must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to integrate our health policy with all other European policies. The memory of the consequences of a misguided agricultural economic policy, namely the BSE problem, must surely be fresh in all our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the need for prevention must be emphasised. We must remember that although responsibility for the provision of health care rests with the Member States, the European Union and the Member States can cooperate on issues concerning prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is in a position to promote and develop cooperation and information networks at all levels. Previous health programmes experienced problems relating to transparency, inadequate assessment and insufficient funding. Mr Needle proposes eliminating the shortcomings of previous programmes during what ought to be the decade for health, between 2000 and 2010.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cabrol </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission communication on the development of public health policy in the European Community expresses the Union"s concern to increase the competence which it has acquired in this area due to the Maastricht Treaty being ratified and which has been confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to this public health policy, it is proving somewhat difficult to gain the acceptance of certain principles to which all the Member States should adhere. For example, I could mention the European epidemiological monitoring centre which is particularly needed and which my various reports on health have called for over the last four years. However, this has encountered resistance from both the Commission and the Council. Yet, as indicated by the Commission, this centre would allow us to react rapidly to threats to health.</p>
<p class="contents">The other two principles proposed by the Commission for a future health policy are an improvement in information on public health and effective actions for health promotion and disease prevention. These principles and the issues which they raise are genuine problems which the Union must solve in the future. Their main priorities will be nutrition, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, Alzheimer"s disease and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I must forewarn you about the new scares which might arise due to the progress needed in order to allow this health policy. These scares might lead to this progress being blocked as a result of the misuse of the sacrosanct precautionary principle. It is true that all progress involves risk. This is where we must apply the cost/benefit principle by weighing the advantages against the disadvantages.

Not only projects, programmes and research can now be pursued in this area but so can directives, and – thanks to the inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty of the precautionary principle – prevention has become the cornerstone of European health policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not however mean in practice that these statements of principle are applied unreservedly. Colleagues have already referred to the lack of action over the European health passport, the fact that health funding remains utterly inadequate, and that even after the BSE scare, insufficient attention is being paid to the linkage between health and food. In general terms, it can be said that the public is still not being properly informed about health issues, assuming that public health should not be subject to the interests of economic lobbies. Regrettably, the opposite was likewise demonstrated in the previous debate on electromagnetic fields.</p>

Firstly, we need to take into account all the inhabitants of this continent, both the sick and the healthy. The sick must be listened to individually by doctors, which is precisely the latter"s role, but they must also be listened to collectively by politicians, particularly through associations for the sick. It is AIDS which has taught us these lessons in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">By bringing these people together we can promote a dialogue between the public authorities, as the responsible authority, the experts, led naturally by the WHO, the medical profession, which must not be forgotten, the NGOs, industry and the trade unions. Everyone must have two objectives: firstly, to identify priorities and concentrate resources to combat epidemics which will be accurately identified, and secondly, to fight against inequalities among the people of this continent with regard to the protection of their health.</p>

The Needle report on the European Union"s new public health policy seems to ignore this fact completely. The Commission notes it, but talks of a large number of ‘premature deaths" in Europe. What, I ask myself, is premature? In the Commission proposal, the age of 68 is the critical threshold. But we are forgetting that elsewhere in the world, life expectancy is far shorter. We also have to accept that we are mortal and that European citizens, with or without a European policy on public health, cannot be absolutely sure of surviving past 68.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also make the point that Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty clearly aims merely to complement the public health policies of the Member States. Only if there is a clear benefit for Europe as a whole can we make budget funds available, for example to fund the exchange of knowledge of new medicines and therapies and the development of orphan medicinal products. I would therefore like to see a limited budget, and I regard a separate directorate‐general for public health as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to spend more on public health, let us show solidarity and support the public health policies of the Central and Eastern European countries, rather than giving greater priority to health‐related obligations, as the rapporteur would like to do.</p>

Emissions into the atmosphere are catastrophic to health. Up to 24 000 people in my country die prematurely each year due to this major hazard. Already in Northern Ireland, a product – Soltron – is in use which has had immediate results in combating poisons emitted. If we are to make progress as fast as possible in our efforts to improve Community health, we should be creating an incentive for the use of this product in order that a major health gain can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">We must harness the field of science to deliver rapid and affordable solutions today. In Northern Ireland it has been discovered by the largest transport operation called Translink that 60 % of black smoke and 40 % of carbon monoxide has been wiped out by using this product. This technology is available now. It is our duty in the quest for improved public health to put it to use.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that both my colleagues and myself who met with Commission officials many months ago have not heard from them or seen any action taken.</p>

The Treaty makes people"s health a more binding policy aim than previously, not only at Community but also at national level, and it is important to focus attention on how we can acquire that Community added value, so that it is visible at both Community level and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to repeat the praise that has already been heaped on Mr Needle"s excellent report. I would like to go a little further and make a few remarks on the fact that public health must be seen from a very broad perspective. Of course it is already very broadly based at the present, but it must be said that employment is an important basis too for public health. We have discovered from various sets of statistics that unemployment is one reason for deteriorating public health; exclusion in particular, stemming from long‐term unemployment, for example, is a clear risk to health. We obviously have to act against this, taking advantage of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in which employment was placed at the centre of Community policy. Public services, universally available health services and effective social networks are the factors which ensure we have a standard of public health that is as high as possible. Furthermore, consumer and environmental policies are extremely important, as is the fact that public health should play a clearer role in the enlargement strategy.</p>

Of course many wishes and desires were voiced about all the things Europe could do. Naturally I agree with Mr Needle that we must devote a great deal of attention to health, but unlike many previous speakers I do not believe that this can all be done in Europe</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Member States have a very major responsibility. There is a short phrase in one paragraph to the effect that a future revision of the Treaty should provide for greater involvement of the Community in matters relating to health protection. In my view only the Member States can take on this responsibility. If we keep giving the Community more responsibility, I do not believe, given the relatively restricted apparatus of the Commission, that it will be in a position to accomplish everything the Member States have so far been able to do with their much more extensive administrative resources. So I would like to draw attention to a few points I am not happy with.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to see the EU implement those matters that are referred to in the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty but I would not like it to go beyond that or to call on the Commission to do so either. I also think we are not in a position to create equality in health. There are very different ideas and considerations on, for instance, cures and treatments. I am glad we have these widely different approaches and also that we have freedom of movement. After all, the Court of Justice has ruled that people can be treated differently in different countries. I want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in Europe. I would far rather see the responsibility left with the Member States. I also believe that the regional authorities are not all in a position to establish contacts with the Commission. I would like to see pilot projects. Information can be provided but information campaigns are another difficult matter, as we cannot conduct an information campaign that is the same for all Member States because health policy also has to be conveyed in a psychologically very different manner. That is why I take a different view on these points and would be glad if these points, with which I am not happy, were dropped as a result of the vote. Only then could I approve the report.</p>

<p class="contents">However, this debate on health takes me back to the vote at midday today on the Hautala report on women"s health and I am astonished that nobody has referred to this. The vote on paragraph 11 restricting the legalisation of abortion marks a real backward step when compared with many national laws. I would never have imagined myself participating in such a setback for women, particularly after yesterday. This challenging of the right to the termination of pregnancies is the result of one of those awful compromises which the PSE and the PPE so often make. It is indicative of political cowardliness, capitulation and the renunciation of all the struggles which have helped to increase women"s rights over their own bodies. It just shows contempt for the battles which have in their time led to vital alliances in the political struggle of certain women, in particular Simone Veil, in defiance of the insults which she received from her own side.</p>
<p class="contents">This attitude shows irresponsibility and political poverty. You can count on me and the 54 Members who voted for our amendment to continue the struggle in an atmosphere of heightened solidarity with the most reactionary women in our countries on this subject.</p>

This has given us greater responsibilities, because we must now issue directives and interpret responsibly a role which until recently was a mere aspiration. First of all, therefore, we must change our attitude and attempt to address Europe's public health problems. That is what Mr Needle's report seeks to do, and consequently we are happy to approve it.</p>
<p class="contents">One fundamental aspect here is to recognise Parliament's role in determining and controlling the health budget. This is a vital point, in that resources are the overriding problem in our attempt to achieve common standards and respond to public health requirements. Then there are the problems of improving information and reacting to health threats. In my opinion, it is no longer enough to confine ourselves to certain initiatives, as we did in the past; nutrition, obesity, cardiovascular disease – and not only cancer, AIDS and so on – now need to be addressed in a harmonised, coherent fashion in all the EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Professor Cabrol's suggestion of a European Health Observatory, which is also taken up in Mr Needle's report, is well worth considering. Mention is made in particular of a Directorate‐General for Health located in Brussels: that would undoubtedly be a fresh approach to dealing with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are other problems, including enlargement to the east, where scientific trends and responses to health requirements undoubtedly lag behind those in Western European countries. It is important to tackle this problem, because harmonisation is crucial and cannot be achieved in circumstances of inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would merely say in conclusion that, since we are approaching the European Decade for Health – from 2000 to 2010 – I hope that the Needle report, which we support, will generate renewed and reinforced interest in public health.</p>

Mr Needle's excellent report also makes this plain. Nevertheless, there are obvious areas where collaboration at European level creates added value. Cooperation between the Member States might be advisable in certain circumstances, thereby avoiding duplication of work, for example in analysing the health risks posed by chemical substances or in disseminating information more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The report mentions best practice and standards in health care. In my view, this is the area where the Commission has an important role to play. In the business sector, best practice – known as ‘benchmarking" – is an excellent way for businesses to maximise their performance. Similarly, it would be worthwhile for the EU countries to pool their experiences with such things as how policy‐driven systems operate compared with patient‐driven ones, how private and state‐funded health care compete with one another, and the effects of competition between the different systems on medical care. I am sure that most of this information is available today, but it should be compiled and made available to the Member States. The proper use of this information could lead to improved medical care at a lower cost. I am convinced that my own country, Sweden, would also find the exercise very valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also mentions agricultural policy and the BSE crisis. However, I think that support for tobacco growers is a matter of serious concern. Smoking already claims hundreds of thousands of victims every day. So it seems unreasonable to support tobacco cultivation to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year. The support should be phased out and transferred from agriculture to the regional policy budget. This would make it easier to reach a decision on providing support for alternative sources of employment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, standing in for my colleague who is in fact the Commissioner responsible and who regrets not being able to be present at the debate, let me thank Mr Needle for his very good report.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become clear from the discussion where we must start with our work. If there is still confusion even in this House about what the priority should be in European health activities, then of course we must first be clear in our own minds what we can do to combat existing weaknesses in the EU health system. In my view, there is a great deal we can do.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is not a question of setting up a new administration, that is to say to add a new, European health administration to the various administrations that already exist at national and also regional level. Here I can reassure Mrs Schleicher that that is not our intention. But I must say that in our view the idea put forward by some Members that we need simply to increase the funds and then spend the resources accordingly, and then we would manage to tackle the problem properly, is not the right method either.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of health we cannot hope to create a greater effect simply by allocating more resources; instead we must realise that this system is no longer working in the way it really should. It is not efficient enough. That is why the Commission considers it very important that we begin by collecting and collating the information in order, as Mr Virgin just said, to establish a kind of benchmarking for the various systems, so as to identify where there are better options that can perhaps be recommended to others.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the collection of information on, for example, the use of medicinal products, would do a great deal towards reducing costs and making treatment more efficient, because at present the experience gained in particular clinics or by practising doctors is simply not being collected or made available on a Europe‐wide basis. That is in itself a disadvantage for research, but it is an even greater disadvantage in practice, because patients could be cared for much better if general findings were available that could then be tailored to the individual patient. So there is a great deal to do here. Of course the Member States can also do it on their own behalf, but collating the findings would indeed produce a European added value. In any case, there is no need to discuss that further. The Treaty of Amsterdam has now passed that task on to the European Union and Mrs Schleicher does indeed appreciate that competition between systems, for instance the freedom to offer medical services in the single market, can be useful; I also find the European Court of Justice rulings in this area very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else we should not overlook, and where we also have experience, especially from the USA which puts far more emphasis on the involvement of the patient in question or the potential patient; this means the patient is involved in the shaping of the health system. Where that happens, for example where drugs are freely obtainable, namely what are known as OTC or over the counter products, we find a markedly higher health awareness on the part of the individual. That means that the more you involve the public in the decision making and the more they themselves are asked to make the decisions, the surer you can be that they will become more health conscious. For that is certainly one of the problems. I have been looking at the judgments pronounced in America against the cigarette industry, as you probably all have too. It is not fitting for us to criticise this on legal grounds, but if someone comes along and institutes proceedings claiming that he was not adequately informed about the risks of smoking, then we can only wonder whether than person has been living in our society at all. The risks have constantly been indicated for the past twenty years, not just on the packets but all around us, and here we should not do something that would be very dangerous, namely release individuals from their responsibility for their own, highly personal health and in a sense look after them, care for them and prescribe to them exactly what they must do, from the cradle to the grave. That would certainly shorten rather than extend their lifespan.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we want to achieve is the active involvement of the public, and especially of those who are sick, of the patients. I therefore very much agree with what Mr Pradier said, namely that we should cooperate even more closely than before with patients" associations, whether they centre on a particular disease or simply represent particular patients" interests. That is in fact the point of departure we have chosen here and I am very glad all this has been properly understood. Of course I will report back to my colleague, who is responsible for this area, and also tell him what you said about setting up a new directorate‐general. If Parliament in its wisdom follows this up and grants us the corresponding posts, we will be able to do all these things. Similarly we agree with Mr Virgin"s comment that it makes no sense whatsoever to spend money on preventive health care, especially on information about the risks of smoking, while at the same time subsidising tobacco crops. Here we agree with his assessment of the situation. Unfortunately, at its last vote on the subject Parliament approved these subsidies by a majority. Since, thank God, we live in a democracy, this time it is for Parliament to cry <span class="italic">mea culpa</span> .</p>
