<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by taking the opportunity to congratulate the international community and all of us on the fact that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into force last Monday. This event must be regarded as one of the most epoch-making in international legal development since the Second World War.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty-nine countries have ratified the statute of the court, and we can see that it now already has significant support in the international community. A statute of this kind is something which the European Parliament has called for again and again, as I myself did a couple of years ago in a report on human rights, adopted by a very large majority. Parliamentarians have spoken and written about it. Now it is here, and that is a fact I think we should celebrate here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The many international and internal conflicts which the world witnessed in the twentieth Century underline the need for this court to be set up quickly. The International Criminal Court can help make the world safer, more just and more peaceful. By its mere existence, it could deter people from committing the serious crimes – war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity – which we have unfortunately also witnessed in our own lifetimes and until quite recently. It is important that such crimes should not go unpunished and that it should be possible to hold everyone responsible for their actions. That is why this International Criminal Court is a central plank in the strengthening of the international legal community.</p>
<p class="contents">We must appeal to all states to sign up to the Rome Statute. Universal endorsement is necessary if the court is seriously to be able to operate effectively. With a view to obtaining such universal support, we adopted a common position last year, which has recently been updated. On the basis of this common position, the European Union has employed political dialogue and initiatives in an attempt to obtain the broadest possible endorsement of the court from countries all around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court is a recurrent theme in our contact with the United States, and it is precisely our talks with the United States that are the subject of our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States share the same basic values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the principles of a state based on the Rule of Law. That is why we have always seen it as quite natural and necessary for the United States to be among those who have signed up to the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We have no doubt that the United States could make a particularly positive contribution to the court. During the diplomatic conference in Rome in 1998, we were perfectly clear about the United States’ reservations concerning certain provisions of the statute. Moreover, we did our best to find ways of dispelling or accommodating these reservations, but unfortunately to no avail. To our regret, we have to note that, on 6 May of this year, the United States informed the UN Secretary-General that it did not intend to endorse the statute, which had in actual fact been signed under the previous US administration. We believe that the United States has taken a wrong decision, and the European Union deeply regrets the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, or more specifically on 17 June, the General Affairs Council adopted conclusions expressing our concern regarding the present American bill which goes under the title of the American Service Members Protection Act, or ASPA as it is called. The latest version proposes limitations upon the United States’s participation in UN peacekeeping operations, prohibits the transfer of information to the International Criminal Court and bans American military aid to most of the participants in the court. As we said in our conclusions from the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, we believe that the ASPA could seriously undermine the work of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">We also emphasised our misgivings about the provision authorising the American President to use every available means to free people detained at the request of the court, including people detained in the EU Member States. This provision has especially given rise to concern in the Netherlands, which is to be the seat of the court and which has made no bones about dubbing the ASPA ‘The Hague Invasion Act’.</p>
<p class="contents">If the ASPA is adopted, it will be a very unfortunate development for the international community. We have expressed our concern to the American administration at all levels. Our top representatives in Washington have concerned themselves with the problem over a long period. It is a grave matter, a substantial hiccup and a serious problem in relations between Europe and the United States. I should like, however, to say that, even though it is a major problem and a difficult situation, we shall not, in my view, achieve anything by describing the American bill as a threat to transatlantic relations. It would be unreasonable to raise it to that level, and I should like to make that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the International Criminal Court is a matter of global concern and not a bilateral problem between the United States and the EU. It is crucial that we not be confrontational, for that would get us nowhere. There are also, unfortunately, other major partners of the EU, such as China and India, which oppose the court. Turkey, as an associated country, has still not signed the statute or otherwise endorsed our common position or any of the EU’s declarations in support of the court. In Japan and Russia, there is political will to endorse the statute, but this has still not been embodied in the form of decisions. Nonetheless, the fact that all these countries are still not participants in the court has neither damaged, nor caused a cooling-off in, bilateral relations. We have been very careful to avoid confrontation on this issue but, at the same time, sought to keep the court high on the agendas of our regular meetings for exchanging views. Through persistent lobbying in support of the statute, we have already managed to convince a number of countries, and we hope that, by this means, we can convince still more.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to state that the International Criminal Court is not the only area on which the United States and the EU disagree. Friends are entitled to disagree, but I think we are wise always to insist that what unites the EU and the United States is, in spite of everything, stronger than what divides us. We can all point to examples: steel (on the subject of which we shall soon hopefully obtain a solution), bananas (an area in which a solution was found and about which there is a lot to say) and the Kyoto Protocol (in connection with which we are continuing our high-level dialogue). Sometimes we find a solution, and sometimes we continue to disagree. In the human rights area, we have different attitudes to the death penalty. Through our long-term efforts in combating the death penalty, we have, however, succeeded in influencing American opinion. As an example, I would mention the recent American Supreme Court judgment on the Atkins case, ruling out the death penalty for mentally retarded people. The EU had a part to play in this matter through what is termed an ‘<span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> brief’ of which the US Supreme Court took account in its reflections on the issue. That is a policy we wish to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The American administration has assured us that an American intervention in the territory of an EU country would be – and I quote – ‘inconceivable’. That has been said by both Secretary of State Colin Powell and Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman. Many American soldiers gave their lives for freedom and democracy in Europe. I cannot imagine their grandchildren taking it into their heads to invade one of our Member States. The ASPA proposal is now on the table, however, and section 3008 concerning the use of force will constitute a dangerous precedent in international law. I can assure you that we shall monitor this matter very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court will soon be able to prove its worth as an independent and effective international court. We in the EU will spare no effort to ensure its success. I am sure that those who are at present opponents of the International Criminal Court will be able to see for themselves that the Rome Statute both ensures the highest standards of law and order and guards against the use of the court for political purposes. We probably have to face the fact that universal endorsement of the court is still somewhere in the future. I have confidence, however, that our arguments will eventually win the day, as they have in the many other areas I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">By using its veto in the UN Security Council last Monday, the United States took a very far-reaching and unfortunate step in its opposition to the court. I understand, however, that negotiations to find a compromise solution in the UN Security Council will be resumed later today. It is essential that a solution be found which does not undermine the EU’s common position and the statute of the court and which, at the same time, leaves the United States still committed to its peacekeeping operations. As holders of the Presidency, we shall do everything to ensure that this is what happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, two days ago the International Criminal Court entered into force. This is very much welcomed. Bringing to justice those individuals who commit the most serious crimes against humanity, including genocide, widespread murder of civilians, torture and mass rape, is one of the major objectives of the EU's human rights policy. The creation of an International Criminal Court is central to this fight. By investigating and bringing to justice such individuals, the Court provides an essential means of promoting respect for international humanitarian law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union stands firm in its commitment to the ICC. Now that the Rome Statute has entered into force, the ICC is finally a reality. However, the hardest work still lies ahead of us. We need to give the ICC real teeth so that it stands as a genuine disincentive to those who imagine they can get away with committing the most heinous crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the withdrawal by the United States of its signature from the Rome Statute came as a blow to the international community as it strives to prevent a repeat of the atrocities which have plagued recent conflicts. The fact that the world's greatest military power is not with us is a blow – there is no denying this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time in recent history that Europe has taken the lead and set the international agenda. Many wrote off the Kyoto Protocol after the withdrawal of the United States, but the EU pressed on and ratified Kyoto, setting an example which was followed by the global community to deliver a genuine prospect for tackling the problem of climate change. We intend to do the same to make the ICC a working institution for global justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As an independent nation, the United States has a sovereign right not to participate in the ICC if that is its wish. In telling the world on 6 May that it did not intend to ratify the Rome Statute, the United States also gave assurances that it would not actively seek to undermine the work of the International Criminal Court, nor dissuade others from ratifying the Rome Statute. Therefore the decision by the US Senate on 6 June to adopt its own version of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), previously adopted by the US House of Representatives, came as a great surprise and disappointment to many of America's allies and partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hopeful that modifications can still be made to the text in the House and Senate Conference that would help dilute the impact of this legislation. The ASPA's provisions, as currently drafted, are a grave cause for concern to supporters of the ICC for several reasons. By attempting to prohibit military assistance to nations which ratify the ICC, the ASPA could dissuade countries from participating in it. By seeking to remove US personnel operating under UN mandate from the jurisdiction of the ICC, the ASPA might restrict US participation in peace-keeping operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already seeing the dramatic effect that this could have on the work of the UN to maintain peace and stability in hot spots across the globe. The US move to oppose the renewal of the UN's mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina threatens to undo years of work by the international community to rebuild that fractured community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's first analysis identifies several potentially negative effects on the political environment and Rule of Law in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Not least of these is the counter-terrorism work being carried out by the international police task force within Bosnian territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is working around the clock with the UN and other partners, including the United States, to find a solution to this crisis. But on one thing we stand firm. We will not allow the ICC to be handicapped from birth by excluding the work of the United Nations from its jurisdiction. There must be equality under the law regardless of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">There are further grounds for concern at the possible impact of the ASPA. By prohibiting cooperation between its own judicial and law enforcement authorities and the ICC, the ASPA could set back the cause of the international fight against terror.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, there is a particularly disturbing provision authorising the President to use any means necessary to bring about the release of US personnel being detained at the request of the ICC, including on the territory of EU Member States. In the light of these considerations, the European Union could not and did not remain silent. The EU reaction was discussed at the General Affairs Council of 17 June, where we adopted conclusions expressing our concerns at the ASPA's provisions. We also agreed upon a strategy for presenting our concerns to the United States in a coordinated fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 June the Spanish ambassador to the United States, together with the Commission's head of delegation in Washington, presented an agreed statement on behalf of the EU Member States to the US Department of State. At the same time, EU ambassadors wrote to senior figures in the US Administration, as well as to senior congressmen, conveying their grave concern at the contents of the ASPA. On 20 June US ambassadors in EU capitals, as well as the US ambassador to the EU, were summoned to be informed of the EU's position.</p>
<p class="contents">We sincerely hope that this series of interventions will persuade the US Administration to withhold its support from this piece of legislation and prevent it from becoming US law. I trust that the Council and the Commission can rely on the full support of the European Parliament in carrying through this strategy. I would therefore like to encourage you, as legislators, to take up this issue with your counterparts in the US Congress, whether through the legislators' dialogue, or any other contacts you may have with the Hill.</p>
<p class="contents">As the democratically elected representatives of the people of Europe, you are best placed to carry this message to the US Congress. I am looking forward to seeing Parliament make its views known this afternoon in no uncertain way as you debate and adopt a resolution on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without delay, the European Union, in order that this terrorism might be combated, made it possible to extradite people to the US. We did this because we share the same values and standards. After all, the United States, like us, is a democratic constitutional state whom it should be possible to trust.</p>
<p class="contents">This same position on shared values leads us to support the International Criminal Court. We are excited about the establishment of this Court. We assumed that only rogue states that are not prepared to try their own citizens for crimes against humanity, genocide and other large-scale offences, would be frightened of this Court. We are therefore shocked by the United States’s reaction. We really did not expect this, because it is abundantly clear that the Criminal Court targets states and citizens of a different kind.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, in fact, that the United States places itself above the standards which we thought we had in common with them. Today, we read in the US newspapers that we simply have to accept that America is like an 800 lb gorilla that refuses to be restricted in its freedom of movement. In our view, descriptions of this kind about oneself are extremely unhelpful. Such an attitude also threatens the alliance – and I fully endorse what Mr Haarder said on this subject – because the moral content of the alliance is in this way denied. This attitude is also evident in the common fight against serious distortions of international Rule of Law, which must be frustrated. The US President intends to cancel cooperation in joint action in Bosnia, East Timor, Kosovo, and suchlike. There is even talk of a veto of the UN mandate for actions of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Faithful, historical allies, such as the Netherlands, perhaps the United States’ oldest ally, are implicitly threatened with violent action. This 'Hague invasion act' must be the maddest thing ever. It is actually better to joke about this in order to illustrate that this is an impetuous step and that the Americans, with their sense of humour, will have to retract measures which are actually wholly inappropriate for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's resolution urges the American administration to retrace its steps and make use of the options open to the ICC participants in order to be able to try their own staff in their own way. For the European Union, this remarkable incident should serve as a warning. We should in any event develop political and defence capacity which enables us to take up our responsibility for international security without American participation. Moreover, I am happy to follow the line taken by Mr Haarder and Commissioner Byrne in respect of future policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, it is true that nothing is to be gained from regrets, but neither is anything to be gained from avoiding consideration of problems and concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news is that 76 States have ratified the Statute, but the bad news is this intolerable and intolerant attitude of the United States to the international system of justice which is aimed at putting an end to impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush has waged a campaign of harassment against the Court and against the countries which have signed or ratified its statute, which is completely unacceptable. Only arrogance, ignorance and pride – the three things together – can explain a reaction like the one which has led the two Houses to approve the law we are talking about. It is outrageous. At least they have said that they will not invade the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union, Parliament and all the European institutions must state as firmly as possible that we will not tolerate such arbitrary behaviour; not the invasion, but the arbitrary nature of the law itself. We must demand that the members of the United Nations Security Council defend the integrity of the new Court and we must prevent the United States from using its capacity for manoeuvre in the Security Council to undermine a text which they never liked, incorporating blanket protection for United States troops and civilian staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The Statute of Rome is based on the principle of complementarity and offers every safeguard against the inappropriate use of the Court. I am sure that when it comes into operation some people will be reassured. We must urge the sensible members – as Commissioner Byrne called them – of the United States Congress and Senate to prevent the said law from entering into force. If they are not going to ratify the Statute, at least they should refrain from adopting measures to disturb or hinder its operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Benjamin B. Ferencz, said that there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without courts to decide what is fair and legitimate in any particular circumstance. Millions of citizens the world over believe that this International Criminal Court responds to that aspiration.

We join our American friends in a celebration of America's achievements. In two world wars the Americans came to liberate us from darkness and violence, and when the Balkans erupted the Americans stepped in when Europe failed. The Americans are there when you need them, ready to fight and die for a world of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, freedom and democracy do not stop after the obtaining of peace. In order to maintain peace and prevent wars perpetrators of crimes must <span class="italic">always</span> be brought to justice. That is why we in Europe find it utterly incomprehensible that Americans are now cheering on their legislators as they are killing off an essential tool that was missing in our quest to make the world a safer and more just place – the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has a mandate to prosecute only the most horrible crimes – genocide, mass murder and mass rape. In the past we have had to set up ad hoc tribunals for the Milosevics of this world. Now 74 countries have ratified a court which Kofi Annan rightly calls "a great victory for justice, and for world order – a turn away from the rule of brute force, and towards the Rule of Law."</p>
<p class="contents">America and Europe have built-in safeguards to ensure the Court will not become a political tool. Any government can prevent the Court from taking action against its citizens by prosecuting them at home. Despite all this, the US has withdrawn its signature. If that were not a large enough blow to international justice, Congress then accepted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, which not only threatens to withhold military and financial support to any country that cooperates with the Court, but also allows the US to invade a long-time friend and ally – my country to be precise. The Dutch people cannot understand how our American friends can now threaten us with violence, and for what? Is it really more important to allow American soldiers to commit war crimes than to build a safer world? Is it necessary to jeopardise international peacekeeping missions just to make the point that superpowers do not have to play by the rules?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps this is an opportunity for Europe. Europe has a chance to show the world that it is indeed a union of values; that we believe in a world in which we are all equal before the law, a world in which perpetrators of crimes will be brought to justice, no matter who they are and where they are hiding: a world ruled by law, not by the sword of the mightiest.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot believe that Americans do not also want this type of world and I hope deeply that they will reconsider their position. However, until they do, Europe must take the lead. We must show the world that we will stick to our principles and fight for justice. If a majority of the House sends that signal to the world tomorrow by supporting our compromise resolution then we are also celebrating Independence Day, the day that Europe stood up for its values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me make it clear that I am very gratified by the role played by the European Union in bringing the Statute to fruition and enabling the International Criminal Court to begin work. However, if this is to continue, this approach must be rigorously upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I think you have trivialised the problems in some respects, especially by painting an overly positive picture of transatlantic relations and Europe's ability to assert its position vis-à-vis the USA. This may well be true of the bananas issue, but if we look at the complexity of the trend over recent months – the attacks on the Chemical Weapons Convention, the obstructing of a monitoring organisation for biological weapons, the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the threat of withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty and of renunciation of the Test Ban Treaty, the threat to the non-proliferation regime, the failure to support the Landmine Convention, and Kyoto, to name just a few – it is apparent that there are major problems and that issues of principle are at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the International Criminal Court is an even more fundamental issue in some respects. Mrs van der Laan has just said that American troops fought for freedom in Europe in the First and Second World Wars. I do not want to generalise here – for there are other examples in American history – but I do not entirely agree with her view. What is at stake here is a fundamental principle which is also enshrined in American history, namely the principle of common values, which has been underlined here and is now being called into question. Jean-Jacques Rousseau described the role of the law as follows: "In the relationship between the weak and the strong, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that liberates." A law which does not apply to the strong is extremely problematical. I therefore fully endorse the draft resolution on behalf of my group and would ask the Members of this House to vote for our amendment as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, this controversy has developed into an extremely serious conflict between Europe and the United States. </p>
<p class="contents">I would immediately like to make it clear what irritates and vexes me the most, and I think I speak for many other Europeans. As an American professor expressed it in this morning's Herald Tribune, a newspaper which is also read by Mr Oostlander, the United States behaves like a big gorilla that does not tolerate any restrictions imposed on its behaviour. In fact, what it comes down to is that the United States thinks it is above comparison with other nations. Strict agreements? Discipline? This is all well and good for other countries, but the United States does not feel like adhering to these. </p>
<p class="contents">It is the double standards that go against the grain with Europe. If the Americans can do as they please, how can we in heaven’s name prevent the Russians and the Chinese, that do not happen to support the International Criminal Court either, from doing as they please and riding roughshod over agreements reached at international level? Meanwhile, the questions are mounting. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, allow me to submit to you the most pressing questions. It looks as if the future of SFOR is not at risk because a new UN mandate is not required for this. Is this also how the German Government views this? Is there therefore no risk of German troops withdrawing from Bosnia? And what is this saying about the legal position of the SFOR military? Are they immune from prosecution by the International Criminal Court? Does this immunity apply in Bosnia, or does it apply elsewhere in the world too? </p>
<p class="contents">If the mandate of the UN police force in Bosnia is not extended, which is not likely, how will the non-European countries, which account for approximately 900 agents, or 60% of the total, react? If these leave soon, does this mean that the European soldiers and European police officers who stay behind will be tested to the limit? Is the European Union – and I sincerely hope so – as Mr Xavier Solana stated yesterday, willing and able to provide additional police troops promptly for this police force, and is Mr Haarder, is the Council, prepared to pay extra for this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Council one last specific question about the position of Great Britain and France in the Security Council. Is this now truly being coordinated with the European Union across the board? In other words, am I to conclude, if the answer is positive, that the Council too endorses the compromise proposals which are now, for example, being tabled by Britain and which, in my view, undermine the position of the Criminal Court? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to finish on a positive note. It could be a step in the right direction if the European Union turned this into a policy of defending people, in the knowledge that accountability is required, for one King Kong is more than enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The US Government remains intransigent; in these circumstances, to disarm our Member States means disarming Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The most astonishing thing about this whole business is that we constantly prove blind to the ways of this so-called partner. The fact is that the United States is not a partner in any area of activity. Its unilateralism prevails both in its foreign policy and in its anti-environmentalist stance – on the subject of climate change, for example – not to mention, of course, its strong-arm tactics in the main areas of trade policy. The Americans are encouraging European countries to disarm but are themselves engaged in a vast programme of unilateral rearmament. They want to extend NATO as far eastward as possible without changing its command structures. They advocate universal interference in the government of nations and refuse to listen to any opinion as soon as it challenges their own views. Only the imperialist mind thinks in this way. In actual fact, Europeans would have to be very weak or even – dare I say it – cowardly to overlook this evidence. The United States does not want partners. It will only accept acolytes. It is, quite simply, an empire.</p>
<p class="contents">By extolling a ludicrous system that seeks to subject all human activities across the globe to the law of profitability alone, in other words the law of the jungle, where might is right, this master of the world has been responsible for much of the poverty on our planet. From that point of view, Europe has but one political option, namely to pursue a policy of redressing the balance, because otherwise we shall truly become America’s poodle. To pursue such a policy is the courageous, the honourable course, which we owe not only to the nations of Europe but to Europe itself and, ultimately, to that venerable ideal of a free world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I always thought that, especially as it marks a momentous change, it would surely encounter all kinds of resistance: not just the more open and even more transparent although unacceptable resistance of our US friends, but also that of others. I hope we shall not forget the hostility and deliberately obstructive behaviour of other great powers beset with internal problems and even crime – I am deliberately referring to our Chinese friends and others – who are also putting obstacles in the way of the International Criminal Court without, however, having the courage to face an open debate in a dignified manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to debate and discuss the matter with our allies in an atmosphere of mutual respect, without trying to claim any sort of legal high ground, but resolutely putting across our point of view. With all due respect to the US Administration, I should like to remind it that the International Criminal Court is a tool that is intended to be permanent, whereas political leaders are, by definition, bound to change. It may also be our duty to do our utmost to make this tool effective, in the conviction that future administrations of our US friends may possibly take a different attitude and themselves take advantage of the major tool we are offering them. As the Council has quite rightly pointed out, something similar is happening with the death penalty issue, where dialogue has led the Federal Court to take major steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am not really interested in discussing whether we are facing an irreversible split in what we call the West. I am interested, rather, in understanding how we move on from here. In this respect, I believe two major responses are emerging. First of all, it is worth noting the growing number of countries choosing to ratify the court. By 11 April, 66 countries had ratified it and, in little more than two months, the number has now risen to 76. Secondly, we must realise that everything depends on us. What we have to do today is to work out whether we Europeans are willing and able to take on the responsibility, and hence also the costs in terms of money and personnel, and move forwards, for instance as regards peace missions. Indeed, I am afraid that the real aim of our US friends is not so much to scupper the International Criminal Court as to get out of the peace-keeping operations and thus in some way attack the United Nations system.</p>
<p class="contents">I know our ambassadors in New York are negotiating tirelessly and resolutely but not inflexibly. I believe the greatest contribution we can and must make is to stand by our convictions and be prepared to take on the costs and the responsibility. The more pro-European we are, the more I believe we will manage to provide valid tools, not to demonise, of course, but to foster dialogue and save the alliance with the United States, which I consider strategic and vital for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And they will perhaps criticise Israel. These are countries that have voiced objections to the Rome Statute, or have refused to ratify it.</p>
<p class="contents">The US actions in the Security Council will not in themselves threaten the mission in Bosnia, but indicate the seriousness of America's concerns, the most important of which is the possible prosecution of its civilian and military leaders for serious crimes committed abroad by its military personnel. The expanded definition of war crimes included in the statute and the much looser definition of command responsibility, looser than at Nuremberg, mean that it is very possible that Donald Rumsfeld or his successor, on a visit to Paris, might find himself under arrest for crimes committed by his subordinates, which he did not participate in, did not give the order for, or even have foreknowledge of, and for which there would be no question of his being tried in an American court.</p>
<p class="contents">Some might find that contrary to natural justice but there is no doubt that liberal governments and exponents of international civil society and universal jurisdiction such as Amnesty have fully supported the coming into being of the ICC, whilst ensuring a minimum of public debate over its flaws and its ability to cause political mischief for the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other problems. It is at least arguable that terrorists will be excluded from some of its provisions and there is a danger that justice will take precedence over amnesties that deliver long sought-after peace and reconciliation in countries such as Angola, South Africa, Sri Lanka or Colombia, to name but a few.</p>

Such a herring invasion seems to me to be so much more beneficial for the goodwill of the international coalition against terrorism than the threat to invade Europe, if necessary, to release American military accused of crimes against humanity and brought to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which opened its doors this Monday, and is backed by 133 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the United States would like to put its peace keepers and military above the law, which militates against respect for the Rule of Law, and this despite the fact that the treaty unquestionably hands the responsibility to investigate and take action initially to the country that supplies peace keepers. The International Criminal Court is a last resort, essentially to penalise war criminals and also leaders of those regimes that commit crimes against humanity. By tolerating the existence of international lawlessness, we undermine a credible coalition against terrorism, the very object of the exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">If being a super power means being above the law, then we are clearly on the wrong track. The United States is playing with fire. So all the more reason why Europe should take a tough stance, tougher than that stated by Mr Haarder a moment ago, in order to put our ally under diplomatic pressure. In this, Europe must speak with one voice, and emphasise a broad concept of security and key emphases, such as prevention and civilian elements. President Bush sometimes wants to play the cowboy at international level, but risks turning his own peacekeepers into outlaws in the process. This does not fit in very well with the historic American tradition in accordance with which the Rule of Law currently applies to everyone, irrespective of creed, race and origin. This should also apply to Americans worldwide. This is why we need an international coalition, and this is where the International Criminal Court in The Hague comes in.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush, I am making an urgent appeal to you, as commander-in-chief, to return to the international coalition for the worldwide Rule of Law. You are most welcome on our beaches, and we will offer you our first Dutch herring with pleasure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nearly four years after 120 countries rubberstamped the Rome Statute and the establishment of the Court, it opened its doors in The Hague yesterday, on 1 July 2002. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is fortunately a staunch supporter of the Criminal Court, but the United States is its most radical opponent. The Americans are now running a campaign against the Court in order to prevent its own citizens or military from ever being able to be taken before the Court, and they do not stop short of threats, for example by showing their willingness, if necessary, to sacrifice the entire UN police force in Bosnia for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My group emphatically rejects the campaign by the United States against the International Criminal Court. The so-called ‘Hague invasion act’ is a serious violation of the agreements between the NATO allies. At one time, back in 1945, the Americans were our liberators, and now they are threatening to invade Scheveningen. I too would gladly present them with Dutch new herring, Mr Van den Berg.</p>
<p class="contents">Why exactly are the Americans kicking up such a fuss? Does the American administration not believe in its own legal system? After all, the Court is only activated when the country in question takes no, or insufficient, action in trying crime. </p>
<p class="contents">However, two things should be prevented by Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">This week, it transpired that the UN mission in Bosnia is at stake. </p>
<p class="contents">My group deeply regrets this dramatic step which jeopardises the UN peacekeeping operations in general. It was therefore appropriate for NATO to hold an emergency meeting, but at this moment in time, a practical solution to Bosnia appears imminent; this conflict, however, may in no circumstances compromise future UN peacekeeping actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This immediately brings me to my last point. The conflict surrounding the Criminal Court could widen the gap between the European Union and the United States. I call on both the Council of Ministers under the Danish Presidency and the Commission to make every effort in order to keep relations with the US as smooth as possible in the interest of us both and the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is used as a lever to demand that American military personnel be immune to international prosecution for war crimes. As a result, we seem to overlook the fact that the conflict started with the US threatening an EU Member State because that is where the International Criminal Court is based. As early as the beginning of June, the American Senate decided in favour of the possibility of a military invasion in the Netherlands in order to release American prisoners in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">After the refusal to sign the Kyoto Climate Treaty or decommission chemical and bacteriological weapons and after the taxation on steel imports, this is the umpteenth time the US Government has flown in the face of the entire world. It demands cooperation and discipline from others in the fight against terrorism, but America itself does as it pleases. It is high time that we in Europe realised that it is impossible to make or maintain close cooperation agreements with a country or government of that kind. I have a feeling Mr Haarder underestimates this growing gap. If we go about it in this way, Europe will eventually have to give in to the US, and this is the worst possible scenario. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the war, it was the United States which played a key role in the creation of a world order through the establishment of international institutions. Indeed, at that time, international justice was the watchword. Today, it is the United States which – through its withdrawal from international treaties – is challenging the acceptance of internationally valid rights and duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office, and indeed all of us, why this is the case. There is a reason for it, and I have a document in front of me, dated August 2000, entitled "The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2000: Implications for US cooperation with the ICC". Indeed, I wonder why we are holding this debate today. We set up an early warning system several years ago, but it does not appear to function. It would seem that regular talks are taking place, but the analytical methods appear to vary, we do not seem to be listening, we do not seem to be assessing each other's problems in time, and nor do we appear to be genuinely listening to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the problem, then? I would ask you all, especially the Council Presidency but also the Commission, to ensure that the early warning system functions in time. I think that the proposal put forward by Mrs Maes is excellent. We should indeed point out at forthcoming meetings with the Americans that we need better systems and make sure that they actually work in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am afraid of is not a transatlantic divide, which we have been discussing, but a transatlantic clash, and I am dubious about the much-vaunted common values which we are always talking about. I would urge you, Mr President-in-Office and Commissioner Byrne, to take this point very seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an institution in the service of humanitarianism, which will bring war criminals before the court, impose sentences for genocide and punish international perpetrators of violence. The fact that the US has not signed up to this and is trying to oppose it is both incomprehensible and tragic. Carrying out such a unilateral and dangerous power policy not only undermines relations with Europe, but also – which is worse – jeopardises and weakens the International Criminal Court. In addition, the credibility of the UN and the worldwide community is weakened, along with their ability to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the US definitively submitted a new resolution to the UN Security Council regarding Article 16, a resolution which it appears the United Kingdom also intends to support. According to the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, this new proposal threatens vital elements of the Rome Statute. I appeal to the Commission and the Council to urge the Member States to stand by the decisions taken and stand up for the UN and the ICC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We note with great satisfaction that the Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July this year. In 1998, 120 states voted in favour of such a court – only seven opposed it, including the US. Seventy-six states have now ratified the statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The court will constitute a vital tool for strengthening international law through legal instruments. No country, no leader, no government can avoid prosecution for serious breaches of international law such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is surprising that a country with such a long legal tradition and so many lawyers per square metre as the US can consider exempting <span class="italic">its</span> citizens from liability to prosecution for such serious crimes. What does the US have to hide? What criminals is it trying to protect?</p>
<p class="contents">Exempting peacekeeping forces from such liability to prosecution would be devastating for women. This would in effect legalise rape, sexual assault and forced pregnancy, which unfortunately also occur with peacekeeping forces. The action of the US sends serious signals to the world.

Europe as a whole urges the Americans to reconsider this matter. We cannot understand the Americans, and we appeal to them as friends. We view the matter very seriously. We shall do everything to influence the United States, and I am able to inform Mrs Mann that the Council did in fact use its Early Warning System, but that, in the event, it did not work. The Council and its members are now continuing the work, for example during the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that so many people have also mentioned the common values that link the two sides of the Atlantic. We must not impute more far-reaching motives to the United States than it actually possesses. We must also note that the United States has clearly repudiated all notions of an invasion of the Netherlands. Nor has the United States expressed any desire to undermine the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task now is to maintain the firm support that exists for the International Criminal Court and to ensure that it is able to function and that the UN peacekeeping operations can continue to be carried out effectively, that is to say with American participation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the pressing problem of the UN police force in Bosnia, we have, as is well known, agreed to take over the force on 1 January 2003, and I should like to say to Mr Lagendijk that if, as a result of this conflict, we were to take over the police force earlier, the Council would also find the money to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would turn last of all to Mrs Mann whose commitment in the US delegation I myself have witnessed. There are good reasons why the US delegation should consider how the Early Warning System discussed in this delegation can be improved. The initiative we are debating today came of course from the US parliament – or, rather, Congress – and I therefore think that all Mrs Mann’s observations were particularly relevant. I must otherwise refrain from giving Parliament good advice, however. I just wanted to commend both Mrs Mann and the efforts being made in Parliament’s US delegation to improve relations with the American Congress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number of speakers raised particular issues to which I should like to respond. Mrs Bonino asked "what steps next" and specifically referred to the cost aspect. Of course it would be a very serious issue if problems arose with the UN mandate for peacekeeping. Clearly this will have to be addressed, particularly the cost aspect. I know that there are debates under way and considerations being examined at this time in relation to this issue. A solution will have to be sought, but a good one will be hard to find.</p>
