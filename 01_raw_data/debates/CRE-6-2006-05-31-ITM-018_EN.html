<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Werner Langen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, we have before us the report on the enlargement of the euro zone. It is based on the Commission’s second report, which appraises the state of practical preparations and entry status of individual Member States. I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Commissioner Almunia for the clarity of his report and of his stance, and I make a point of saying this because a year ago, during the review of the Stability and Growth Pact, I was rather inclined to think of the Commission as too compliant.</p>
<p class="contents">You have adopted a very clear position, and for that you have my wholehearted thanks. Following the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and those conducted within political groups, as well as the agreements made amongst the groups, I am convinced that the Commission’s stance will be largely supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has been successful across the board, since it has ensured monetary stability both within the euro zone, with low rates of inflation, and in relation to outside currencies. This is only possible if we observe not only the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty but also the Stability and Growth Pact. Given that the two largest states of the euro zone, France and Germany, have remained in contravention of the stability pact for years on end without finding the necessary inner strength to enact essential reforms, it is imperative that we, in this current phase involving the entry of Member States with a derogation, fulfil the conditions of the Maastricht Treaty to the letter.</p>
<p class="contents">We have twelve euro zone members and eleven states with a derogation; Britain and Denmark have a special ‘opt-out’ status. That is something else again, and they can always reconsider what they want to do. All the others are compelled to accept the supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and the appraisal of their level of convergence. The Commission has done these things carefully and rigorously, and for this, too, I offer my most sincere thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference, which was not evident to all here in Parliament – even in discussions within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – is that, under the Regulations of 1997, both members of the euro zone and states with a derogation are subject to supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and to coordination of their economic policies. Within the euro zone this is achieved through stability programmes, while states with a derogation have convergence programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, after lengthy debates, we have adopted a report which is strongly guided by the Maastricht Treaty in terms of entry criteria, which are as follows: price stability; a candidate for entry must have a rate of inflation no more than 1.5% higher than that of the three best EU Member States. As regards public finances, the level of debt must not exceed 60% of GDP, with a 3% ceiling for new debts. I sometimes get the impression that the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are being misinterpreted. And then we have the adherence to ERM II for two years, interest-rate convergence, legislative compatibility, an independent central bank and economic convergence. I am convinced that premature introduction of the euro is detrimental to the Member States, since real convergence and financial, economic and monetary stability are essential when determining the ultimate exchange rate so that an accession candidate, having entered and no longer being able to devalue or revalue, does not default.</p>
<p class="contents">We deliberated and agreed that countries would not be named, but that we wanted, on the other hand, to enter into discussions with the Commission and the European Central Bank on the setting of the rate of inflation, another area in which differences exist. The European Central Bank has defined a value close to 2% as price stability for the evaluation of its monetary policy, and we are keen to become fully involved in this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided, moreover, that we do not wish any one of the candidate countries to be given special rebates, but that we place great value on equal and proper treatment for all, be they new or old Members. We also do not wish the experience of the first accession phase, involving the entry of Greece on the basis of incomplete data and Italy before completion of two years’ compliance with the ERM fluctuation margins, to be taken as a precedent for the enlargement of the euro zone; we wish instead to encourage the Commission to be impartial and true to the Maastricht Treaty in the assessments it delivers. You will appreciate, Commissioner, that our wish is for greater transparency. I am grateful for the constructive cooperation of my fellow Members. In the end, I feel that the report we have developed and refined is a good one which will have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues here and which in turn emphatically endorses the Commissioner’s stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to look after all of the countries which do not yet belong to the eurozone but which wish to and which are obliged to join, because all of the Member States, except those with an opt-out clause the United Kingdom and Denmark have the right to belong to the eurozone, but also the obligation to join it and to prepare themselves for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the aspects dealt with in the report that led to yours, on the preparations of the Member States that will join the eurozone over the coming years, are very important. I must tell you that, over the coming weeks, we are going to approve a new report, because from now on those reports will be published by the Commission every six months, rather than every year.</p>
<p class="contents">They are preparations of a technical nature, which are very important in terms of keeping public opinion informed and trying to prevent the kind of abuse in the exchange between the national currency and the single currency that has happened in the past in certain cases. We are learning from past experiences in order to cooperate with the candidates to join the euro, in order to prevent that abuse and in order to convince the citizens that moving from their national currency to the euro has no direct relationship with price rises, which can easily be avoided. Of course, the candidates for joining the eurozone must prepare themselves for fulfilling the criteria laid down in the Treaty, since the Treaty of Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has focussed more on this last aspect, because, as you know, a few weeks ago the Commission and the European Central Bank adopted convergence reports in response to the requests of Slovenia and Lithuania. In those reports, the Commission – and the European Central Bank – gave their interpretation of the application of the criteria laid down in the Treaty. I would insist that they are laid down in the Treaty, they are not defined by the European Commission artificially or on a whim. The criteria in the Treaty cannot be changed. Our obligation, therefore – and we have done this on other occasions and we will do so in the future – is to apply the Treaty and to apply it rigorously, since that is the only way to guarantee equal treatment for each and every Member State seeking to join the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The most obvious discussion relates to the inflation criterion. Mr Langen talked about the criterion of the European Central Bank for maintaining price stability. I must tell you that it is not the same: the European Central Bank’s objective of maintaining price stability in the eurozone below 2% inflation, but close to it, is one thing, but the Treaty’s inflation criterion, which states that candidates for joining the eurozone must have an average inflation rate over the last twelve months below the reference value, which is the inflation of the three best performing countries in terms of inflation, plus 1.5%, is quite another.</p>
<p class="contents">This is laid down clearly in the Treaty. The Commission cannot alter the criteria in the Treaty; we have the duty to see them applied and that is what we have done. Since I have noted from certain comments in the report or in the amendments that the Commission is being asked for transparency in the way the Treaty is interpreted and applied, I am at Parliament’s service, not just to explain the convergence reports on Slovenia and Lithuania in detail, but also, if you wish, to provide the additional documentation on which the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 16 May is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has always been our policy, and it still is our policy. In addition, it has been the policy of the Group of the European People’s Party throughout recent years to fight for a strong euro in line with the Maastricht criteria and accompanied by strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved – France, Italy and Germany. We will therefore continue this policy in pursuit of a stable euro and so would like to assure the Commission of our unequivocal support for the clear stance it has taken on the question of our future approach to enlargement of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once again that we are very clearly in favour of new Member States entering the euro zone; this must, however, take place in accordance with particular criteria; we have a certain amount of tradition and rigour to uphold in this respect. So, once again, our heartfelt thanks to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I would like to encourage the Commission to be more assertive <span class="italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Member States when it comes to data. It has the support of Parliament. I also encourage the Member States to grant the Commission more rights in relation to the verification of data pertaining to potential entry. I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation. It must therefore be given greater access to information, and this requires the Member States to be more cooperative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports this notion.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions for joining the euro zone are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty in the form of so-called ‘nominal convergence criteria’. These criteria must be fulfilled in order to join the common currency area, and fulfilment of them is sufficient in order to do so. However, there have been attempts to impose additional conditions on the new Member States, such as ‘real convergence’, or the ‘euro zone absorption capacity’, which has not been defined in detail. These criteria do not exist in the Maastricht Treaty, and so they cannot be applied. There must be no double standards when it comes to new and old Member States. If we fully agree that the provisions of the Treaty must be respected, we should abide by the rule that we are bound by the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the convergence criteria give rise to a whole series of reasonable doubts as regards economic factors and interpretation. These problems became glaringly obvious in the recent convergence reports on Lithuania and Slovenia. The definition of price stability that the European Commission and the European Central Bank used in their reports assessing fulfilment of the inflation criteria was contrary to the definition of price stability that the ECB applies in its monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Other aspects of the assessment are also dubious. This is not a minor matter, because on the basis of the assessment Lithuania was not given a positive recommendation by the Commission for joining the euro zone. This situation gives cause for concern, because the European Commission’s decisions must be reliable and should not give rise to doubts concerning partisanship or lack of objectivity. The rules used when assessing individual Member States must be clear, and the decision-making process must be totally transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the convergence criteria formulated 15 years ago, when the Member States still had national currencies and separate monetary policies, should be adapted to the current situation, in which the new Member States are joining an existing common currency area. This requires appropriate amendments to the relevant provisions of Article 121 of the Treaty and the Protocol to the Treaty. I ask for a debate to be opened on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now those problems will have to be solved during the actual process of expansion, and the Commission is not ready for this. But we do not think we should blame one another. From our experience of reforms, we know that satisfactory results can also be achieved in such a way; we simply have to react quickly to the changing situation. Therefore, I would like European institutions to react quickly to the changing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious, that preparation for the introduction of the Euro involves substantial expenditure; therefore, the assessment of candidate countries must be carried out not half a year before introducing the Euro, but much earlier, perhaps in a few stages.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the opinion that we must review the calculation methodology of the Maastricht inflation criteria. After all, we reviewed the Stability and Growth Pact methodology without any difficulties. I trust that this was not because a large country requested it. The voice of small countries must also be heard.</p>

What objections could be made to an obligation to rigorously observe the Treaty’s conditions? This is just as it should be, and personally I am in favour of this position. If this approach had been consistently adopted, however, then the history of the euro zone’s creation would have been significantly different, and it is even possible that the number of states that are currently members of the euro zone would differ. A third of the current members of the euro zone joined it whilst in breach of one or other of the criteria. In reality, the admission criteria were only used as reference points, and political decisions were the real deciding force. This is not surprising, since in many cases the economic foundation of the criteria is very questionable. Thus, for example, the permissible inflation level was also set by reference to countries that are not in the euro zone and, most paradoxical of all, the best inflation indicators differ from the European Central Bank’s vision concerning the best level of price stability in the euro zone. The demand for countries to achieve exchange rate stability together with the inflation indicators makes this criterion even more contradictory. The European Central Bank does not even claim to bring this about in the euro zone. Concerns expressed in the report concerning potential problems with the applicant countries following accession to the euro zone cannot be attributed to the small, flexible economies of, for example, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which are also open economies and have since the beginning of the 1990s had experience of exchange rates fixed over the long term. If Lithuania, with its trifling divergence from the inflation criterion, is not accepted into the euro zone, then that is obviously a political decision. I would support the report if it were truly focused on the improvement of the admission criteria in the future. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Rather, what we can detect in the report is the theme of the notorious Polish plumber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a number of years now the country has achieved good economic results which would be a cause for jubilation in the vast majority of euro zone countries. Lithuania has achieved robust long-term economic growth approaching 10% of the GDP. For a long time, and with a great deal to spare, it has also met the Maastricht criteria for the public spending deficit, for public sector debt and long-term interest rates, unlike most of the euro zone countries. In only one criterion did the country exceed the 2.6% reference level by one tenth of a percent in the last evaluation period, although it had met the target for several years before that.</p>
<p class="contents">My friends, joining the euro zone should not be like an athletics event, where a one-tenth measure decides on whether you qualify or not.

Firstly, the report quite clearly states that new Member States must meet all the Maastricht criteria before they can join the euro zone. At the same time it passes over the fact that when the euro was introduced, many old Member States did not meet these criteria. Once again the political signal being sent out is that some are more equal than others in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, since the introduction of the euro in 2002, at least five countries, including the largest – Germany, France and Italy – have not complied with the most important criteria, and have been unable to keep their budget deficits and public debt under control. In some of these countries, public debt greatly exceeds 60% of GDP, which means they will have to restrict it for many years to come. Despite this the continued membership of these countries in the monetary and currency union not only continues unquestioned, but nobody is making any particular effort to force these countries to change the current state of affairs. The recent amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact which benefited Germany and France are glaring examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and in view of this situation, the rejection of Lithuania’s application to join the euro zone as of 1 January 2007, merely because it exceeded the inflation indicator by 0.1%, may at the very least cause confusion and bodes no good for the debate on enlargement of the euro zone to include all the new Member States, or on the accession to this zone of the United Kingdom, Denmark or Sweden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank them for their contributions, regardless of whether they agree with the Commission’s views on the issues that we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say four things: firstly, that the Commission is, of course, in favour of enlarging the eurozone. There is no other option: the Member States have that right and obligation, and we respect that right and demand compliance with that obligation. We do so regardless of whether those who are to join the eurozone over the coming years are new or old Member States – a distinction which we believe belongs in the past – or whether they be large or small, rich or not so rich.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to come up with any new conditions, Mr Rosati: we are applying the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty. That is the only way to ensure that everybody is treated equally, and I do not imagine – and I am sure that none of you wishes to do so – that anybody in this House would ask the Commission not to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaty and not to apply the Treaty equally to each and every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Treaty be modified? Of course. This afternoon I have had the opportunity to attend the debate at which Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the future Constitution, the necessary changes and the future of Europe. Of course the Treaty can be changed, and it will be changed eventually. But for now we have to apply the existing Treaty, and you know, just as I do, that it is not for the Commission to change the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Treaty say about the inflation criterion, which has been discussed in the debate? It says that the reference value consists of the average inflation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation. It does not say ‘members of the eurozone’. It clearly says ‘Member States’: all of them, including those with an opt-out clause; we cannot exclude any Member State from the calculation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation. And we must add 1.5% to that average of the three: that is the reference value.</p>
<p class="contents">Something quite different is the figure defined by the European Central Bank, independently, as an objective within the context of its mandate, which is to ensure price stability. It is not the same, and there is no reason why it should be, and in this debate we must not confuse the European Central Bank’s inflation objective with the reference value of the Treaty's inflation criterion. They are completely different things.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty's inflation criterion says something else though: it also says that the inflation of the Member State in question must be sustainable. Some of you talk about a small difference, and it is true. In the inflation criterion, however, in addition to the difference, in addition to the comparison between the inflation of the Member State and the reference value, the Treaty states that we must analyse whether or not the inflation of the Member State in question is sustainable. We cannot ignore the Treaty, and we are not going to. We are going to explain it over and over again, because rigorously analysing the criteria is not in the interest of the Sates currently in the eurozone, but of the Member State that is a candidate to join the eurozone; because, if we do not do so, that State will have to suffer the consequences once the decision to join the euro is irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">References to the past are not of any use to me, therefore. If things were not done perfectly in the past, then somebody is paying for the consequences today. Let us learn from experience, since that is what rational and reasonable politicians should do. We apply the Treaty, but we apply all aspects of it, not just the bits that are in our interest, and when applying it, we learn from our experience, within the margin for interpretation permitted by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Lithuania, I am not going to deny the obvious, of course: its economic results are magnificent. The efforts it has made to improve its economic situation are extraordinary. We all want Lithuania to fulfil all of the Treaty’s criteria as soon as possible. Today it has been able to fulfil all of them but one; let us hope that it overcomes that difference very soon. As soon as it does so, I will be looking forward to receiving a request from Lithuania which is its right pursuant to the Treaty so that I can issue a favourable opinion on behalf of the Commission. But please do not ask the Commission to say anything in the convergence reports that goes against a rational, clear and transparent application of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we know, and the Langen report confirms this, joining the euro requires ‘total compliance with the Maastricht criteria’, which implies meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, and observing the guidelines of the European Central Bank, the European monetary authority whose decisions have an impact throughout economic life.</p>
<p class="contents">The report expressly states that ‘Euro changeover should not be tackled and projected as simply a technical change in currency but as a major conversion with significant economic, monetary and social effects’. It highlights Parliament’s maximalist approach, which is that the budgetary cycle at national level needs to be synchronised and based on the same prerogatives, namely the loss of monetary, and in turn fiscal, sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in Portugal we are very familiar with this situation and its effects, as confirmed by the recent spring 2006-2007 economic forecasts. The loss of monetary sovereignty has ramifications for the real convergence of economies, serving the economic groups, directly or indirectly.</p>

The verdict, not surprisingly, was a loud and clear ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now two years since ten new Member States joined the EU. The state of opinion in those countries in relation to the euro varies from country to country. Replacing a currency is, however, an incredibly important and serious matter. It is not just a question of changing coins and notes, but also of giving up a part of your independence. By extension, you lose the ability to control your own economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The June List believes that the people must be consulted when decisions of this importance, such as in relation to a new draft Constitution or the euro, are to be taken. For the sake of democracy, it would be best if referendums were arranged – if that is what the people want – in those countries intending to introduce the euro as legal tender. The result of these referendums must then be respected, just like the people of Sweden’s ‘no’ to the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
