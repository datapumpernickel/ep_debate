Needless to say, we are very disappointed at the second arbitration award issued on 22 October 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The current import regime for bananas was agreed at Doha in 2001. On this basis we obtained a waiver from our WTO obligations for granting a preference to our ACP partners. It was also agreed at the time that we would move to a tariff-only system not later than 1 January 2006. For this purpose we opened negotiations with our main trading partners for modifying the concessions in our schedule on bananas and went through arbitration as foreseen in the annex to the Doha waiver. The relevant benchmark set out in the annex to the Doha waiver is whether the rebinding of our tariff on bananas maintains market access for most-favoured-nation suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a first negative award on 1 August 2005, the arbitrator determined in a second award issued on 27 October that the European Community had failed to rectify the matter with its proposal for a new most-favoured-nation tariff rate at EUR 187 per tonne. This was a very disappointing result. Our calculations were done in an objective and transparent manner and were supported by thorough economic and legal analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim has always been to ensure a neutral modification of the import regime with a most-favoured-nation tariff that provides equivalent market access conditions to let in American suppliers – as the current quota regime does – and keeps an equivalent level of ACP preference. Throughout this process we had consultations with our trading partners but there were no common positions from their side that could have been the basis for a negotiated solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Where does that leave us now? The arbitrator’s award does not indicate what could be an appropriate tariff level. In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account: most importantly, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders. We have considered the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to its future reform. We have our commitments towards the ACP partners in the Cotonou Agreement to maintain their tariff preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all the above, we need to move to a tariff-only system from 1 January 2006 and we must move quickly as our operators need legal certainty. At the same time, I am fully aware of our responsibilities towards all stakeholders, which we take very seriously. The Commission will therefore be making a proposal very shortly on the level of the tariff starting from 1 January 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before leaving his post, Commissioner Lamy informed us, on 21 April 2004, that he intended to propose a tariff of EUR 230 per tonne of bananas imported. Since then, since the new Commission took office, both you and your colleagues and the Commissioner for Trade have sought to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You must acknowledge, Commissioner, that what you have said tonight does not shed much light on the direction you intend to take. You must clearly take the decision to apply a tariff from 1 January and we shall see how high it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, you are very well aware – the Commission is very well aware – that that decision guarantees you a new dispute with the producer countries of the ‘dollar area’ within the WTO almost immediately if that tariff exceeds their expectations. In other words, we shall gain a few months of time at the expense of creating certain risks for the ACP group of countries and new uncertainties for our European producers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, provided that nothing unexpected emerges from the imminent Hong Kong Summit, the Commission will have to seek a negotiated solution with the Latin American banana-producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The legitimate question I would like to ask is why the Commission expressly gave up the search for that agreement during the months of March, April and May, when there is reliable evidence that, via various diplomatic channels, the Latin American producers sought an agreement, though of a transitional nature, on a temporary extension of the system in force which would provide a margin for the negotiation of a more stable and lasting solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that the Commission did not pay any attention to these wishes because, at that time, it was confident that the arbitration within the World Trade Organisation could agree to the establishment of a tariff of EUR 230. That was our first setback.</p>
<p class="contents">Then a new tariff of EUR 187 was proposed, with identical results. You have confirmed here today that you are very disappointed by the result of the second arbitration of 27 October. At that time, the comments of certain officials, and your own comments, Commissioner, showed the same perplexity and disappointment that you have expressed today.</p>
<p class="contents">You said then that it was necessary to prevent the banana dispute from being included on the Hong Kong agenda. I believe that this is another mistake, Commissioner. All it needed was for a country such as Honduras, which may be many good things, but is hardly an all-powerful giant of a country, to ask that the banana dispute be included on the agenda of the Hong Kong Summit, in order to achieve what the Commission wanted to prevent at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">You may feel reassured to know, Commissioner, that, during this final stage of the negotiation, with so much disappointment and bad news in terms of our interests, you have not been alone. You have been accompanied by certain national governments, such as that of my own country, and the governments of certain banana-producing regions. You have also had the understanding of certain representatives of the European banana producers, who appear to be resigned to awaiting a solution, which you have mentioned in your speech, involving a magic formula such as the one achieved in the so-called ‘Madeira Agreements’, which for the moment just has the air of a Portuguese <span class="italic">fado</span>, which, as you know, Commissioner, is more a song of nostalgia and sadness than one of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You showed how disappointed you are, which is no surprise after a second negative arbitration decision. That is no pleasure, but I can tell you after looking at the website that the story of bananas is a never-ending one; so you should not be too disappointed. I am sure this issue will be with us for many more years to come and even if this is resolved, another one will come up. That seems to be inherent in the case of bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe you could be a little more precise and explain the timeframe for action. There is not a lot of time left, but I would like to know what timeframe you have in mind. Secondly, what are the different scenarios you are evaluating? For the Committee on International Trade, it would be more than relevant to know what you have in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as my colleague said, I wonder whether this is not going to overshadow Hong Kong. I would like to know how you are going to make a situation that is not easy in any case – given that sugar and many other difficult issues are on the agenda – look a little more positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same can, I might add, be said of sugar, which is a good example, although here in Europe – with the possible exception of our peripheral areas – we produce hardly any bananas. The situation is, then, better than it was at the time the Soviet Union disintegrated and Germany was united. When the central and eastern European states acceded to the European Union, West Germany’s former suppliers – the producers of dollar bananas – thought they could now supply the rest of the EU. ‘With this common market organisation’, they thought to themselves, ‘which was not there before, there will now be free trade in bananas, and we will be able to offload our dollar bananas throughout the EU’s territory, and let the others look after themselves.’</p>
<p class="contents">This House, at the time, debated this in depth. In those days, the Commission was on our side, and we worked out a proper market organisation, which is now becoming the subject of recurrent debate. It is not the case that the dollar bananas have done anything like cede any of the market and that the Americans are doing less business; the very opposite has happened, and their share has increased dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, we had not introduced these criteria and had no quotas, the ACP countries, with their so-called small bananas, would have been out of business ages ago, and hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of small banana farmers would have lost their livelihoods. They are not yet exactly out of danger, but at least we have, by holding this debate, made our contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would welcome from you – and I am also thinking of sugar here – is that this debate should go forward in the European Union, and that, instead of liberalisation being simply proposed as a quantative solution while policy and social and environmental concerns are disregarded, the Commission, as an advocate for these quality criteria, should speak up clearly and ensure that social, labour, and environmental concerns should be brought to bear on global trade relationships and be taken into account in them. That is most particularly the case where the use of quotas is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the 1980s, cooperatives of small farmers in the developing world and non-commercial import organisations in Europe have struck up good working relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Over half the bananas eaten in Switzerland originate from imports based on fair trade. The key factor is not the country of origin, but the method of production that protects man and the environment. In contrast to Switzerland, the success of fair trade in the EU is hindered by a tradition of quotas and levies. This means that it is difficult to import bananas from countries other than those in Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific Ocean, or, to put it another way, those countries that were colonies of the Member States up to half a century ago, unless they fall within the scope of import licences held by a number of big undertakings in Europe and America.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question I would like to put to the Commission. Will it, after this arbitration, create room for a transition to the Swiss model or will volume restrictions only be replaced by higher import tariffs, which means that little will change, if anything? In that case, the Latin American countries will regard Europe as being in breach of its agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another EU import tariff scheme has come unstuck: recently sugar, now bananas, and all for pan-EU harmony. This scheme is hampered by the origins of Member States, many of whose former colonies produce bananas and whom they now rightly wish to assist. Although complex, the three-tariff system helped, with the C quota reserved for ACP countries to export up to 750 000 tonnes annually to the EU at zero rate. Hence the problem: because non-EU countries, especially Latin America, now want parity.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest two solutions. We can go to tariff only, as proposed for 2006. In October 2004, EUR 230 per tonne was suggested, but that was too low for ACP and too high for dollar countries. However a common tariff is set up, it will disadvantage ACP countries, causing loss of production and unemployment. Already the Windward Isles report that 24 000 small producers have dropped to 7 000 under dollar-country pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">In many ACP countries bananas grow in terrain unsuitable for other crops, so unemployment grows massively. Will these people migrate, some to Europe adding to our 20 million unemployed, or will they take to crops like cocaine that will grow on the former banana plantations?</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest an alternative solution based on the repeated statements that we are supposed to be in an EU which retains its individual Member State status. Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut. Combine the two: ditch the banana import scheme and make individual Member States sort themselves out with their own arrangements. After all, we are all grown-up democracies. EU countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish, without repercussions on the world market. The UK operated Commonwealth preference up to 1972 without great problems. If that sounds a little nostalgic, well, why not? We owe these former colonies. What is wrong with a little humanity in trying to maintain employment in the Third World? Rather that than the arid scratchings of the bureaucratic Brussels pen-pusher. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1993, the Union decided to establish its own import regime and a common organisation of the market for bananas that is completely different to the common organisation of the market that governs the rest of the fruit and vegetable sector. The Union therefore gave the banana sector special treatment, almost favourable treatment, and this is even more justified today, because this fruit is only grown in the European Union’s outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that, because of their island and outlying status, these regions are treated differently, and this is necessary, above all, if we want to continue to maintain their agricultural activity. Given that my government, the Spanish Government, has forgotten this – as has the Government of the Canary Islands it would appear – I will point out that bananas play an essential economic and social role and the new import regime could jeopardise the survival of Community production if the European Union does not have sufficient funds in the future to compensate for a drastic reduction in prices as a result of the possible establishment of too low a border tariff.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of the problem is ultimately an accounting adjustment on which the future of the banana sector in the European Union depends. The lower the tariff, the greater the financial effort required to compensate European producers will be. But that effort has a maximum limit and that maximum limit should determine the European Union’s room for manoeuvre in terms of giving in to international pressures in international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has already sacrificed a significant proportion of its agricultural production for the sake of opening up to international trade, a sacrifice which unfortunately always impacts on the same people, on the producers, and which benefits just a few, in a very small number of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of bananas, moreover, the big multinationals would benefit, while local producers will hardly notice the change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reality – as others have said – is that, for instance in the Windward Islands, bananas provide employment for over a third of the working population and account for 50 to 70% of export earnings. It would be extremely serious if that were to be jeopardised. As you suggested, Commissioner, preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">The best approach would be to find ways of postponing the single tariff, and to negotiate and agree to a fair solution that allows all suppliers to continue to trade. Arbitration has obviously been a failure, but the Commission must try to ensure that the trade can continue until such time as you, in conjunction with the Development and Trade Commissioners, can find a viable way of ensuring that other sources of income can be found for poor farmers in the Windward Islands so that they continue to have a future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I fear that bananas and sugar will be well and truly on the agenda in Hong Kong as far as the ACP countries are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that banana production in the European Union is currently significant, that thousands of European Union families living in the outermost regions live from it and that, if banana production were to disappear, we would be abandoning some of Europe’s islands to their fate, despite the fact that, although they are far away, they are as European as the place from which I am speaking at this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that we must bear in mind that the panels of the World Trade Organisation cannot choose arbitrarily. According to the principles of the Charter of the World Trade Organisation, an equivalent tariff must be sought, and that equivalent tariff is not arbitrary; it must provide us with at least the same level of protection that we enjoyed previously. I do not know to what extent the Commission is considering this factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, time is running out. 1 January is just around the corner and I very much fear that, as a result of the ‘trial and error’ procedure being employed by the panels of the World Trade Organisation, we will not have a tariff on 1 January. Should we not consider the possibility that, at least during the transitional period, the regime in force could be maintained? Can the Commission negotiate in any way with the third countries to suspend or interrupt the negotiation, with a view to reaching a reasonable solution?</p>
<p class="contents">I am finally going to make a comment on the things my compatriots from the Spanish Peoples’ Party have said. Until last year, the Peoples’ Party was in power in Spain and until a few months ago, before its expulsion by the Head of the Government, it was in power in the Canary Islands. The question I wanted to ask is whether, until that time, the Peoples’ Party had been doing anything differently to the current governments of Spain and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, Commissioner, I hope that you will defend the interests of these hundreds of thousands of European citizens whose ability to maintain their living conditions depend on you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not yet actually finalised this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing some of the remarks made here today, firstly, it was a priority for me when we started these discussions immediately after I came into office last November to reach a negotiated conclusion on this issue. Yet it soon turned out that even within the Latin American countries there is no common agreement, so it was not possible to reach a negotiated conclusion on the issue in January. We tried over and over again to see whether it was possible. I will not go into details about the various big companies in the Latin American countries that hold completely opposite views on how this is will end, but do not believe those who say that negotiation possibilities have not been explored.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite right that Honduras has put bananas on the agenda for the Hong Kong ministerial conference. I can only say that we will do our utmost to ensure that this issue does not unduly disturb the whole process. To this end, we are counting on our approach being reasonable, on our continued preparedness to discuss with our partners and on the support of the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding sugar, which has also been mentioned, it is my intention to try to reach a political compromise in the Council at the meeting before the Hong Kong meeting, so that this will not be an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the timeframe and the different scenarios, there is currently a proposal on the table before the Council for moving to a tariff-only system and this will be the basis for further discussions. At this stage I cannot go into details, because this is issue will be dealt with and negotiated with the Council before I put all the figures and ideas on the table in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course our target is to get fair trade on this banana issue. The fact is that at the end of the day it is the consumers who decide what is going to be on the supermarket shelves, so those who have a huge interest in this issue should use any opportunity to encourage consumers to make their choice. As a number of speakers have mentioned, it is clear that we have to find a balance on this very delicate issue. In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account and, most importantly, as I said previously, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to consider the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to the reform that we will hopefully achieve with the Council during the second half of 2006. I can only assure those of you who have an interest in this difficult, long-lasting issue that we will do our utmost to arrive at a positive outcome so that the tariff-only system enters into force on 1 January 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
