<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenmarck (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, when, some months ago, we set the guidelines for the 2003 Budget, there was a great deal of agreement in Parliament concerning three priorities for category 5.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these concerned preparations for the forthcoming enlargement, the second concerned necessary institutional reforms and the third concerned the need to deal with everything within the framework of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">These are priorities which, for Parliament, must now be translated into figures and calculations in euros and cents. If, at its summit in Copenhagen in December, the European Council decides in favour of a ‘big bang’ whereby ten new countries will become members in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004, this will present extraordinarily large demands.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no greater challenge for the European Parliament than precisely this. If such an enlargement is to be possible, it will have to be possible for up to 147 observers to be in place from the beginning of 2003. With this in view, it is now proposed that EUR 6 million be placed in a reserve. It is estimated that the enlargement-related costs for 2003 will amount to just over EUR 32 million in total.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of a far-sighted policy, Parliament has for a long time been working single-mindedly to make the forthcoming enlargement possible. It is a task which is now continuing into the 2003 Budget. There is also a readiness in this Budget to bring certain costs for 2004 forward into the 2003 Budget. This sum amounts to EUR 51 million. In total, this means, in other words, a financial investment of EUR 89 million in the course of just a single budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is to be possible to cope with all this, enlargement must be given top priority by the European Parliament, and that must also have a visible effect on the budget work.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s own reform process is of the utmost significance and is priority number two. I believe that, in common with myself, a good many MEPs have heard remarks over the years along the lines that this is not a proper parliament. In many ways, that may once have been an accurate observation in the sense that the European Parliament did not have any real legislative power. Today, Parliament has power of co-decision in ever increasing areas. It is probably not difficult to predict that there will be a further increase in the use of this power.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is to be possible, Parliament must be strengthened in its key functions. We are talking here, then, about MEPs’ ability to exercise the power due to every Parliament in every democracy and relating to the budget, legislation and oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we continue to invest seriously in these functions, there will, in the future too, be many people who maintain that we are not a proper parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For precisely that reason, we must strengthen these areas, develop better follow-up of the budget and increase support for MEPs in the legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">If room for everything – the costs of enlargement and Parliament’s necessary reforms – is to be found within the framework of the third priority – that is to say, with ever greater expenses being dealt with within the established budget framework – a strict budget process is required. In spite of all the commitments entailed in the biggest enlargement in the EU’s history, the 2003 Budget will be managed within the 20% framework that has for a long time been Parliament’s portion of the common budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For next year, we are looking to a 1.6% increase, which has to be compared with an intended increase of, on average, 3.5% for all the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">When, a few months ago, we began work on the 2003 Budget, there was a large estimated deficit in category 5. A few months later, the majority of institutions responded positively to the challenges from Parliament and the Council to focus on the key activities and so reduce its estimates. When we now look at the Budget figures from other institutions, it appears in actual fact fully possible for us to be able successfully to manage our commitments within applicable frameworks without using any flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me finally to make a short technical correction. Paragraph 22 of the resolution quotes a sum of EUR 15.5 million for the buildings reserve. If it is accurately to reflect today’s decision, the amount should be adjusted somewhat so that Parliament remains under the ceiling of EUR 1 051 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am pleased to be the first to congratulate our rapporteur on putting together a package for the budget for 2003 for our Parliament. Many of the items included in his report are ones which we, as a group, can fully support. In particular the provisions concerning enlargement, especially the inclusion of observers and other provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, three points that still remain of concern to us. The first relates to an early-retirement scheme, which we would like to see applied in this institution as it is applied in others. We would like the Council to come forward with the right kind of conclusions so it can be included in the 2003 procedure. This, along with other reforms, will help to prepare our institution for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other items of greater concern which relate to the way in which the administration responds to the demands and consultation of parliamentarians. The first refers to the Interinstitutional Recruitment Office which we as a Parliament, and indeed as a Committee on Budgets, have been calling for for many months. We now find ourselves faced with a text but without the means either to amend or discuss it. We understand that Mr Gargani, as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has sent a letter this morning to the President stating that committee has concerns about legal administrative questions. My group also shares those concerns and therefore we support what Mr Stenmarck has put in his report, namely that we would like the relevant committee to have a report on this proposed recruitment office before a final decision is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we understand the Council wishes to amend this document and, therefore, we do not see why we, as parliamentarians, should not also have that right.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, buildings: my group has discussed the needs of enlargement so far as offices and so on are concerned, and we have put in a request. No decision has yet been taken in my group as to what buildings we need. Yet we understand that negotiations are in full swing for the construction of new buildings in Brussels, for which authorisation has been given neither politically nor in relation to the Committee on Budgets, since we have no documents available to us. This is why I have tabled an amendment, on behalf of my group, which calls for this question to be clarified. The Podestà report concerns translation and interpretation and there should be a report on buildings to indicate what commitments are needed, unlike in the past when Parliament has been faced with a fait accompli, and then had to sign up for the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, on these two items, we would like to see greater sensitivity on the part of the administration and the Bureau towards parliamentarians, because ultimately it is the Assembly that is sovereign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Stenmarck for his report. I agree with him that the estimates in front of us are critical in that they deal with Parliament's preparations for enlargement. We all know that this is the greatest enlargement the EU has faced, so it is critical that we get the preparations right in time for 2004. This is especially so in the current climate in which the EU seems to be needlessly coming under attack from all sides. Our credibility more than ever depends on getting this right. In this context the need for improved provision for information is imperative and I therefore support the 15% increase outlined in this report for this area. Bringing the work of the European Parliament closer to the people must be one of our top priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is increasingly evident that all the work we have been doing on information provision has not quite caught the imagination of the European public. I heard recently some evidence from the Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty which shows that citizens who went to Parliament or Commission information offices for literature were not sufficiently convinced or motivated to go out and vote. If this is indeed the case, we need a fundamental review of what we are publishing and how we are communicating with the people.</p>
<p class="contents">So what did encourage people to go out and vote? The source of information that encouraged people to go out and vote "yes" most effectively was conversations with friends and family. The clear message for us is that producing mountains of glossy brochures is not getting the message across. I, for one, am continually meeting people who are completely confused about the roles of the different institutions. We need, therefore, to recognise that we must have interinstitutional cooperation on information policy, and such cooperation has been quite slow to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of these issues may be dealt with by the convention and I know the Council is talking about opening up its decision-making process to permit greater transparency. However, we need to be more focused and targeted in our approach and I am not entirely convinced that the proposal in this report to broadcast Parliament's plenary part-sessions on the Internet, will really solve the problem. How many people will be inclined to sit at their computer and watch such broadcasts? Before we go down this particular road we should undertake a pilot study and look at the cost-value ratio of this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also extremely concerned about how the institutions are going to deal with proposals for funding the administrative costs. Commissioner Schreyer has informed us today that in the proposed PDB for 2003 on administrative expenditure there will be a negative margin of EUR 66 million. It is proposed to finalise this through the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I have enormous reservations about this, because my understanding of the flexibility instrument is that it is meant to be there for unforeseen events. How can we justify using this to the taxpayer for the administrative purposes which are known and have been foreseen for quite a long time? What happens if there is another crisis in the coming year? How will we fund measures to tackle it?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Schreyer also made a reference to pensions. I recognise that this is an area in which there has been a dramatic increase in terms of the provisions we need, given the demographic profile of staff in the institutions. Surely we need proposals for the long term which look at how we can provide for the pensions by setting up a fund or alternative means,.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of budgetary rigour is referred to time and time again. We want greater budgetary rigour, but there are two major issues that the Council needs to address if we are to achieve this, and it is a pity it is not here to listen to this: the first one is the issue of the language regime. The area most affected by enlargement within the institution will be staff and the building costs related to languages. Whilst I support the right of all MEPs to speak their own language, we must recognise that we need to rationalise this and we need to recognise the danger of a loss of dynamism in our meetings. The Council therefore needs to look at the Treaty provisions to see how we can rationalise this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of the seat of the European Parliament requires urgent attention. This fact alone has a major impact on costs. Surely it is time that Parliament has one seat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report also serves as a good basis for later discussion of the budget in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 budget is likely to be the last before EU enlargement. For that reason the rapporteur has set aside considerable sums of money for the new Member State’s admission to the EU. The rapporteur is proposing that EUR 32 million is needed for enlargement immediately and a further EUR 51 million for a special reserve. When we also take into consideration the 6 million euros reserved for observers and the extension of property reserve of 15 million euros it is my group’s opinion that sufficient funds have indeed been set aside for preparations for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The language issue is one of the hardest matters to deal with. Nearly every new Member State will also bring its own language to the European Union. For democracy to function properly it is vital that every EU citizen can stand as a candidate for election to the European Parliament without being required to be fluent in a foreign language. This places special demands on the European Parliament with regard to interpreting. All of us must be able to take part in the debate in our own mother tongue. On the other hand, it is virtually impossible to arrange for the smaller languages to be interpreted just through one interpreter. For example, Finnish is interpreted first into English, say, and only then into Greek. In my opinion, we should establish the practice of interpreting as many languages as possible, including the smaller ones, into the most important languages, that is to say, English, French and German. In this way Members could listen to the original speech in these languages as interpreted by just the one interpreter.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial problem is the support of Parliament’s core activities. It is incomprehensible that the committees should be short of staff to carry out preparatory work at the same time as legislation work has increased. It is important to give more support to this basic work. Parliament must be capable of high standards in its treatment of matters, as, otherwise, the Commission and the Council will become too overbearing and above all because the quality of legislation will otherwise suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the wrong way to provide finance. There is no question here of unforeseen expenditure. Parliament also wishes to prepare for enlargement by employing additional staff. To cover the cost of this the desire has been expressed to resort to the so-called negative priorities, in other words seeking to trim and wind down current activities. Savings would then apply most drastically to activities that maintain Parliament’s pluralistic and diverse nature, and that is why this is the wrong way to provide finance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reasonable for both the Commission and Parliament to place on view the administrative expenditure due to enlargement under Section V of the budget. It is reasonable to exceed the upper limit for administrative expenditure recorded in the Interinstitutional Agreement partly because when the agreement was being made there was no provision for the inclusion of ten new Member States and nine new languages. The costs of enlargement must be paid for and they must be shown transparently in the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic data for our EU as regards employment and economic growth are not particularly good, and, in addition, the fiscal burden in Europe, which is to be borne by the citizen, has reached an all-time high of 46%. Put in clear terms, this means that the Member States will have to manage without tax revenues from 2003 until 2008, as prevailing tax rates are too high and must be reduced absolutely. That is also what we in this House have committed ourselves to.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Member States' budgets will not be able to cope with any additional burdens, the payment of higher contributions being one example. The EU's citizens will not accept higher tax burdens. If we decide on them all the same, the political landscape of the EU is likely to change in the future and probably not to Europe's advantage. It is highly likely that, at the next elections, the voters will tell us what they think about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these is enlargement and the other, assistance to Members.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that in the enlargement process we will have to seek a balance between the political timetable and efficiency, without which there will be a surge in administrative costs and expenditure on buildings, an issue of great interest to Members and Parliament as a whole, because the public image of this Parliament very often suffers if too much money is spent on buildings. This is the essence of the amendment tabled by our group: to seek improved information on the part of the services corresponding to this Parliament to discover the true need for these buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, assistance to Members also requires a balance between professional requirements and the immediacy of Members activities, which are very specific and which require punctual and immediate assistance. Parliament now has more political responsibilities, new competencies and a whole set of technical requirements that need to be fulfilled, yet there have been no improvements to the administrative element of our assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we need to follow the recommendations of the ROME-PE study. We believe that the rapporteur has covered this very well in his report, and for this reason, apart from further negotiations with the Bureau, the rapporteur’s opinion should prevail in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would then like to stress the importance of item 20, which calls for the broadcasting on the Internet of audiovisual recordings of Parliament’s plenary sittings and for the creation of archives.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Gill, I believe that the principle of publicising our work is very important. There will be meetings which will have a large audience and meetings which attract less attention, but I still feel that the Internet represents a very inexpensive opportunity to retrieve the fundamental democratic principle of publicising meetings, which, as we know, are only public in theory, on paper. Indeed, we know that European citizens cannot attend these events: irrespective of whether they interest thousands or dozens of people, the fact is that the public cannot have access to them without an invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The costs might be much less than those currently sustained for the various publicity materials or for reported information; this would be live information, not reported information, which would bring the European Parliament’s activities back into line with the principle of publicising our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
