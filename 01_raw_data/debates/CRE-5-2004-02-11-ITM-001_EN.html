New provisions of the Treaty of Nice will enter into force, and enlargement will expand the territory included in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is therefore time to take stock, to assess the mandate – this first five-year period. The annual debate focuses on this area and this will also be the approach of the resolution that we are preparing for the end of March. This is the European Parliament’s first message: we want this assessment to be made – not only by us, but also by the Commission and the Council. Here we will kick things off and publish our own evaluation in due course. We know that the Commission is also preparing its assessment, which we look forward to seeing. We would strongly recommend that the Council does the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask for the forgiveness of the chairman of our Parliamentary committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, who will probably refer to this again and who had the idea and proposed it in our debate the day before yesterday. We argue that the Council should now start preparing seriously a Tampere II, a new European Summit specifically dedicated to the area of Justice and Home Affairs, in which this political assessment is undertaken in a serious and transparent way, without people harbouring reservations. We also call for a new and realistic programme to be defined for the medium term. This must be done under the Dutch Presidency, in the second half of this year or, at the latest, under Luxembourg’s Presidency in the first half of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">And we need this balance-sheet, one drawn up by all three elements of our institutional triangle, primarily so that we can then move ahead with political discernment and with new strategic direction. We need a dynamic balance-sheet; one that assesses the current situation and reaches towards the future. I would say the first requirement is for a positive assessment of many of the developments already achieved in this five-year period. We realise that the area of freedom, security and justice is an entirely new concept and a new direction for the Union’s development. It is therefore important to make a clear and positive assessment of the progress that has been made. On occasion, the understandable dissatisfaction of many is misunderstood by the general public. The wish to have gone further is frequently expressed; it is taken to suggest failure and gives rise to feelings that the situation is in crisis, which do not reflect the true picture.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that the general public is one of our greatest allies, and in order to involve it more closely in this process we also have to give this general public knowledge and trust instead of only frustration or utopian ideals. Hence, first of all, the future strategic importance that I attach to a more intense policy of providing information in this field. If we ask the Council to come up with a Tampere II, however, it is also because we feel that Tampere I, in 1999, was of great value and I therefore wish to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, because I know how much Tampere owes to his efforts. It is true that much remains to be done, but the Tampere methodology, if we can call it that, was in itself positive, a framework for this parliamentary term, because without Tampere we would now be much worse off and further behind.</p>
<p class="contents">To give a broad outline and without going into the details of the motion for a resolution that we are working on and without returning to the terms of the oral question – this will certainly be done by my fellow Members of other political hues – a general assessment could be made, ranging from ‘very positive’ as regards the progress made in cooperation in judicial and civil matters, to ‘almost total stagnation’ in the field of police cooperation, with ‘good’ and ‘bad’ or simply ‘tolerable’ in between, applied to the progress and delays in the fields of asylum and immigration and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also very powerful and growing concern about guaranteeing fundamental rights, together with stepping up police and judicial cooperation, and there are growing calls for policies for integration in the field of immigration. There is first and foremost, however, a general message that could be sent to the Council and to all governments. This is a message that can be drawn clearly from these last five years and in the debates that have taken place: unless, in the remaining areas covered by the intergovernmental method, open and effective cooperation between governments and all the national authorities involved does not progress at the pace that circumstances require, public opinion will exert direct pressure for these competences and fields to be brought gradually within the Community sphere of competence, in some cases for reasons of security, in others for reasons relating to individual freedoms. In other words, if governments use their powers not only to fine-tune, adjust, calibrate and incorporate the principle of subsidiarity, but to block and hinder the development of this area of freedom, security and justice, they will be pursuing a very ill-advised approach. By waiting for so long, they will ultimately lose everything, because there are few areas in which the citizens exert as much pressure as in this one and in which this pressure makes itself felt so markedly and so powerfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we compromise by refusing to discharge budgets because, as Romano Prodi, our President, has already said, all Union policies would suffer as a result, starting with the area of freedom, security and justice. I wish to say a final word, Mr President, on dialogue with national parliaments, a point already made in last year’s annual report by the then rapporteur, Baroness Ludford. Our experience of this five-year period suggests that we in Parliament must also speed up the working processes and I have thus proposed that in the next parliamentary term, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs should adopt a working figurehead, the benefits of which I have seen in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. We must also invite representatives of the national parliaments, of their corresponding committees, to come and participate in our work and discussions. In my view, we should do this in three situations: first, regularly once every six months, secondly, when we prepare our annual debate and thirdly, when a debate is held on a legislative matter that is either of particular strategic importance to pushing through the entire area of freedom, security and justice, or which is rooted in its decision-making process and in which it is useful, in order to uproot it, to extend the Trans-European debate. Lastly, there is a powerful proactive generic recommendation: everything that has been planned must be implemented. We would like everything that has fallen behind the timetables that have been set to be concluded by the end of 2004. We believe that, when Tampere II takes place, Tampere I should have already been fully completed. Perhaps this is not possible at the moment, but this is the direction we propose in order to remove all doubts from people’s minds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro for compiling the question on which I will base my comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I want firstly to pay tribute to the work of the Greek and Italian presidencies in advancing the Justice and Home Affairs agenda during 2003. Significant progress was made on a whole range of JHA issues, including legislative measures and operational cooperation in compliance with the Tampere European Council Conclusions and the mandate from subsequent European Councils. The measure of that progress can be seen in the fact that during that period the Council adopted nine regulations, five directives, three framework decisions, two conventions, several agreements with third countries, more than twenty decisions and more than thirty resolutions and conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the focus of the debate is on progress during 2003, you have framed your questions in the context of the significant events of this year and I will bear this in mind in my response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish presidency is very conscious of the significance of this year for the Union and also for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. The key objectives of our presidency are to make progress on the Amsterdam requirements and to take forward work on the extended Tampere programme. We will also continue to promote operational cooperation, particularly in relation to police and customs.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to asylum and immigration, I would like to mention some of last year’s achievements. In the context of asylum, the adoption of the Dublin II Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining Member State responsibility for examining an asylum application, and the directive on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, were major achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also been made on two other key asylum proposals – the procedures directive and the qualifications directive. However, despite the best efforts of the Italian and Greek presidencies, it was not possible to reach agreement on these proposals. These proposals have been moved forward under successive presidencies and it will now fall to the Irish presidency to attempt to resolve the outstanding issues, in keeping with the requirements of the Tampere and the Amsterdam Treaty. We will now make every effort to get agreement on these texts within the timescale specified by the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 also saw the adoption of the first legal instruments in the area of legal immigration – the directive on the right to family reunification and the directive on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents. The Council also intends to move forward work on the directives on the condition of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of study, vocational training and voluntary services and for the purposes of research.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of illegal immigration, the Council reached agreement on the directive on assistance in the case of transit for the purpose of removal by air and the decision on the organisation of joint flights. On an operational level, various joint projects were carried out at land, sea and air borders, including the establishment of an ad hoc Centre for Border Guard Training. The Council also adopted a programme of measures to combat illegal immigration across maritime borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthening of border controls against illegal immigration will continue to be a Council priority in 2004. The Council intends to continue work on the draft regulation establishing the European Agency for Management and Operational Cooperation at External Borders, in keeping with the conclusions on this proposal adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in November. I hope that this can be agreed during the Irish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also mention that readmission agreements were concluded by the Commission with Hong Kong and the agreement between the EU and Macao was signed. Negotiations are ongoing in relation to readmission agreements with Morocco, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere European Council made mutual recognition the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters and specified a programme of measures for this purpose. There has been steady progress in the area of judicial cooperation in civil law since then and 2003 was no exception. Key measures adopted last year include the legal aid directive and the regulation on parental responsibility. The Council also established a general approach on the proposed regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims. I hope that Council and the European Parliament can work together effectively to enable this proposal to be adopted in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions will continue within the Council framework during 2004 on the proposed Rome II regulations on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, which also comes under the codecision procedure. I also understand that the Commission intends to present a proposal for a regulation to establish a European order for payment procedure in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Your question also referred to the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. In recent years, on the basis of negotiating mandates adopted by the Council, the Community has been able to participate actively in the work of the conference where there are matters under discussion which concern its competence. In April 2003, on foot of a Council decision, Member States signed the 1996 Hague Protection of Children Convention, both on their own behalf and in the interest of the Community. The increased engagement of the Community with the Hague Conference is reflected in the fact that the Council has authorised the Commission to initiate negotiations with the Conference on the possible accession of the Community to that body.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of criminal judicial cooperation, the Council made progress last year, both on measures aimed at promoting cooperation and measures in the area of mutual recognition. Among the measures adopted were the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the framework decision on combating corruption in the private sector and the framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law. The JHA Council also agreed the Framework Decision on Drugs. A decision to sign the agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters was also agreed last year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trafficking in human beings and third countries is concerned, the Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, endorsed by the Council last May, provides the basis for a comprehensive five-year work programme. The Irish presidency will continue to support Commission initiatives to combat trafficking in human beings, bearing in mind the contents of that declaration and the work of the expert group on trafficking in human beings, which was established in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the European Arrest Warrant has been implemented by eight Member States. The remaining Member States are in the process of preparing the necessary legislation. The Accession States will have to apply the framework decision on the European arrest warrant from the date of their accession.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards procedural safeguards, I understand that the Commission will publish its legislative proposals in the course of this session.</p>
<p class="contents">On data protection in the third pillar, I would point out that various instruments already incorporate provisions to ensure the protection of personal data, for example, the Schengen Convention, the Europol Convention and the Eurojust Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also taken place in the area of police cooperation. All the Member States share the view that Europol has a leading role to play in supporting the law enforcement agencies of the European Union in the fight against international organised crime and terrorism. It is a key agency in promoting the effectiveness of, and cooperation between, the European law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority areas for Europol agreed by Council are drugs, euro counterfeiting, terrorism, trafficking in human beings – including illegal immigration – and financial crime. Moreover, the police of the Member States cooperate closely to fight serious transnational crime on a daily basis. Many operational successes have been achieved in recent years, for example, as regards drugs, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and child pornography. Europol has regularly been involved in providing support for operations in accordance with the Europol Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, the JHA Council signed a protocol amending the Europol Convention which included several provisions aimed at improving the functioning of Europol. Furthermore the Council adopted several instruments relating to the operational functioning of Europol, including the approval of a number of cooperation agreements between Europol and other states.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures adopted in the course of the year included a decision on the common use of liaison officers abroad by the law enforcement agencies of the Member States and a decision amending the Schengen Convention to allow for the carrying-out of cross-border surveillance on persons suspected of involvement in a criminal offence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chief of Police Task Force and Cepol – the European Police College – also continue to play an important role in the development of police cooperation at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the last steps to be taken before enlargement becomes a reality. The Accession Treaty, which has been ratified by all the parties concerned, provides that, in general, acts relating to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice will be applied to the new Member States from 1 May 2004. For the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, however, there is a two-step process. The acceding states will participate in Schengen-related measures on the lifting of internal border controls, including participation in the Schengen Information System, at a later stage, after 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Accession Treaty also includes a safeguard clause. That provides that appropriate measures can be taken, up to 2007, if there are serious shortcomings or any imminent risks of such shortcomings in the transposition, state of implementation, or the application of legislative measures in certain areas of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude my comments by briefly addressing your question about making European Union business accessible to its citizens. The Council acknowledges the importance of transparency in EU business. It is worth noting that the regulation on public access to EU documents, adopted in 2001, promotes transparency and provides for greater participation of EU citizens in the decision-making process. There is a high level of full access to legislative documents and partial access to other documents covering the current negotiations. At present 55% of the approximately 450 000 documents of the Council document register are directly accessible to the public on the Internet, in all the languages of the EU. The conclusions of each JHA Council meeting are available to the public, as are the texts of all adopted measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my comments have given you an overview of the achievements in the justice and home affairs area during 2003. I thank you once again for giving me this opportunity and I look forward to continued cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council in this historic year.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this annual debate is not exactly the same as all the others, because it is taking place at a historically important juncture. Ten new Member States will soon be welcomed into the Union, we are in the process of negotiating a new Constitutional Treaty, and we are approaching the end of the European Parliament’s term, as well as the end of the period set by the Treaty of Amsterdam for laying the foundations of an area of freedom, security and justice. I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro not only on the rigour and quality of his preparation for this debate, but also on the way in which he has approached it. What he has presented is not only a balance-sheet of one year’s developments but also gives a more wide-ranging view of what has been achieved in this parliamentary term. The Commission, for its part, regardless of what I say now, will contribute to this balance-sheet by means of a communication that it will present to the Council and to Parliament in June of this year, when we will present an exhaustive assessment of what has and what has not been achieved in accordance with the Tampere programme and the Amsterdam Treaty. In this assessment, we will also set out some ideas on potential bases for a Tampere II programme in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In shall attempt to respect the order in which the honourable Member raised his concerns: in the field of immigration and asylum, the Commission has always sought to weave together the four main strands of this policy, as defined in the Treaty of Amsterdam: regulating the flows of legal immigration, promoting the integration of third-country nationals into European societies, effectively combating illegal immigration and defining a common asylum policy and extending partnership with third countries in order to regulate migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards legal immigration, the Commission has submitted several proposals to create the necessary legal framework. The Council has already approved the proposal for a directive on family reunification and on the legal status of third-country citizens who are long-term residents. I hope that by the end of this parliamentary term, we will also be in a position to adopt the proposal on victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the authorities and who, therefore, have the right to a residence permit and also the proposals on allowing third-country students and researchers into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One disappointment that I would want to express concerns the problems in reaching, together with the Member States, a common platform for managing migration flows involving legal immigration, or what is known as ‘admission for work purposes’. In this field, there is deadlock in Council, the Commission proposal clearly does not have the support of the Member States and the Commission will return to this issue when we present, at some point in this six-month period, the study we were asked to draw up on the link between legal and illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of integration, the steps that have been taken following on from Thessaloniki are to be welcomed and we are now implementing preparatory projects for a broader strategy for a specific European programme to integrate immigrants into European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards illegal immigration, the Commission has presented three action plans that have been accepted by the Council and are now being implemented: the first concerns the fight against illegal immigration; the second, the common management of external borders and the third, a Community policy for the return or repatriation of illegal immigrants. I am also hopeful that the Agency for monitoring and operational coordination at external borders will soon be approved and the Commission intends to present a new legal instrument, which is the revision of a common Schengen manual on best practice for external border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, security issues have assumed considerable importance following the events of 11 September 2001. The Commission has already presented proposals on stepping up the security of some fundamental documents, such as visas and residence permits, by introducing biometric data and will, in a month’s time, present its proposal on including biometric data in the passports of EU citizens. Steady progress is also being made on developing the visa information system (VIS).</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to repatriation policy, the Commission is basically proposing, in the short term, actions on two fronts: one involving financial support, which still has to be discussed, and another on an initiative for minimum standards for repatriation procedures. As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, important legal instruments have been adopted in the field of asylum: temporary protection, minimum reception standards, the Dublin II regulation and the implementation of the Eurodac system, and the European Refugee Fund, which came to the end of its first phase having mobilised around EUR 146 million in the last four years. The Commission is working actively with the United Nations High Commissioner on new ideas for asylum policy, particularly with a view to ensuring the more ordered and organised entry of refugees into the European Union, and the possibility of applying for asylum outside EU territory and also in order to increase protection in the regions in which crises originate. There are, however, two fundamental points relating to asylum policy that are missing. I am referring to the directive on asylum procedures and to the directive on qualifying for refugee status and harmonising rules on subsidiary protection. I am pleased, because I know how committed Mr McDowell is to these two instruments being approved during the Irish Presidency, and, consequently, within the deadline set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that we can end this parliamentary term with all the instruments needed for the first phase of a European-level common asylum policy having been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also present a report in Spring 2004 on the negotiations underway on readmission agreements and we particularly welcome the fact that we have been able to reach agreement with the Council and with Parliament on a financial programme for the period 2004-2008, worth EUR 250 million, to develop a partnership with third countries for the joint management of migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">On judicial cooperation in civil matters, I fully agree with what the minister, Mr McDowell has just said. The Commission’s assessment is broadly satisfactory and, curiously enough, it is probably in the field of civil judicial cooperation, rules on contractual disputes, on extra-contractual obligations, on family relations and on regulating parental power that some of the decisions that this Parliament and this Council take have the greatest influence on the daily life of all European citizens, but the media normally pays these scant attention. It is much more newsworthy to talk about crime than about the everyday lives of normal people. It is, however, precisely in the everyday lives of normal people that most progress has been made under the Treaty of Amsterdam and under the Tampere programme and I sincerely hope that, by the end of this parliamentary term, we will be able to surmount any difficulties in approving the directive on compensating victims of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the external dimension, I wish to emphasise the fact that the Commission asked the Council for a mandate that would enable the Community to formally sign up to the Hague Conference on Private International Law, in order better to ensure that the process of including judicial cooperation in civil matters within the Community framework is consistent with what is being done under the Hague Conference conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the issue of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. I believe that the balance-sheet of this parliamentary term is a positive one. Positive in the sense that, in practical terms, the framework decisions on all types of European crime set out in the Treaty have been approved, with one exception: racism and xenophobia, which is still proving problematic for the Council. Once again, however, I wish to emphasise that the Commission has remained true to the principle that the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments, the best example of which is the European arrest and surrender warrant which, like Mr McDowell, I hope is fully established in all fifteen Member States by the end of the first quarter of this year and is in force in the candidate countries as of 1 May of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will soon present a framework decision on procedural safeguards and we are convinced that the initiative we will be taking in June this year to present a framework decision on minimum rules for data protection, under the third pillar, will be equally significant. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters and strengthening mechanisms for police and judicial cooperation in the fight against crime must, at the same time, be accompanied by rules for minimum procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings in all Member States and for the protection of privacy and personal data in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, that police cooperation involves cooperation more at the operational level than at legislative level, where I believe the Convention on the future of Europe has been proven right to emphasise that the ‘convention’ instruments in this area do not work: the amendments to the Europol Convention are still awaiting ratification by most Member States; the Convention on mutual judicial assistance, signed in May 2000, has still not been ratified by all EU Member States and, consequently, has not entered into force. Operational cooperation, however, has improved and it is crucial, if Europol is to be able to perform its duties, that Member State police forces have confidence in Europol and, above all, that information is exchanged on an ongoing basis on the forms of transnational crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I fully share your concern that it is crucial to inform the citizens about what is done. The Commission has launched awareness-raising campaigns on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on some of the legislative instruments that we have adopted and which might have a more direct impact on citizens’ lives. To be quite honest, however, I think the most reliable snapshot will be provided by the elections to the European Parliament, embodied by the Members of this Parliament – and you can pride yourselves on what you have achieved in this parliamentary term in the field of Justice and Home Affairs – since these are the best interpreters of the information that the citizens have the right to know, because they prove that European democracy works and that the issues of concern for the daily lives of the citizens are taken seriously by the bodies of the European Union, starting with their legitimate representatives, the Members of the European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, anyone who simply reads the progress report on the last year will be surprised by just how much progress we have made in the area of security, and you, Mr President-in-Office and Mr Vitorino, together with the European Parliament, can be proud of how much things have moved on as regards security. I would just like to highlight a few points that strike me as particularly important. For one thing, the Eurodac system became operational in January last year. That quite simply means that the Dublin Convention is now being effectively applied, that we can establish which country is actually responsible for dealing with an asylum application, and that we have an instrument available to us to successfully halt abuse of the asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent flows of illegal migration, we have established partnerships with countries of origin and transit countries. We have created an overall package of measures for combating illegal immigration which provides in particular for preparation for a new integrated system for securing external borders, with very high standards, to apply at all existing and future external borders of the European Union. We have also made preparations for joint repatriation campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else I regard as being particularly successful is the political commitment to including biometric data in visas and residence permits, as in that way we will be able to ensure that we give people crossing borders documents that cannot be forged. Another significant development is the conclusion of the cooperation agreement between Europol and the new Member States or other States such as Romania or Russia, as a means of taking successful action on the ground against international crime and in particular against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, another outstanding success story is the agreement reached for the first time on a standard minimum sentence to combat illegal drug trafficking, and then there are the measures we have taken in the fight against synthetic drugs, or the progress made in civil and criminal law, which I shall not go into in greater detail. All in all, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have successfully implemented an excellent package of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to make some critical observations and to make certain requests. The first thing I would like to say is this: I think it is essential that the current presidency's ambition to implement the status and procedures directive in the first part of this year, that is by April, should be achieved in the interest of a common asylum policy. I fear that if we do not manage that we will have enormous problems in actually agreeing upon a common asylum policy, as we would then be without any emergency aid for refugees. We would accordingly be left without the instruments needed to move forward in combating abuse. You have our full support in this area as President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about combating corruption. In the interests of stability in the new Member States, it is vital for us to step up the fight against corruption in those states, and we must help them to reach the Schengen standard at the new external borders as quickly as possible. That is in the interests both of the new Member States and of the European Union as a whole. It will require investment. You have our support on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about agencies. I do not think we should start constantly inventing new agencies. No, we need to keep the many we already have capable of operating properly. We cannot countenance repeatedly extending the management boards – from 15 to 25 – by adding additional experts, and then, if that does not work, setting up an executive board. Then there is talk about setting up a coordinating board as well, to ensure that the other two boards operate properly. That cannot be the way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: I would like to see an overall improvement in procedures. Otherwise, there is a danger of squandering resources. We cannot have a situation in the future in which Commission documents come to this House, and then, while Parliament is doing its work, new documents, new agreements are developed, about which Parliament is not informed, so that we carry on working on the old basis and then have to start all over again. I call on you to improve coordination here in the overall interests of procedural efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate, which comes at the end of a successful year and of a successful parliamentary term, should provide a critical assessment, and should spur us on to build on that success in the interest of the security of the EU's citizens. Rest assured that we in the European Parliament will do our utmost to support you, even when it comes to the increase in the budget that will undoubtedly be needed if we are actually to achieve the successes that we wish to see in the interests of security.</p>

Indeed, the most serious obstacle today to the development of the area of freedom, security and justice is the failure to adopt the draft Constitutional Treaty which, by making the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding in every sector of the Union’s activities and extending the Community method to include judicial, criminal and police cooperation, would have resolved many of the problems that still remain. We hope that this is nothing more than a mere delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, steps should be taken to overcome certain paradoxical contradictions which continue to hold back the implementation of the Tampere programme, above all in the field of immigration and criminal and police cooperation. In fact, the very governments, which at Tampere approved a reasonable raft of measures, subsequently often fail to adopt them when those measures are proposed by the Commission and requested by Parliament. When subsequently, perhaps as the result of some emergency or other, those measures are finally adopted, frequently they are not implemented in the countries in question: such is the case, as an example of the latter, with the arrest warrant and the decision on racism and xenophobia. It therefore needs to be constantly borne in mind that dismantling internal borders enhances freedom of movement in the internal market, but also works to the advantage of criminals if the powers to prevent and control crime continue to be delimited by national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time, therefore, to relaunch an updated political programme for the harmonious construction of a European legal area, not limited to partial responses to specific emergencies, and we await expectantly the communication promised us by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the particular case of immigration, as repeatedly demanded by this Parliament, it is essential to lay down a common policy governing the entry, residence and integration of citizens from third countries which is not restricted to stamping out clandestine immigration. The delays and inconsistencies, however, which have been most noticeable on the part of the Council and Member States, are those in relation to the promotion and protection of fundamental individual rights. Measures are being adopted which, in fact, fail to respect fundamental rights with the result that Parliament is forced to bring such measures before the Court of Justice, the most recent example being family reunification. Common standards in respect of procedural guarantees are not being adopted and, as a result, closer forms of cooperation are being denied because States distrust each other when it comes to respecting those guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of personal data protection is particularly sensitive and serious questions remain to be asked about the conduct of a large number of Member States which allowed the personal data of European citizens to be handed over to US security agencies which provide no guarantee that our citizens’ fundamental right to privacy will be respected. In that connection, it must be said that the Commission’s conduct, marked by inaction and complicity, has been deplorable. The time has certainly come to adopt more effective measures in order to protect the rights of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to say that the Commission has done its job, but the Council's record is not outstanding. Both output and method need improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking first at asylum and immigration, we still do not have all the pieces of the jigsaw in place for common policies. Europeans need to have a sense that we are truly acting together to have well-regulated but fair systems in which responsibility is shared. But where is the solidarity in the disgraceful way that, one after another, 13 Member States have signalled they will impose restrictions on free movement from new Eastern Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">States have been more zealous about toughening borders and deporting illegal immigrants and on making sure immigrants are legal and integrated. The Council passed a grudging directive on long-term immigrants and one on family reunification. However, there has been no rush to implement the 2002 anti-trafficking framework decision to catch the criminal gangs, and recently in the UK 19 Chinese immigrants tragically died. It appears they were trafficked, but there is no law in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We have major challenges in Europe in addressing prejudice and discrimination and promoting equality. The challenge to integrate the Roma looms large on our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted President Prodi is holding a seminar on anti-Semitism next week, but why has the Council failed to agree the framework decision on making racial harassment and racial attacks criminal offences?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to enhance our understanding of what integration means as opposed to assimilation. Yesterday the French National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to ban the <span class="italic">hijab</span> and other overt religious symbols. We in Britain, where policewomen can wear the <span class="italic">hijab</span>, look on this with cross-Channel bewilderment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of anti-terrorism and law enforcement, there has been much useful activity, but a lack of balance in concern for civil liberties, democratic accountability and transparency. I am delighted the European Police College will be located in England, but less impressed that the UK Government, with 12 citizens and residents in Guantanamo Bay – half the total of Europeans there – has failed to take the lead in getting a common position and joint action by the European Union to persuade the US to apply international law and uphold prisoners' rights there. The Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement that was signed with the US, over our objections, stressed the rule of law, but does not seem to have borne any fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are taking too many steps invading personal privacy – agreeing to let the US access sensitive air passenger data and to put biometric data on visas and passports – while making no efforts to get an instrument for data protection in the third pillar. This shows an extraordinarily cavalier attitude to individual rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future we will need to make more of an effort to raise the quality of our observance of justice systems through a process of mutual surveillance and peer review. That is going to involve some interesting questions about where the balance lies between European common action and intervention in national systems. But we have to reinforce our efforts, because the quality of what we are doing on freedom, security and justice is not yet adequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say 'so-called' progress, because it is primarily all about sealing off Europe from the rest of the world to an ever greater extent. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was recently very frank and clear about this policy, or rather this apology for a European policy, during his address to this House when he was awarded the Sakharov Prize. The UN Secretary-General did not greet us with polite and hackneyed words of thanks, no, he really read the riot act to Europe over its immigration policy. Let me remind you what he said. He said, and I quote, 'Migrants need Europe. But Europe also needs migrants'. And Annan added that welcoming and integrating migrants was not just a moral and legal obligation but part of the solution to Europe's economic problems. He fiercely criticised the EU's fortress Europe policy. He believed that a restrictive asylum and immigration policy drove many people into the hands of criminal gangs of people smugglers or even to their death, suffocating in trucks, or perishing in the undercarriage of aircraft, and Annan said that 'this silent human rights crisis shames our world'.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people who bear responsibility for this silent human rights crisis. It is not because of some anonymous restriction that hundreds of people die every year on the borders of the European Union. But what do we get from the Council and the Commission? Reports about common lists of safe countries of origin, about cooperation on deportation, about border protection agencies for stronger land and sea border controls, about the signing of readmission agreements, and so on. If all these proposals are given force of law, the only way to have any chance of applying for asylum in the European Union will be to jump from a plane over the EU with a parachute. At the same time, the EU and its Member States are actively responsible for giving rise to refugees from countries in the so-called Third World because of their failure to adequately combat poverty or by exporting arms to crisis regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of taking countermeasures here, however, we are now to spend millions of euros on pilot projects on deportation in Europe. As a German Member of the European Parliament, I also know that up to now any halfway progressive proposal on EU asylum and immigration policy will be blocked by my country's government in the Council of Ministers. All the special German arrangements designed to scare off and harass asylum-seekers are to be preserved. To name just one example, there is the residence obligation for refugees, which is unique in Europe. Only in Germany are refugees penalised if they leave their <span class="italic">Landkreis </span>or rural district.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as there is no change in the fundamental direction of this policy, huge numbers of immigrants and refugees will continue to die at our borders. A few crocodile tears may occasionally be shed about the tragic fate of a few individuals, but nothing will change. We must finally have the courage to tell people the unvarnished truth and say that Europe needs immigration. Without immigration, by 2050 the population of the enlarged Union will have fallen from 450 million to just 400 million. Unless there is a change of course, Germany's population alone will have fallen by a quarter. The many human rights organisations in civil society are right in rejecting the EU's fortress Europe policy. Proposals for an EU asylum and immigration policy founded on a high level of respect for human rights are on the table, but they need to be accepted before we can have a genuine debate on progress here. What we need in Europe is a right of asylum in accordance with the Geneva Convention, including recognition of gender-specific and non-State persecution as grounds for granting refugee status, together with recognition of desertion and conscientious objection to military service as grounds. We need free access to European asylum rights and procedures. We need a judicial framework permitting legal immigration into the EU. We need a European legal area for campaigns to legalise the status of people without papers, and last but not least we also need a right to freedom of movement for all people living in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we will only find an effective answer to these questions, be it in Sangatte or Algeciras, by having a genuine Community policy that respects basic rights, not by always being repressive.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of Commission proposals are currently pending in the Council. The few measures that have been taken are constantly criticised and the directive on family reunification is the subject of an action by our Parliament before the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">On this question of emigration, I would simply ask you to follow the train of thought developed before our Parliament by Kofi Annan. Not only does our old continent need these workers, but the only way we will have credibility in the world is by affirming an open, pluralist Europe that shows solidarity. Immigration is an opportunity for Europe’s future and at a time when racism and xenophobia are swooping down on us we need to say that strongly and forcefully. We are convinced that freedom of movement together with a positive policy of legal immigration will enable us to apply the brake to trafficking, especially trafficking in human beings. We will then be better placed to devote ourselves to building a citizenship in which all who live on our continent will be able to participate fully, with equal rights respected – not to mention the fact that such a voluntarist policy will also alleviate the burden on us as regards both asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not yet be possible to adopt the two asylum directives, on the status of refugees and asylum procedures, despite the December deadline that was set and has now passed. But we know it is essential that they should be adopted to round off the first phase of the Tampere programme. Having said that, those two directives must also and in particular bring an added value capable of guaranteeing asylum seekers a better level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as police and judicial cooperation is concerned, I would like to dwell on just one point, that of personal data, biometric data in particular. In a communication on the transfer of data, published by the Commission on 16 December and forwarded to the Council and the Parliament, concerning the agreement concluded between the United States and ourselves, we find a security gaffe under the cover of the fight against terrorism and crime. The agreement would in fact allow the data fields transferred to include date of birth, number of persons travelling together, credit card details, racial or ethnic origin and political, religious or philosophical beliefs. But that is a serious attack on the protection of private life. What can be done about it? When we know that such information can be used as a means of discrimination, that provision also affects our basic freedoms, especially since we do not know exactly who will have access to the data. We can only be concerned about the uses to which it will be put.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, did you know that, under pressure from the United States, in particular threats to ban flights, airlines are already transferring personal data to the US authorities without the consent of the persons concerned? Such action is contrary to European law and the Commission is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures affect both Europeans and third country nationals, as you said, Mr Vitorino. That agreement was nevertheless concluded without any prior democratic debate. It is therefore democracy and the rule of law that are threatened by the conclusion of such agreements. Should a genuinely independent European control body not be set up as a matter of urgency to prevent such data being abused? And do you not think that the Court of Justice should also be asked to rule on the legality of that agreement? We must be vigilant because security is taking precedence over respect for our rights and our freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally and to conclude, how are we going to be able to guarantee respect for our fundamental rights if we sign an agreement with a country like the United States, which is constantly showing its desire for hegemony, conducts a unilateral policy and puts itself above the law, including above international law, as in the situation of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay?</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would exercise the utmost vigilance with regard to all these treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to my colleague and friend, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, for the presentation he made here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is soon to become a political body comprising 25 Member States with a population of nearly 500 million people. It is therefore of the utmost importance that all Member States in the European Union cooperate more closely to combat the threat of international terrorism and organised crime. With common European borders in existence and with the free movement of people within the Union, we too must cooperate more closely in an effort to stop drug imports into Europe and to combat the evil of human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot defeat drug trafficking and those who engage in the heinous crime of human trafficking unless our European police forces work closely together. This challenge becomes even greater as enlargement takes place, and Europol will have to play a more pivotal role in coordinating the European Union's response to these rising crimes. No country can defeat international terrorism on its own. If Europe requires more resources to face up to this new challenge, then more resources must be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times we have seen the tragic deaths of many people who have fallen foul of the scourge of international human trafficking. It is estimated that 600 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year. That is why a comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration must remain a key priority of our Union. EU financial assistance for the return action programme must be maintained and we must all support the work of the Union. The borders agency is putting in place a coordinated approach by EU Member States to combat illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I too support the implementation of a common EU asylum policy, and we must resolve the outstanding issues concerning asylum qualifications and procedures directives. We must also support the better management of the entry of persons into the European Union who are in need of international protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention. With regard to the issue of legal migration, the new EU legislation governing the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purposes of study and vocational training within the Union must be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issues of putting in place common policies to combat illegal immigration are best addressed at European Union level. We now live in an internal market where there is free movement of persons across the territories of the EU, and we must take collective action together in an effort to deal with these issues effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to extend my congratulations to both. The Council of Ministers is being pointed out as being the main culprit for leaving a number of asylum and immigration dossiers untouched. According to the Commission, Member States must abandon their reservations before the five-year period specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam has lapsed, by which time, according to the Commission, these measures should be adopted. Although this is correct, a five-year period for measures in this area was very short indeed. Widely supported legislation established over a longer period of time is more useful than swift measures that are subsequently not implemented due to political unwillingness. The European arrest warrant is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">I was surprised at the Commission proposals with regard to the admission of immigrants to the European Union. Surely that was not one of the obligations enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam? It is a topic that requires another extensive debate. Partly as a result of incidents of this nature, I am not in favour of fully implementing the vote by qualified majority in the Council about European action in the fields of justice and home affairs. These matters should be considered on an individual basis. Finally, I noticed that the Commission wishes to increase the budget for justice and home affairs considerably so as to be able to take measures in the area of illegal immigration and organised crime. Could Commissioner Vitorino elaborate on this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is what information are we to give? We heard the President-in-Office of the Council give us some amazing statistics in relation to the transparency of the Council’s work, tens of thousands of documents. It is a pity that there is one statistic missing from those documents and that is the position of individual Member States, which is not a statistic of any note but it is an essential one in terms of the democratic process. It is not by chance that it is then stated – somewhat light-heartedly, in my opinion – that the European arrest warrant has already been approved by eight Member States. How, though? A document approved unanimously during a lunch break, without debate, not yet implemented, subsequently comes to be taken almost for granted, as if it were already part of the de facto procedures of this Institution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no reference whatsoever to <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span>, although for six months the Italian Presidency has reminded us that in the field of judicial cooperation the concept of <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span> is a pillar on which citizens can rely. Not one word! Next, as regards Europol, the Presidency affirms that the protocol is a step forward: but that protocol denies what Parliament has been requesting for years, that is to say democratic control. In addition, the French and British Members are currently opposed to such a Community position on Europol.</p>

It would indeed be hard to understand if, in the last debate evaluating the area of freedom, security and justice in this mandate, we should confine ourselves to holding what is merely an annual debate. It therefore makes perfect sense that we should take stock of the mandate and I congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro on the superb report he has presented to us, with which we broadly agree.</p>
<p class="contents">We must indeed acknowledge that even though substantial progress has been made on legislative measures, on measures for operational cooperation and on measures for institutional structures, some of the progress made has been unable to meet the deadlines set at Tampere and, what is worse, other aims that have been defined have also not been met.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight ten areas in which concrete measures must be adopted: firstly, legislation must be enacted in the field of data protection under the third pillar, providing guarantees equivalent to those set out in Directive 95/46/EC under the first pillar; secondly, a common integrated management policy for the Member States’ external borders must be created, with Community funding; thirdly, the Council must adopt the two remaining proposals for directives that are needed to be able to complete the first phase of the common European asylum system; fourthly, the Council must approve the proposals that are currently blocked and which are intended to establish a common policy in the field of immigration; my fifth point is that a tangible proposal must be submitted on developing the visa information system (VIS); sixthly, we must be presented with a proposal for a framework decision on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in EU criminal proceedings; seven: because bringing the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis </span>into the sphere of Community competence<span class="italic"> </span>has enabled greater coordination to take place between the police and judicial services of the Member States in their fight against organised crime, it is now crucial that we move ahead, as swiftly as possible, on creating the new SIS II; my eighth point is that progress on police cooperation must be promoted, by means of a legal process, as Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, that is less complex and cumbersome than the Europol Convention, involving Union-level judicial and democratic scrutiny; my ninth point is that we must continue to conclude stabilisation and association agreements with the States in the Western Balkans region in the fields of combating organised crime, the power of the judiciary, the war on drugs, border management and immigration; my tenth and last point is that there must be supervision of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>’ implementation in the enlargement countries especially as regards the field of justice and home affairs, and the implementation of the Schengen mechanism and the <span class="italic">acquis</span> covering external border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that, in its work programme, the Irish Presidency considers developing this area to be its top priority and I hope that we will be able to develop fruitful interinstitutional cooperation. I acknowledge that the task we have set ourselves is enormous and extremely ambitious, but unless the pace picks up and the Council’s decision-making ability is increased, we will reach the end of this five-year period having failed to meet the objectives set out in Tampere. I therefore hope that by the end of 2004, we will have adopted all the measures on which we are lagging behind and which are included in the objectives and timetables that have been set.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we must deplore the initiative adopted by some Member States to send a letter to the Commission to persuade it to impose a substantial reduction of the Community budget in the financial perspectives for the period 2007-2013. As President Prodi has already stated, in other essential areas, particularly in the sphere of economic and social cohesion, this would prevent the Commission from carrying out its work in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has tabled an ambitious and comprehensive draft resolution at this critical juncture. Commissioner Vitorino acknowledged as much.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse everything Mrs Paciotti has already said concerning human rights, and would like to focus on two issues in this draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall deal first with criminal judicial cooperation. My comments are addressed mainly to the Council. In my view, the arrest warrant is a most significant development. It enshrines the essence of the principle of mutual recognition and ought to have been implemented in all Member States by now. The warrant has implications for the fight against terrorism and also for the fight against criminal activity. I believe we should be much more actively engaged in follow-up measures such as the exchange of evidence. There is no way of convincing the citizens that this cannot be done in order to improve security as we Europeans would like it improved, namely by increased cooperation rather than increased repression.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I think it is important to make an effort to ensure the framework decision on court rights is adopted. This is particularly relevant within the context of the current discussions on enlargement. In my view, it is the other side of the coin of judicial and police cooperation and mutual recognition in the context of cooperation in the field of criminal judicial cooperation. No delays should be countenanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner referred to the four Tampere principles in connection with asylum and immigration policy. I firmly believe these principles are valid. I am also convinced that the Commission’s proposals go some way to setting the right course for them. Nonetheless, I have the distinct impression that a degree of confusion still prevails five years on and almost at the end of the Tampere mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The expression ‘flow management’ should refer to legal entry to work and reside in the European Union. In Council jargon, it is now used to refer to the fight against illegal immigration. The concept of management of legal flows has ceased to exist. At present, the Council is not even in a position to engage in debate on entry and residence for work purposes, though this is the crux of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The tone of discussions in Council is becoming increasingly exacerbated. If this continues, and the notion of combating continues to be associated with the words immigration and illegal, the result will inevitably be more frustration for the citizens. It is essential to demonstrate the ability to lay down consistent guidelines for the management of immigration in its broadest sense in the twenty-first century. A convincing response must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues concerning legal entry and entry routes have to be tackled. So too should the integration of those who have been living in our midst for years but are still perceived as immigrants. Further, it is essential to develop a new relationship with the third countries involved. Such a relationship should not centre on readmission to the exclusion of all else. Rather, it should consist of a broad set of measures designed to ensure that immigration has a beneficial outcome for both the countries of origin and the host countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a Liberal politician with a fundamental belief in the basic freedoms upon which our democracies are based, I also think that 2003 is the time for some basic reflections upon the initiatives that have already been implemented and, especially, that are being planned under the overall heading of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully acknowledge that the terrorist attacks of 2001 are cause for revising and upgrading our security. As I see it, the attacks of 2001 were above all attacks on the democratic values and fundamental freedoms that we cherish. It is therefore crucial that terrorism should not cause us to compromise in relation to these fundamental values. More specifically, I am thinking, for example, of third countries being permitted direct access to personal data in central reservation systems for air passengers, the introduction of armed marshals on aircraft and the introduction of biometric data into the travel documents of third-country citizens and into the passports of all EU citizens. Quite a few of these initiatives involve very extensive intrusions into the sanctity of private life, raising as yet unsolved issues in relation to current legislation on data safety and the risks of data being misused. I think, in actual fact, that it is time we now did some reflecting upon whether or not these security arrangements are out of proportion. In other words, do the initiatives comply with the basic criteria governing the fundamental freedoms that we, of course, specifically cherish in the European Union? Are the benefits of the initiatives proportionate to their cost? In this area, I am concerned that the Commission was not even in a position to inform me, as rapporteur, about the biometric data required of third-country citizens and about the precise numbers of visa applicants, falsified travel documents etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I should therefore like to put to the Commissioner concerns whether or not the initiatives now being taken with a view to stepping up security are commensurate with a concern not to intrude upon the sanctity of private life and the personal dignity of EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty’s ideological ambition, namely that of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, is, of course, all but divine. ‘And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.’</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s ideologues have, for a good many years, tried to imitate the divine creator. ‘Let there be law’, the programme goes. The results reveal, however, a regrettable difference between divine and technocratic power. The work done by the EU technocrats over a period of years, aimed at realising the ideology of freedom, security and justice, has proved to bear a striking resemblance to the Tower of Babel. The observable and demonstrable results fall into two categories: firstly, the undermining of efficient national legal systems and, secondly, the establishment of an opaque supranational legal system with attendant supranational bodies that are beyond supervision. Together, these two categories of results involve huge reductions in legal certainty and, if this development continues, the criterion of success we shall be able, in a few years’ time, to use in characterising the EU project will be the blackly humorous one found in the saying, ‘The operation was a success, but the patient died.’</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote justice, monitoring systems have been established that leave the parties involved beyond all supervision. That is something of which anyone who has tried to work with the Schengen information systems, Europol registers etc is aware. The degree of legal certainty is accurately reflected in the scope of police power and the opportunities to exercise democratic control over such power. These opportunities are being reduced day by day. Fortress Europe involves neither freedom, nor security nor justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s ideologues overlook two basic facts in the sociology of law: firstly, that viable and democratic legal systems require something other, and more, than ideological phrases, legislative agreements and technological implementation; and, secondly, that the objectives pursued should be realised through the least far-reaching means.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s comprehensive monitoring report, published in November 2003, offers an ironic warning, observing as it does that the level of corruption is still high, indeed very high, and that this may have repercussions for people’s confidence in public administration and the judicial system.

<p class="contents">You have both referred to Tampere. It seems to me that Tampere was very well balanced from the point of view of rights and duties, status and control. It is quite clear from the list of the various measures, operations and agreements you have given us today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that those measures are all concerned solely with security; that makes me extremely worried because I see some members of the Council being truly diabolical in their thinking. When I hear talk of outsourcing the examination of asylum applications, I really feel that everything has gone wrong. What really worries me is that I feel that the decisions being taken today in the Council or more appropriate formats – decisions by 5, or by 5+5, depending, at any rate on formulae that are seldom very clearly democratic – are an attack on democracy and the European project. I believe the penalty that can be expected for such an aberration would be quite clear, and Kofi Annan said it himself: tomorrow we will have a Europe that is meaner, poorer, weaker and older. I do not see that as a prospect that any of us, or any of the citizens of the European Union or third countries, can relish.</p>
<p class="contents">In asking the Court of Justice to annul the decision on family reunification, the European Parliament is sending you a clear message that the Council is exceeding the bounds of democracy and I think if I were in your shoes I would want to take heed of that very strong warning from the European Parliament. I also think that instead of interpreting as it may Council decisions of which it does not really approve, the Commission would do better to interpret them by consulting its NGO partners. It would do well, with all associations, European civil society and all parliamentarians who stand up for rights, international conventions and democracy, to really cause that outbreak to happen so that in future all decisions are taken in a spirit of parliamentary co-decision as desired in the draft Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the accession of ten new Member States in a few weeks' time, this is a worrying matter. Fortress Europe is, unfortunately, nothing but a political fantasy of the Left. In recent years, there has been much talk of common immigration and asylum policy, and of cooperation in terms of criminal justice and police, but little concrete has come out of this so far. In fact, the word ‘regress’ has been mentioned in certain areas. The guarantee of fundamental rights springs to mind. At the moment, a great deal of attention is being paid to the way in which the future Member States deal with this, with good reason, while in Belgium, the freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association is being curbed. The fight against so-called racism is being misused in order to gag Flanders' most significant opposition party and to nip in the bud any criticism of the failing integration policy. In a few weeks' time, when all other parties start their election campaigns, the <span class="italic">Vlaams Blok</span> has to contend before a court of law with a government body falling within the Prime Minister's direct remit in order to defend its right to exist. We are right to worry when in Russia a candidate for the presidency disappears. Soon, in Belgium, the so-called heart of the European Union, an entire party is at risk of disappearing, one that comprises some fifty MPs and which, according to the latest surveys, is backed by 20% of the electorate. This is all done under the auspices of a Prime Minister who aspires to become President of the Commission. You will appreciate that this kind of Europe will not enjoy the approval of the majority of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the current five-year term is drawing to a close. As provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam and at the important Tampere Summit for the adoption of measures aimed at the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, a progress review is now due. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to provide an overview of what has been achieved so far, and share with you some thoughts for the future and on how to rise to this ongoing challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I feel it is important not to convey a negative impression of progress to date. A good deal has been achieved, despite the fact that much of the progress was due solely to crises such as that of 11 September. It is disappointing too that in the specific area of asylum and immigration it has as yet proved impossible for us to come up with satisfactory solutions. The sovereignty of Member States is directly affected by all measures related to the development of the area of freedom, security and justice. There is therefore a sense in which misgivings and difficulties are understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the progress made and in order to sustain it, I propose drawing up a second Tampere programme. The Commissioner’s statement suggests this could be feasible. In addition the House appears to be favourably inclined towards the idea. As I see it, such a programme should be driven by legitimacy, efficiency and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer first to the legitimacy of actions taken. In my view, actions must be based solely on the protection and guarantee of the citizens’ rights and freedoms. Parliament therefore has a crucial role to play in this regard. I am inclined to doubt whether these principles really have been the driving force behind all the measures adopted so far. Rather the opposite appears to have been the case. We seem instead to have witnessed an exercise in the protection of the national interests of Member States. Parliament has often been sidelined. On occasion, documents the House needed to take a decision on actually arrived late.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that a long hard look at reality will show my misgivings are justified. For instance, I could point to the minor role played by Parliament in key areas such as the agreement on judicial cooperation with the United States. The programme to combat terrorism and organised crime is another relevant example. In this case, failure to consult Parliament is evidence of lack of transparency in decision-making. The only body that genuinely represents the people of Europe was sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is only fair to point out that there is one issue on which Parliament, the Commission and the Council have shown great determination and consensus. I refer to the fight against terrorism. Mr President, I should like to make a further proposal. A day should be set aside to honour the victims of terrorism. 11 September could be an appropriate date for such an international day of remembrance. This is the only way of recognising those who have suffered most from this dreadful scourge. Sadly, terrorist incidents are becoming increasingly common. They represent an attack on the most basic of all human rights, namely the right to life and physical integrity. I trust my suggestion will be taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, careful consideration should be given to the effectiveness of the measures adopted. Clearly, the current decision-making process has resulted in a somewhat schizophrenic situation. Allow me to mention a few examples. Member States launch initiatives that are never carried through and overlap with each other. Processes grind to a halt in Council because of the requirement for unanimity. This is the case for the development of regulations for the asylum process. Most serious of all are the unacceptable delays in transposing Community regulations into the legislation of Member States. The European arrest warrant is a prime example. Hence the importance of the changes contained in the draft European Constitution, aimed at avoiding such situations in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer to solidarity. At present, this is particularly conspicuous by its absence across the majority of Member States. It is abundantly clear that governments are more concerned about internal public opinion or their national budgets than about achieving European objectives. I have no doubt that this is what actually happens in Councils of Ministers when it comes to tackling the serious problems resulting from the proliferation of requests for asylum. The same is true of the problems posed by uncontrolled and sporadic economic migration. Several Member States are having to cope with the tragic consequences of these phenomena.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing about this strategy is that it takes no account of the real state of affairs. In an area of freedom, security and justice, internal borders no longer exist. There can be no point in doggedly defending strictly national positions against other Member States when the effects of policies adopted by certain countries have a direct impact on the remainder.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a common venture. The area under debate is a common venture. We are called on to move forward together. Only then will we reap the benefits together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I shall restrict my remarks to the area of legal migration, a subject touched on by both Mr McDowell and Commissioner Vitorino and picked up by several colleagues here.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with much of what Mrs Kaufmann said earlier in her reference to Kofi Annan's speech to the European Parliament a few days ago. Mr McDowell spoke earlier on about family reunification and allowing in migrants for purposes of study and training. But that is only part of the issue concerning legal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino on the other hand has tried over the last few years to push forward a more imaginative agenda with a wider framework. I believe very strongly that without a system of legal migration into the European Union – something like the green card system that the United States has in place – we will continue to face the challenge of illegal immigration with all its problems. We will continue to face the difficult problems of trafficking gangs and all the crime associated with that, to say nothing of the continuing shortage of labour in key industries, both skilled and unskilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless I have missed a key point, I do not believe there is an alternative to planned legal migration. But I am also absolutely convinced that this must be done in a manner that is positive both for EU countries and for the countries of origin. It is not acceptable just to take skilled workers from less-developed countries, nor is it acceptable for rich EU countries to say they will take migrants to do those unpleasant, dirty jobs that they do not want to do. This is why I urge the Commissioner and the Council to press on with this very difficult work in an important area – a structured programme for planned migration for a European Union of 25 countries and more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obstacles will be placed in the way of real operational cooperation between law enforcement agencies at European level. A genuine and proper system is needed to defeat criminal organisations and gangs. Italian law, which is effectively abolishing international warrants, appears to have been deliberately made for the purpose of preventing those in power being asked questions they find embarrassing, such as the questionable use of tax havens, the unlawful export of capital and involvement in convenient off-shore companies.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand, the European arrest warrant has not yet been ratified by my country. After a period of almost five years, the attempt to streamline the extradition procedures is a long way from achieving any tangible results. A closer understanding of the justice problem calls for a preliminary observation concerning the independence of the courts. In Italy, today, there is a desire to return to the legal and political culture of the Middle Ages, permanently overcome in the western world by the abolition of immunities and privileges, sanctioned in 1789 by the French States General. The separation of powers in the modern State has currently been thrown into question, first by common <span class="italic">ad personam </span>laws, then by constitutional laws which people are attempting to pass off as common laws, which means they are not subject to qualified majorities and second readings. At the heart of this is the destabilising attempt to make the courts subservient to the executive, something we witness the Italian Government doing on a daily basis by means unworthy of a civil State.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I making such serious allegations in the European Parliament? I believe that democracy cannot be exported but it is something that you can live and the more we live it together the stronger we make it. In order that my country may overcome this difficult time, all the European Institutions must keep a close watch over what is happening in Italy. What is happening may set a bad example that can so easily be exported elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We list the texts in preparation and, as usual, we regret that the Commission’s ideas are not advancing fast enough. I would like to ask the question a different way and return to reality. What has been the result on the ground of the measures already taken? Obviously, I am thinking of harmonisation in the loosest sense and the abolition of internal border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, ladies and gentlemen, the results of that abolition have been disastrous with both increased illegal immigration and increased trafficking of all kinds, from drugs to procuring. The combination of a lack of controls and illegal immigration is making even Europe a breeding ground for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino will no doubt reply that this is the proof that we need to go further with communitisation. Well, no, Commissioner, because that communitisation would disconnect the system from the peoples even more and weaken the security imperatives even further.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we look forward anxiously to 1 May 2004, which will give new powers to the Commission, relaunch the process of further downward harmonisations and continue putting in place a system that is remote from the people. </p>
<p class="contents">However, some States seem to have been showing a new lucidity recently: they are putting a brake on lax texts, on the status of refugees and subsidiary protection, for example. I congratulate them for protecting their citizens this way and encourage them to continue, because the decisions of Amsterdam and Nice in this area were irresponsible. We need to change our priorities completely, put a stop to harmonisation where it lowers our defences and give pride of place to security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a difficult assessment to make because it has many aspects: there are the political and legal aspects, and then there is the social aspect on which progress must be made. The political aspect involves the will of the Member States; the legal aspect is based on the instruments made available by the Treaty; as regards the social aspect, it has no logical basis whatsoever insofar as it is dictated by the continuous development of the framework in which the European area of freedom, security and justice is to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the time available to me, I will deal mainly with the political aspect. It is the declared intention of the majority of Member States – unfortunately not all of them – to extend and consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in response to an increasingly explicit desire on the part of European citizens to pave the way to solidarity and extend the areas of cooperation in relation to the reception of new waves of immigrants, smoothing out the inconsistencies that still exist with regard to the recognition of the right to asylum, citizenship and establishment in any EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that this attitude can be traced back to the tremendous incentive provided by the demands contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights for European citizens, which was launched in Nice in 2000 and waiting to be included in the Constitution. It is a document that can be compared to good wine: at first it did not make much impression being rather weak and imperfect but, with the passage of time, the intrinsic quality of the text increasingly emerges wherein we find precise reference points for all the choices and measures required of us in this difficult phase of our history.</p>
<p class="contents">A further step forward will be achieved by approval at second reading of the directive on the free movement of Community citizens, their rights and responsibilities, of which I am rapporteur. This provides for a raft of urgent measures that must be consolidated in order to be able to deal effectively with the new tasks imposed on us by the increasingly huge and chaotic arrival of citizens from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report in question, Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has set 18 March as the date for its approval. Almost all the political groups have accepted the rapporteur’s request not to table amendments to the text issued by the Council, in which only 50% of Parliament’s requests are included. Agreement with the Commission has also been reached on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that this directive, although not perfect, must be implemented during the current term of office, preferring to see the glass half full rather than half empty: in other words, better to have half the requests rather than to refer it back indefinitely. We hope the Council is able to appreciate this responsible position so that citizens may be given at least that part of the reforms which are contained in the text and which constitute, in any event, important steps forward to give legal substance and political dignity to the status of European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the deadline approaches, we find that the glass is both half full and half empty. Without doubt progress has been made under the difficult conditions which the different cultures and approaches of the Member States created in the Council. As far as immigration policy is concerned, significant progress was made at the European Council in Thessaloniki, as you too mentioned, Commissioner; nonetheless, the question of recognising rights and the social integration of immigrants does not appear to be very high on our political agenda. And this certainly is not in keeping with everything we maintain about a Europe of humanitarian values and respect for human rights. The directive on family reunification, as edited by the Council, is essentially prohibitive and I think it important that the European Parliament take recourse to the Court of Justice on the question of the content of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as asylum is concerned, I should like, Mr McDowell, Commissioner, to send my condolences to the Council for failing to adopt the two directives on the definition of refugees and the procedures for granting and revoking refugee status, which were also issues which the Greek Presidency advanced. In the meantime, it is a well-known fact that the Geneva Convention on refugees has been torn to shreds from one side of the European Union to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as combating international organised crime is concerned, I consider that no progress has been made in this sector, when thousands of women and children are shipped into the European Union every day for the purpose of exploiting them sexually. I think that this failure is due to the lack of essential operational cooperation between the police authorities in the Member States on combating this phenomenon which is an insult to our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, efforts by the Irish Presidency to bring to a close the matter of creating a personal database on immigrants with biometric elements, such as fingerprints and a digital photograph, will, I believe, create serious discrepancies in the matter of respect and control of the management of personal data.</p>

Statistics show that crime is on the rise in various Member States. Moreover, crime is increasingly being characterised by growing aggression, which increases the public perception of the lack of security. It is, unfortunately, no longer exceptional for innocent citizens to be killed or seriously injured during assaults. Certainly now with enlargement around the corner, anxious citizens are right to question whether the European Union can offer sufficient guarantees in order to safeguard their security. It is the very same citizens who have to stand by and watch inadequate police action being taken to tackle this increasingly insolent criminal behaviour. It is of the utmost importance that the Commission should propose measures in order to alleviate this particularly painful shortcoming. After all, it is the government's principal task to guarantee the security of their citizens under all circumstances. Since the EU’s external borders are due to be considerably extended, it is very much a question of whether the new Member States can sufficiently act as buffers against unwanted and illegal immigration. It is an ever more burning issue within the EU as a result of which integration policy, which has to be adopted, is being undermined. In fact, what are we waiting for before we implement a global action plan with the intention of removing all illegal immigrants from the EU's territory? For as long as we have no firm grip on illegal immigration, there will be no real area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we are still a long way from implementing this objective. The citizens of the Union must be able to move freely within the EU, and at the same time we have to step up the fight against crime. The biggest challenges are the prevention of crime, ensuring the security of the external borders and the full-scale implementation of Schengen. The Schengen Convention is an important step forward in the area of free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention must be paid to securing the external borders just prior to enlargement. As soon as their membership begins, the new Member States will be able to participate in the first stage of the Schengen process, which will prepare them for full Schengen membership. During the first stage there will still be internal border checks on the frontiers between the new and the old Member States. They cannot be discontinued before controls on the Union’s new external borders reach the required standard. The updating of the Schengen information system will have to be expedited so that any possible technical defects in the Union’s information systems do not prevent the new Member States from moving on to stage two.</p>
<p class="contents">There have to be increased levels of cooperation between the authorities in the EU Member States in the prevention of, and fight against, crime. Cooperation based on conventions is outdated and a slow process in today’s EU. Member States sign and ratify conventions at their own pace, if they do so at all. It can take several years for a convention to come into effect from the time it was negotiated. In the meantime shortcomings in levels of cooperation and the flow of information between authorities are an obstacle to solving and preventing crime effectively. The Union has to develop new legal instruments to meet today’s demands regarding cooperation between Member States more effectively. Cooperation between the police, customs and border control authorities has not made progress in the way hoped for. We now require initiatives and action from the Member States and the Commission to achieve better levels of coordination. The EU in its present form offers the potential for fuller cooperation. Together we can do more if there is the will among Member States to combat crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recall the proposal for a directive on granting refugee status, which should have been approved well before the end of 2003, but this is not, unfortunately, an isolated case. We must also talk about the general aim of putting the conditions in place for an ordered entry into the European Union for those who are without international protection, but the fact is that another important directive on the procedures that the Member States should implement to grant refugee status ultimately fell by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 and 28 November abandoned its quest for a political agreement on these two pieces of legislation that are crucial to the first phase of harmonising the common asylum system, and decided to postpone their adoption until the end of 2004. Fortunately, not everything has ended in inertia or deadlock. We must praise the attitude of the Commission and the commitment of Commissioner Vitorino, which were demonstrated in the proposal for a regulation establishing a programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of migration and asylum, an instrument that will enable us to address the needs felt by these countries in their efforts to ensure that migration flows are better managed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we overlook the fact that the Draft Constitution of the European Convention provides for a genuine common European asylum system and an immigration policy, which will enable us to abandon the current system of minimum rules in which Member States retain a large part of their national systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, even this crucial historical area is compromised, and so we can only conclude that 2003 was a year in which there was a keen awareness of the needs, and of providing the appropriate means, areas in which the Commission and Parliament did what was asked of them. It was, however, also a time that suffered from the hypocrisy, hesitation and deadlock that national strategy and ideological prejudice impose on the Council’s decision-making ability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further, 1 May is fast approaching. Pursuant to the provisions in the Treaty of Nice, certain parts of the Treaty are due to be amended on that date. Ten new countries will join the Union on 1 May too.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is also based on the rule of law, common to all Member States. I believe that over and above guaranteeing that the Member States abide by these principles, it is important for the European Union as a whole to act as guarantor of respect for such freedom and of compliance with the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe certainly support such an approach. They are constantly demanding more Europe. They hope Europe will be more than simply a large market. They want Europe to be safer, freer and more just.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country suffering the scourge of terrorism. In my homeland, some of the principles laid down in Article 6 are flouted. The terrorist group ETA deprives many of my fellow citizens of freedom of speech, freedom of action, and freedom to engage in politics. ETA and its followers restrict our liberty and threaten the rule of law. The scourge of terrorism can only be eliminated by working within the rule of law, in cooperation with the judicial authorities and the police.</p>
<p class="contents">In this day and age, terrorism can no longer be deemed a local problem. It is a global threat to us all, the European Union included.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the implementation of the European arrest warrant, the drafting of commonly recognised European lists of terrorist organisations and the definition of the crime of terrorism do represent major achievements. Together, they are helping to build the area of freedom, security and justice, and contributing to the fight against terrorism. This fight can only be won through determination, respect and the implementation of the rule of law and of all the mechanisms available under the law. Negotiation or ambiguity will not help to defeat terrorism. Terrorism is an attack on democracy and can only be repulsed by more democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Considerable progress has been made in the area of freedom, security and justice where the victims are concerned. In recent years this House awarded a prize to organisations defending victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s report, I should first like to congratulate its author. Congratulations are also due to the Commissioner. He has made a tremendous effort to contribute to the creation of this area of freedom, security and justice over the last few years. I should like to highlight some of the issues raised in the aforementioned report. It is incumbent on all of us to press for framework decisions to be transposed into the legal systems of Member States at the earliest opportunity. As stated in the report, it is unacceptable for differences in the implementation of legal provision in the Member States to result in unequal treatment for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol and police cooperation in Europe are another important tool in the fight against terrorism. Greater cooperation is called for in this regard too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure it will not be long before the new Constitutional Treaty becomes a reality. I should like to conclude by saying it is important to use the Constitution as a basis for further development of this area of freedom, security and justice. As stated in the report, the pillar structure should be done away with. It is also necessary to increase the number of decisions taken by a qualified majority. In addition, the Commission’s right to take the initiative and the role of the national parliaments must be strengthened, whilst providing for the involvement of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Unquestionably, the European Union has to guarantee freedom for all its citizens. The fight against terrorism will certainly guarantee that the Union becomes ever more just and free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that we are discussing that today, and that we will soon be reaching the end of this parliamentary term, it is fair to say that we have achieved a great deal working together with you. Not only have we made demands on you as a Commissioner, you have also made demands of us as a Parliament at times. For that reason we can say that we have all achieved a great deal together under the existing arrangements, bearing in mind how difficult it is under those arrangements to really achieve something when you have 15 Member States with 15 different viewpoints.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, many problems. We have still not really been able to combat people-smuggling. We have not succeeded in stopping the Mafia-like gangs operating in this area, and that is why many victims are still dying. We certainly need to improve police cooperation still further. We need improved international measures in order to be able to deal with this problem more effectively in the countries of origin. But of course we also ultimately need a common immigration policy so that there are no loopholes that criminal gangs of people-smugglers can exploit.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore 11 September 2001. Terrorism really is an enormous headache for us. In this area in particular we need to consider how we can take more effective action in future using Europol and Eurojust, and to consider what organisational measures need to be taken here as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, forget that in all these areas data protection and civil rights achievements should not be overlooked. On that note, Commissioner, I would like to express my real gratitude for all you have done up to now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to pick up on a couple of small points, given that this is the end of the debate and many of the points I wished to raise have already been dealt with. Referring to Mr Evans' reference to legal migration, which I totally agree with, I am very proud and happy that Ireland is one of only two countries in Europe not to have raised barriers to the movement of workers from some of the new applicant states coming to work in our country, as many of them are already doing.</p>
<p class="contents">While listening to the Commissioner and to the Minister listing the legislation that has been brought in, particularly in the area of immigration and asylum, I know both men have warm hearts, but in the description of all the legislation that was coming through, the quality of mercy seemed to be lacking in some way. The contribution that the visitors who have come to live amongst us have made to life in many of our countries must be recognised and celebrated. Indeed, Minister, when I think of this I think of my hairdresser, in your own constituency. The quality of service and gaiety and everything else in our little hairdresser's, where we middle-aged ladies go to have our hair done, is considerably enhanced by the young Chinese students who are working there; we all queue up to have them wash our hair. While that might seem trivial in the context of the many serious issues here today, it is something we must celebrate. It is not all a negative criminal issue; it is also a considerable contribution to the quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention was made, particularly by the Commissioner, to some of the civil judicial areas that have come through in the last year, many of which contribute considerably to the quality of life of our citizens. My own area of particular interest is the protection of children, as well as the question under the Brussels II Convention of access to and custody of children in parental disputes. I know it is not done in this House very often, but I cannot but refer to the difficulties I am having with the Federal Republic of Germany in many cases, particularly relating to fathers having access to their children, who have either gone legally or illegally back to live in Germany. We have situations where, for example, it appears to be perfectly easy and legal for a custodial parent in Germany to change the name of the children – the children very often bearing the father's name – without any reference to the father. Names are being changed legally, which causes considerable distress to the fathers, who in many cases are also denied access to their children, both legally and through the social services. Unfortunately, despite great efforts by myself and many others, these fathers are finding it extremely difficult to gain access to their children. While the Commissioner thinks that this kind of legislation is not often covered by the press, I have to say that this particular issue is indeed covered by the press; it is something that people genuinely care about and there is an element of justice that has to be recognised in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, finally, could you please look into your heart and see if you could not do anything to improve our relationships with the non-Hague Convention countries, to which many children are still being abducted? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the Seville European Council it was stated clearly that the Union needed to make a determined effort to combat illegal immigration. An integrated and balanced approach was advocated. The aim was to combat this new form of exploitation of human beings, which affects women and children in particular. Day after day, these individuals appear at the Union’s borders. They arrive all along the southeastern flank, right down to the southernmost tip of Europe. Following the Seville Council, Parliament and the Commission have worked hard to structure and develop what should become a common policy on immigration and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">For some time now, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been emphasising the need for greater cohesion of our aid policies with the countries where these migratory flows originate and within the framework of the Union’s external activity. This would facilitate the development of more effective ways of managing such flows. It certainly is important to strengthen more efficient border policies. Much more is needed, however, if the desired objectives are to be attained. It is essential to develop a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation with immigrants’ countries of origin. Only then can the underlying reasons for the migratory flows be dealt with. Only then will it be possible to increase and improve ways of combating poverty, which is, of course, the real reason for immigration from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must aim to integrate joint management of migratory flows effectively into its relations with third countries. To that end, aid agreements must include a commitment by all parties to discharge their respective responsibilities in the fight against the gangs. On both sides of the borders, it is the gangs who profit most from exploiting human beings in this way. Their activities amount to nothing less than a new and sophisticated form of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">All action taken by the Union should also help to stimulate wealth creation. The latter is a crucial factor in the promotion of codevelopment. Illegal trafficking in immigrants is a new kind of slavery. It provides ample opportunity for exploitation in the workplace. It is also a breeding ground for corruption and an entry route for individuals who could pose a threat to security. Readmission agreements should become a new feature of the Union’s relationships with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that in the course of this last year, the size of the very substantial financial flows generated by immigrants’ remittances to their home countries has been much in the limelight. Handling charges for such remittances are outrageous. In some cases, they amount to outright usury. I am aware that this is outside your competence, Commissioner, but I feel bound to say that the Commission ought to be able to put in place appropriate legal instruments to ensure easy and secure transfer of the fruits of immigrants’ labours. These funds could be used to promote codevelopment initiatives in third countries. They could also be used to support initiatives designed to strengthen civil society and the private sector in those countries. All this would be very much in line with the conclusions of the Monterrey Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">A few steps in the right direction have indeed been taken during the past year, and I should like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his valuable input. Sadly, however, there is still a long way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not agree with every opinion, but I have listened intently to the debate and am conscious of the fact that if I were to mention all the contributors, the short time available to me for reply would be completely exhausted – that is before I even address the very important issues that many of them raised and the very important themes which recurred in the contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in relation to the issue at the heart of a number of contributions – whether we are looking backwards or forwards – it is the Irish presidency's humble task to accomplish the outstanding agenda items as far as it can. It will be for Commissioner Vitorino to come to the June Council with his retrospective look at what has been achieved in the time period contemplated by the Amsterdam Treaty and to set the scene, if he will, for a Tampere II agenda, the starting process for which will be developed under the Netherlands presidency. For Ireland and its presidency, on the contrary, it is a matter of addressing the issues that are still outstanding on the agenda and concentrating its efforts in relation to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made of the slow progress in relation to the two major Amsterdam imperatives: the directives in relation to asylum. It will be a very considerable task to secure the agreement necessary to bring those two measures forward to completion. In relation to one of them – the Asylum Procedures Directive – I have to say that even if I have political agreement on that issue before 1 May, my successor will have to come back to the newly elected European Parliament to achieve the necessary codecision. Therefore, I do not want to create any unrealistic expectations as to what can be achieved. However, in relation to all these measures, a lot of time has elapsed, and I agree with a number of Members who express a sense of frustration that the deadlines set at Amsterdam and Tampere have not been adhered to at political level. There is a saying in the English language: 'you can bring a horse to water but you cannot make it drink'. This is one of the problems. You have to decide whether the political will is there. Are people willing to carry out the mandates that, in a burst of enthusiasm, they may adopt at a Council meeting? Are they willing to do the basic political work to achieve the implementation of the agendas they have set themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">A second point about the area of freedom, security and justice is this: it is not a repressive but an uplifting agenda. I want to echo a number of contributions here that remind us that the fight against crime, for instance, is a positive struggle to enhance and vindicate the rights of people who would otherwise be victims of crime. Thus, it is not a matter of ministers of the interior or ministers for justice at JHA level combining to think up new repressive measures, but the obverse side of the coin, which is about the rights of individuals and the right to fully enjoy an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I echo what Mr Collins, Mr Beysen and others have said about the importance of practical cooperation. Terrorists are not afraid of a framework decision. Terrorists are not even afraid of some of the outworkings of decisions on terrorism, such as enhanced penalties for those who are convicted. The main thing the European Union can do in relation to terrorism is not at paper level, but in the area of pragmatic, concrete cooperation on a day-to-day basis between the various agencies in the Member States and the European agencies, to make sure that the scourge of terrorism does not destroy the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building.</p>
<p class="contents">So we can never simply consider these matters on a legislative or paper policy basis. We have to look at them on a pragmatic, concrete, cooperative basis as well. That also has to be said in relation to Europol. What is needed is to make that agency function, not to consider endlessly to whom it should be accountable, so that it is the engine of cooperation among the Member States in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes there is a danger that we engage in the politics of the Book of Genesis: let there be light – and there is light. In my view that approach is appropriate in some areas where it is important to create a political agenda and to create a legal framework for certain areas of progress; but we should also be very conscious that we cannot simply legislate for security, freedom and justice. We must act to achieve these outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Banotti mentioned practical issues to do with civil law and its application to victims of illegal trafficking for sexual purposes, and also family law areas. I believe that very substantial progress has been made in these areas so far, but there is a lot more to be done, particularly in relation to the protection of ordinary people's rights: the right not to be exploited sexually or, for instance, the right to have access to one's children. In all of those areas we have to ensure that the emerging new European Union is an area which upholds those rights, rather than an area which creates new opportunities for people to avoid those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hernández Mollar referred to the issue of terrorism and the commemoration of the victims of terrorism. His is a view with which I personally very much sympathise. Sometimes we see terrorism purely as a newspaper story, but we must concentrate on upholding the rights of victims and acknowledging the terrible damage that terrorism does.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to deal with the migration issue. It is fashionable to say that the Justice and Home Affairs Council concentrates on combating illegal immigration and that there is not sufficient emphasis on legal migration and its implications, such as integration and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to echo the sentiments expressed by Mrs Banotti, which I believe are shared by many people here, that migration – inward migration into the European Union – is not merely inevitable, but desirable. Europe needs to be enriched culturally, economically and socially by the possibilities of migration. Migration should not be regarded as negative, something to be controlled or discouraged. Migration is undoubtedly a phenomenon of the globalised world in which we live. Societies that can deal with migration positively and without fear are societies that are, as a consequence, much richer and more just internally.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two outstanding opinions which, for the purposes of getting through our presidency agenda, we look forward to receiving from Parliament. I mentioned this in committee last month. I should like to emphasise again that I would ask Parliament for its cooperation in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the whole issue of the IGC, it is the role of the Irish presidency to attempt to consult, reflect and report to the March Council meeting on possible progress on the IGC. I believe that whether such progress is made quickly or slowly, it is a very important task for the Irish presidency to make as much progress as possible in bringing together the Member States behind the drive to implement a new constitutional treaty for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to one aspect of that treaty, many Members have spoken about the need for transparency. There has been an undercurrent of concern in this morning's debate about the lack of transparency and a sense of the lack of consultation with and exclusion of Parliament in the Justice and Home Affairs area. I have already mentioned the level of consultation that exists at the moment. One of the difficulties of getting 15 – shortly to be 25 – Member States to agree on proposals lies in the need to have some elbow room, to negotiate with them and for them to express their positions on paper. I ask Parliament to at least understand that all the working papers – some of which reflect the shifting positions of Member States – could, on the one hand, be thrown open to public scrutiny; but on the other hand, the character of those papers would probably be altered if they were to be the subject of constant scrutiny. The flexibility and the willingness of Member States to make concessions, once they had established a position on paper, could be significantly impaired if every single action in the deliberative process was to be thrown open to the widest possible scrutiny. So I ask Members of this House to understand that there is a balance to be struck between accountability and efficiency in a deliberative process involving 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank each and every Member for the very constructive and stimulating debate. I know that both the presidency and the Commission intend to take on board all of the contributions that have been made here. I thank Parliament for its courtesy in hearing me today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I gather from his response that he is also in favour of this suggestion, to which the Commissioner immediately agreed. I agree with the presidency that the Irish Presidency’s priority until the end of this parliamentary term is to resolve as many outstanding issues as possible. I endorse and support this clear priority, but it would also be valuable if the presidency and the Council could give a clear signal to the next presidency, namely the Luxembourg Presidency, that Tampere II is in a position to go ahead. I should therefore be interested to know, as far as possible, what Mr McDowell’s exact thoughts are on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we discuss asylum and migration on behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that all our proposals were totally in line with the goals decided upon by the heads of state and government in Tampere. It is extremely unfair and pure demagogy to say that the approach of the Commission to this policy area is lax. It is not at all. All the instruments on the table try to strike the right balance between proactive and positive actions towards migrants and asylum-seekers on the one hand, and on the other hand, guaranteeing the security of the borders and adequate management of migratory flows. The Commission has tried to achieve this balance through a very broad set of proposals. I recognise before the House that in some cases the degree of the Commission's ambition has not been matched by the Council. This is, as you all know much better than I, the normal way of building Europe: a step-by-step approach and an incremental approach. If you compare the legally-binding<span class="italic"> acquis</span> – and that is a very appropriate word – in this area today with the <span class="italic">acquis</span> of five years ago, you have to recognise that there has been enormous progress and we should not be self-defeating. We should be proactive and voluntarist and try to mobilise citizens to do even more and better in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of civil liberties, there is permanent tension between the guarantee of fundamental rights and the guarantee of security. It is not a given; it is something that you need to find in each decision taken every day. I believe, to be frank, that when we integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the new constitutional treaty, when we discuss procedural guarantees, when we include some procedural guarantees in the framework decisions on approximation of criminal sanctions, we are trying to find the right balance between freedom and security. Mr Santini reminded us that one of the greatest achievements of this legislature – I hope it will be possible to conclude the process before the end of the term of this Parliament – is the new legislation on the freedom of movement of our own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind you of the fact that when we talk about reinforcing our external border security and guaranteeing our internal security, we do it, not in a repressive way, but in the name of freedom. It is to preserve the freedom of movement and the abolition of our internal borders that we need to reinforce the security of our external borders. It is in the name of freedom that we say we should be more efficient in integrating legal migrants. For that purpose, we need to guarantee to our own public that we have the situation under control.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot give you a different speech, because this is the one I have been making since the very beginning. May I invite you to re-read the Commission's communication of November 2000 about immigration policy and compare it with the speech that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan made two weeks ago before Parliament. I am sorry if this looks a little presumptuous on my part, but please make the comparison and then we will talk about it.</p>
<p class="contents">My third remark is about data protection. To be frank with you, when we talk about introducing biometrics in some travel documents, we need to be very careful in guaranteeing that we are proportionate in the kind of data that we choose, in the types of data storage systems and in the types of control and supervision carried out by the necessary authorities. My argument is to draw your attention to the fact that today data protection in the third pillar is under the full authority and responsibility of Member States. We are trying to create a level playing field at European level to guarantee that in all 25 Member States there will be the same pattern of protection of personal data when it comes to law enforcement. For this purpose, the existing directives based on the first pillar are not sufficient. I hope that I will have the possibility to introduce these proposals by June this year and to present them to you.</p>
<p class="contents">My last remark is about the budget. I thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mr Coelho for drawing attention to the fact that in order to fulfil our ambitious goals, we need to have the necessary financial tools. As you will see in the proposals that the Commission presented yesterday for the new financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the area of freedom, security and justice has been given the adequate financial tools to address our ambitious goals.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Tampere II I endorse what Mr McDowell has just said. I hope that during the Netherlands' presidency it will be possible to have a Tampere II European Council. What will be the suggestions for that Tampere II? I shall highlight three main issues: first, being fair in assessing the shortcomings and the unfinished business of Tampere I – there will be the heritage from Tampere I that should be taken on board in Tampere II; second, clear objectives are set out in the constitutional treaty – Tampere II should closely follow the agenda that was defined in that treaty; and last but not least, Tampere II should focus more adequately on the quality of the transposition of European legislation in this area at national level, and on monitoring concrete implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the 25 Member States. I look forward to the debate on this subject that has been suggested by Mr Hernández Mollar, and the Commission will come forward with its own ideas in a new communication in June 2004. </p>
