<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bardong </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive we are debating today and on which we shall be voting relates to mutual assistance between Member States in the recovery of tax debts. There is certainly a great deal of scope for such assistance. Member States can even enforce judgments in these matters. The proper functioning of the single market depends in part on the effectiveness of this mutual support. That, sadly, is far from being the case at the present time. Nevertheless, since 1993, the annual number of recovery requests has averaged about 1 000, the total sum claimed amounting to ECU 50 million. This enforced payment of tax debts always becomes particularly difficult for both parties when the debtors have deposited all or part of their assets in another Member State to protect them from seizure. The result is that only 3 % to 5 % of such debts are actually recovered.</p>
<p class="contents">Directives which were adopted back in 1976 and 1977 contained provisions designed to deal with this problem, not only for agricultural levies but also for customs duties, and subsequently for VAT and excise duty too. In 1990 the Commission made an additional proposal, but it was voted down. It is now proposing new amendments to improve and modernise this procedure, because some aspects of it are no longer in tune with present‐day requirements. The crux of the matter, to which I shall restrict my remarks, consists of three points. Firstly, taxes on income and property are brought into the scope of the directive. This may come as a surprise to many people, because it is not even mentioned in the title. In Article 2 of the amended directive, however, it is explicitly stated. We welcome that, and surely cannot do otherwise, but I wonder why the Commission did not deal with this more clearly and why this aspect of the directive is not really apparent from the title.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when one state asks another to recover tax debts for it, the requested state must take the same trouble that it takes to collect its own taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, executory titles transmitted by a requesting state are to become directly enforceable in the requested state. This means that there should be no more of the delays that have hitherto resulted from the need for official recognition of the titles, sometimes entailing an additional authorisation process. Executory titles will therefore be directly enforceable, even in the other state in which the debtor is being pursued, and no requested state may insist on implementing its own validation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Commission proposal is right in principle and is necessary if the single market is to function properly. In our view, however, it does not go far enough in some points to provide the basis for really decisive improvements. For that reason, the Committee on Budgetary Control is proposing a number of further amendments. First of all, to combat fraud and tax evasion more effectively, we need to guarantee the assistance of the other Member States for a longer period of time. Instead of a three‐year lifetime for claims, the committee proposes five years. If the period is made any shorter – and there could certainly be reasons for so doing – the notice or decision that the attempted recovery has failed will be delivered more rapidly, but fewer cases pending does not mean a higher success rate.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Member States must accord the same priority to claims from another Member State as they accord to their own claims. Community claims, indeed, may even take priority over national claims. These statements have only been included in the recitals. We hope that they will ultimately be included in the operative section too, but for the time being we are happy to see them in the recitals.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Member States are absolutely free to decide whether and how the costs are to be shared in cases where recovery causes particular problems or is especially costly, for example when it is a matter of trying to combat organised crime. Irrespective of the proposals before us, I believe that the Commission still has much to do. For example, the training of tax officers in the Member States under the Fiscalis programme needs to be improved. Efforts are also needed to assimilate or at least harmonise the different recovery powers of the various Member States. At all events, this is another area where solidarity and mutual trust are indispensable. These qualities are essential to the projects in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say in conclusion that the financial interests of the Community and the Member States, as is often the case, would be well served by the plans presented here. Not only the Community, but also – and to a greater extent – the Member States will benefit from an efficient recovery procedure. Some of the calls for amendments which the Commission has now answered have come from the Member States. They ought therefore to ensure that the Council makes the right decision. As for the Commission, however, if you think about the length of time that elapsed before it tabled a proposal, the Commission does appear to have been rather dilatory.</p>

I hope I am not pressurising you unduly on this Friday morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the directive on which we have to take a decision today could hardly sound more technical, but for all that, I believe Mr Bardong's report manages to pack a powerful political punch. We know that any freedom can be abused. This is also true of the freedoms which the common internal market offers the people of the European Union – freedom to travel without frontier checks, freedom to settle in another Member State. Welcome though these freedoms may be, they have also occasionally been abused for purposes such as tax evasion. The instruments we have today to protect ourselves against such abuses are not effective enough. Since 1976, there has been a directive which provides for mutual assistance between Member States, but the main purpose of the directive was originally to collect customs duties or levies in the framework of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, with the spiralling volume of intra‐Community exchanges, this provision is no longer sufficient. That is why the Commission has put forward these proposals on which we have to decide – for example, the proposal that Member States should be able to collect each other's fines and fixed penalties in response to a request for administrative assistance. We in the Socialist Group support this proposal as well as the other proposals, because they target all forms of tax evasion and fraud. The Commission is also proposing procedural improvements, for example that administrative assistance should be requestable in future even before all domestic means of recovery have been exhausted. This is designed to prevent crafty lawyers from stalling for time and to eliminate abuse of the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rapporteur's amendments are concerned, he has our full support for all of them. I shall mention three points, some aspects of which have already been addressed by Mr Bardong. Firstly, the statute of limitation proposed by the Commission is too short and should be extended from three to five years. This view is substantiated by practical experience in past years. Secondly, when a case of enforced recovery relates to both Community claims and claims in favour of a national budget, the Community claims should be accorded priority. Thirdly, liability for the costs arising from administrative assistance should be determined by common consent between the Member States. The precise division of costs is something that a directive does not have to dictate to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up: despite the technical nature of your report, Mr Bardong, it is a very important document that will help to secure the long‐term functioning of the common market in the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, beyond the technical complexity of the subject – after all even the title is quite a mouthful – I think this report should be hailed as a further contribution towards achieving the objective so dear to many European citizens, namely transparency. Transparency in public administration means rectitude in Community systems for distributing resources and fighting fraud, both public and private.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur reminds us that there has been a strategy for mutual assistance in recovering claims since 1976, but because of anomalies in implementation, recovery cannot be fully guaranteed for either legitimate creditors or the Community and its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur – whom I compliment on the work he has done – mentioned an average recovery figure of 3‐5 %, which verges on the ridiculous. This figure is bound to worry people who are talking, with increasing conviction, of common fiscal systems, Community contributions policy, and intra‐Community VAT and excise regimes. Indeed, the introduction of the two latter regimes in 1993 has led to a considerable rise in claims to be recovered, and many Member States are already demanding their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States themselves are calling for so‐called direct taxation, mutual control of potential evaders and the fight against tax havens, which are easily established today not only inside the cumbersome banking systems of third countries, but also inside those of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a bold step from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund to tax havens, a strange departure by this report, but it serves to demonstrate that large systems, including fraudulent ones, start small, at individual level, and then become widespread. That is why the strategy for demolishing them must be based on the general interest, but must also be able to reach right down to the very roots of fraud in order to eradicate it.</p>

The subject is a difficult one, as it is a delicate area. I wish to thank Mr Bardong for what is a well prepared and expertly explained report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is becoming ever more important. With the establishment of the single market it will be much easier for those with tax liabilities to move their assets and income from one country to another. There is a danger that tax havens will start forming within the European Union. This would mean conditions that were all too ideal, especially for organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union"s problem is that it has its own budget but does not have the proper machinery to implement it. Member States are taking practical steps to improve the situation regarding both the payment of levies and the recovery of claims. However, the Member States are independent economic units which are primarily concerned with their own affairs in respect of revenues, and the recovery of other revenues takes second place. Thus only 3 to 5 % of requests for recovery in the EU have been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that the act of recovery itself, the recovery of claims, the seizure of property and other matters connected with the process, fall under the second pillar of the Union. The matters that fall under this pillar are not a proper part of the EU decision‐making process, but they do call for cooperation among Member States. Member States are very sensitive to the threat of violation of sovereignty in this area. For that reason, the recovery of claims, and the degree of cooperation which that demands, are politically sensitive questions. Despite everything, it is clear that the recovery of claims in respect of taxes and overpayments must be successful in the EU context too. For this reason, Mr Bardong"s report and the Commission"s proposal are to be strongly supported.</p>

A large part of the problem could well be that the Commission does not want to admit what is really at stake. The question of how much power the EU should exercise in this area has been the subject of much debate, not least in our Member States. Perhaps that is why the Commission is beating about the bush in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have commented on Amendment No 5. The Commission proposes that Articles 4, 5 and 6 should apply only to claims not more than three years old. I believe that it is right for us to be calling for five years, since these matters take a great deal of time to process. If the articles in question are to have any impact at all, the Member States must have more than three years to complete their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 causes some difficulties for me personally. I am not sure that we should be saying that national claims are secondary in importance to claims payable to the Community budget. This strikes me as unfair. My feeling is that national and Community claims should be treated equally; it would be wrong to give precedence to one set over the other. As I said, however, this is my personal view. The Green Group will be supporting the report, together with the amendments from Mr Bardong and the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>

The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control are good too. We shall vote in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us here are aware that some shameless debtors may organise their insolvency in such a way that the creditor Member State is obliged to apply to another Member State to whose territory the recalcitrant taxpayer has transferred – or where he holds – assets that are available for enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to put a very specific question to Commissioner Bangemann. One scenario envisaged by the Commission as part of Agenda 2000 is that Member States should cofinance the CAP. In that case, who in the event of fraud will be responsible for recovering sums disbursed in error out of the portion cofinanced by the Member State? How would one recover a sum paid in error to a fraudster who had transferred assets to another Member State or who had assets in another Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">Before proposing a scenario, we need to consider the legal procedures that are essential for it to come about, because in this case, where operations are cofinanced, it is the European institutions which decide on the amount of agricultural aid and thus the amount payable by the Member State in question. The separation between the party deciding and the party paying will pose real legal problems when it comes to debt recovery, and these may hamper the implementation of cofinancing as envisaged by the Commission – one more obstacle along a road which appears decidedly rocky.</p>

The report, which has been criticised in some points, such as the inconsistency between its title and its content, shows quite precisely the real sort of jungle in which we find ourselves. I should like to say a few words on that. There have been repeated references in this discussion to tax havens or, as we call them in German, 'tax oases'. Let us consider what that expression means. Where do we find oases? In the desert, of course. This means that when we speak of tax oases, we have to admit that everything in this landscape that is not an oasis is a desert.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the very nub of this entire discussion. Our difficulties derive from the build‐up of bureaucracies and technocratic measures; above all, they are indicative of the way in which our whole tax system is becoming increasingly complex and incomprehensible. In that respect the report is truly excellent, and I shall vote for it, because it is technically correct and shows us precisely where the problem lies, namely in the fact that in the individual states, but also to some extent in the Union as a whole, the situation is becoming ever more complex for our citizens, which naturally gives crooks the opportunity to exploit that complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see us addressing that problem very seriously, because if we do not establish a clear picture here, if we cannot adopt and implement simple solutions, we shall continue to have the same problems.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – I should perhaps point out again that using mobile phones in the Chamber is not allowed. Please switch them off!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Madam President, let me begin by dealing with the question whether the title fully reflects the content. Our own communication containing the proposed directive uses the following wording for the title: ‘mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and of agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value‐added tax and certain excise duties'. That covers the entire content. For reasons unknown to me, the rapporteur has shortened this somewhat in his own title. At any rate, in the light of this debate we shall reformulate the title to make it a more accurate reflection of the content, which should eliminate that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issues that have been raised, I should like to point out that we based our proposal on Article 100a of the EC Treaty, because it was in the forefront of our deliberations that the single market, as was rightly stated during the discussion – by Mr Bösch, I think – that the single market creates freedoms which are also open to certain abuses. We wanted to close any windows of opportunity for abuse of the system. For that reason, even though some of the proposals cover other subjects too, we believe that the competitiveness and fiscal neutrality of the market must be preserved at all events. That is why we based the proposal on Article 100a, and that is why we cannot accept some of the amendments. I shall return to that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, whose proposal is essentially in line with our own. We can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 6. I am sorry to say that reservations of a legal nature make us unable to subscribe to the rapporteur's views as expressed in the other amendments. We shall, of course, be able to debate these legal reservations with the Member States too in the course of the legislative process, but in Amendments Nos 2 and 7, which specify that priority is to be accorded to Community claims in the event of competing claims payable to the Community budget and national claims, this legal problem is plain for all to see. If the proposal is based on Article 100a, as I have said it is, the question arises as to whether these amendments are consistent with the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 7a of the EC Treaty. This is such a serious legal reservation in our view that we do not feel able to accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 4, 8 and 9, according to which the arrangement whereby the requested state is to be recompensed by receiving a percentage of the amount recovered would be replaced by reimbursement of the actual cost incurred, reimbursement would only be paid in cases where recovery poses specific problems. From that point of view, the logic of the amendments is undoubtedly clear, but they must be seen in the context of Amendment No 9, to which we cannot subscribe, since the Commission – again in deference to the fundamental principles of the single market – is proposing that the Member States waive any right to reimbursement of recovery costs from the year 2005, whereas Amendment No 9 proposes only an optional waiver without a binding time‐limit.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 5, which also featured in the debate and which relates to the extension of the period of administrative assistance from three to five years in each case, let me say that this is not a question of statutory limitation, which is not affected here. The specific purpose of the three‐year period is to accelerate the recovery procedure wherever possible. That is why we believe we must insist on the period proposed in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">And so to the question of cofinancing. I see that the Member who referred to that problem is no longer here …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests) </span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) Ah, I couldn"t see you for the Member in front.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) That, of course, is a hypothetical question, Mr Souchet, as you too are aware, because cofinancing is only one of the options under discussion. As things stand at the moment, it will presumably not be implemented at all. To that extent, the question is hypothetical. Even if a system of cofinancing were to be devised and agreed upon, the answer to your question would naturally depend not only on whose budget the funds were to come from, but also on whose shoulders the responsibility for administering the funds would rest.</span></p>
<p class="contents">It might well be that budgetary responsibility alone would lie with the Member State, which would then have to pay a certain percentage to the Union, while the Union would take care of the rest. In such an eventuality, it would also make sense, of course, for the Union to have the recovery powers. If the converse applied, it would be equally logical that the Member States should have the power to recover claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Since none of that has been decided and probably never will be, because cofinancing is becoming an increasingly remote possibility, I believe that it is pointless to speculate on this.</p>

<p class="contents">Well, Mrs Lulling, the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal. Claims for value‐added tax can certainly be subject to the recovery procedure. It is indeed possible, and the proposal refers explicitly to that possibility. At the present time, of course, we cannot include a reference to a withholding tax on interest and dividends, because it does not exist. Should such a tax be introduced, a separate provision on its recovery would have to be inserted, because that type of tax is not covered by the proposed legislation. Since there is no withholding tax on interest and dividends, there are no provisions for its recovery. Should it be introduced – against your ardent wishes, which are naturally inspired by your concern for the future of Europe and for justice and are totally unconnected to the situation in your own Member State – the directive would have to be supplemented so that any outstanding amounts of withholding tax could be recovered.</p>
