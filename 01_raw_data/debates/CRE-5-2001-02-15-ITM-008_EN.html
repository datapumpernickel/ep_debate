Yet, I doubt that this introduction will be enough to make Parliament realise that there is a crisis in China, that this typical Communist regime is, most tragically, turning into a National Communist regime and that this presents a risk now, and in the future, to security in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the people of China, Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China have no freedom of religion or conscience. In particular, the Falun Gong movement and other groups have been subjected to repression on a par with that seen during the Cultural Revolution. Already 500 000 people have been arrested, more than 150 people have died in prison, usually after having been torture. What I am describing here is the situation now, not the situation during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a duty to take an extremely firm stance. The resolution is a good text. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Malmström, who played an instrumental role in this task. The members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are certainly not aware of an incident which in another, less tragic, context might be considered amusing. At the meeting to discuss the compromise, one of the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists recommended that Falun Gong be excluded from this resolution, asserting that it was something other than a religion. Freedom of religion and freedom of conscience are part of the same concept and each of us must define it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are part and parcel of our democracies, and we expect them to be applied everywhere as basic principles so that the dignity of human life is truly respected throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">For a while it looked as if the situation were taking a turn for the better in the People’s Republic of China too. Sadly, in more recent times this appears to have changed, and progress seems to have not only been halted but even reversed. For example, I greatly regret that, while the People’s Republic of China has signed important documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the process of ratifying and implementing the two covenants has yet to be completed. That is a great pity. This process needs to be reactivated. I therefore appeal on behalf of my Group to the People’s Republic of China to respect people’s civil liberties just as we endeavour to do in our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add a postscript to the honourable Member Mr Dupuis, just to mention to him that the Falun Gong say that they are not a religious institution. We should also respect the way in which institutions define themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the repression against Falun Gong is totally absurd. Can you imagine repression against all the people who ever follow yoga classes in Europe? The Chinese Government goes so far as to imprison cyber-dissidents meaning people who create or manage websites whose content does not please the government like Mr Huan Qi who is being tried now.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you should stop supporting the EU/China human rights dialogue as long as it does not yield any result. Its only concrete outcome so far has been to prevent a resolution condemning China in Geneva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the opium of the people.” Marxism-Leninism is in terminal decline, but other ideologies have survived. China is far from permitting freedom of expression, let alone freedom of religious observance, for Tibetans, Mongolians and members of Christian churches or Muslim communities. The Tibetans are persecuted. It is an offence to display pictures of the Dalai Lama. Those who stand up for their beliefs face the threat of lengthy prison sentences. I recall the initiative of the Tibet intergroup of the European Parliament to propose the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, who has spent the last nine years in prison, for this year’s Sakharov Prize. The eleven-year-old Panchen Lama, the second-highest authority in Tibetan Buddhism, has been abducted and has since been cut off from the outside world. He was not even allowed to meet with Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group expects China, as a future WTO member and a global player, to assume its responsibility at long last and to ratify and implement the international agreements on civil and political rights as well as those on economic, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the EU Member States to take the opportunity presented by the meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda.

The fact that a divided and backward country made a new start and started rebuilding its economy, in a way that was enthusiastically received by masses of workers and peasants, was felt as a threat by the outside world. Over half a century later the heirs to that revolution are still in power. Their ideology and the enthusiasm of the population have gone, but unfortunately they have retained their dictatorial traits with a vengeance. For this regime, economic growth and political calm are of supreme importance and as a result anything that runs counter to them is attacked fanatically. That bodes ill for ethnic and religious minorities and those with political criticisms. Organisations are banned, people are locked up and death sentences are liberally used. Small, powerless countries that breach human rights at home, rightly attract foreign criticism. In the case of China, the most populous country on earth, things are usually different. People with widely differing political views say that it is a large and important country that may become a major trading partner and that we must therefore stay on good terms with it. My group believes that an end should be put to this special treatment. Human rights, including freedom of religion, cannot simply stop at the Chinese border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the situation appears to be getting worse and worse. Torture is on the increase. There is frequent use of the death penalty. Freedom of expression is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group is very worried about this and appeals to the Commission and the Council to put increased pressure on China regarding human rights issues. The world cannot look silently on as the world’s most populous country systematically engages in violations against its citizens on a daily basis. We have high hopes that the Swedish Presidency will succeed in bringing about a united approach prior to the Geneva meeting in a month’s time and then, in the course of the meeting, will get a resolution passed concerning China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese have extremely limited opportunities to practise their religion. Catholics report systematic persecution. Mosques are burned down. In Tibet, the oppression of the Tibetan people, especially of Buddhist monks, continues. Torture, re-education camps and imprisonment under unacceptable conditions are the rule rather than the exception. We know that there are now at least 600 political prisoners in Tibet, most of whom are monks and nuns.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last year, we have been able to see, on TV screens throughout the world, the harsh offensive launched by the Chinese régime against the meditation movement Falun Gong since the latter was banned in July 1999. Ever since the ban, tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested. At least 137 people have died in prison. Thousands of cases of torture, atrocities and ill-treatment are also being reported, as is the fact that thousands of people are in work camps and countless individuals have been punished with imprisonment following summary trials. That is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Falun Gong has been branded an evil sect, but one might well wonder if the reason for the hatred felt towards this peaceful movement does not lie, rather, in the threat it constitutes to the Communist system, because it unites so many people. However, Falun Gong practitioners are entirely peaceful and have no political ambitions other than to be allowed to exercise their basic rights – rights which are laid down in the Chinese constitution and in international agreements signed by China.</p>

Parliament’s report states that the protocol can be seen as part of a broader process in which the Union aims to encourage political, economic and social growth as well as stability in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much room for improvement when it comes to the situation regarding human rights in Laos. It is appropriate that human rights there should be discussed at the same time as increased cooperation. We have given a lot of attention in Parliament to the question of Burma. But things are hardly any better in neighbouring countries. Laos is one of the world’s poorest countries. All the negative features of a one-party system are manifest there. There are barely any signs of greater freedom of speech or the liberalisation of political life there. In October 1999, a demonstration was organised in front of the presidential palace against the ruling powers. Those who took part in it have not been seen since. Amnesty says that they were arrested and have been languishing in prison camps without trial. Meanwhile, Mr Thongsouk Saysangkhi, who died in prison in 1998, belonged to a group of three ministers and a high official who had been attempting to change the administrative machine from within. They were convicted of treason.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has tried to aid the development of Laos, despite the human rights problems. The EU has given EUR 120 million in aid to the country; the United States has given 23 million, and Japan 132 million dollars. The Laotian people, who live in dire poverty, need help, but the country’s internal situation gives cause for asking just who is really benefiting from the aid being given. There are regrettable examples of projects where the army and the government have reaped the benefit instead of the local inhabitants. Laos is rich in natural resources and, were there democracy there, would have real potential for development. In a parliamentary statement Laos is being urged to sign, ratify and enforce the UN’s conventions on human rights, to free prisoners of conscience, and to guarantee freedom of the press. The importance of these objectives should really be clearly emphasised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, Parliament requested the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience but this request was ignored and since then at least one of them, Mr Tchongsouk Saysangkhi, has died in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">After 25 years of Communist rule, the people of Laos are today hoping that their country will follow the path of transition to democracy and are calling for free elections. The Laotian Government, however, continues to stamp out any peaceful demonstrations, such as the one held on 26 October 1999 and, more recently, on 17 November 2000. The organisers of the earlier demonstration were arrested and are still in prison. The leader of the second demonstration, Mr Phommachaul Phannolath, was also arrested along with other demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before the House denounces these human rights violations and reminds the Lao People’s Democratic Republic that, as a partner of the European Union through a Cooperation Agreement signed in April 1997, it undertook to promote and protect all human rights. The Lao PDR also showed its commitment to this by signing two United Nations conventions on human rights in December 2000. This commitment must henceforth be backed up with real action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Lao PDR is taking on the role of coordinator of relations between the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations until 2002. This role gives it further responsibilities in promoting the concepts and values on which the partnership is based. I hope that Parliament will give its support to the European Union’s strategy on the region as well as to all the people of Laos who are working towards democracy and for national harmony within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise resolution is well-balanced, clear and specific. On behalf of my group, I would urge you to support it so that the European Parliament can make its voice heard in this troubled area of the world.</p>

For more than five months hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hemmed in between the warring sides. In the border area between these countries, called the ‘Parrot’s Beak’, they are caught like rats in a trap in fighting between Guinean troops, shadowy rebel movements and the gang of murderers known as the United Revolutionary Front.</p>
<p class="contents">The personal commitment of the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Lubbers, in this crisis area is very gratifying. His proposal for the establishment of a safety corridor, which will enable refugees to return to their home countries quickly, deserves international support.</p>
<p class="contents">But, all this is not enough. The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled. For example, it would be a good idea to institute an international boycott against the trade in ‘blood diamonds’, in which this border area is so rich.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that the international community should present a united front against those principally responsible for the present degrading chaos in West Africa - a task in which the Security Council of the United Nations should take the lead.

Charles Taylor originally came to power through violence and terror, with the sole aim of obtaining control of the diamond trade. He later exported violence to neighbouring Sierra Leone by arming and training the RUF, one of the most savage rebel movements on earth and now the Hitler of West Africa is exporting violence to another neighbour, Guinea. Guinea is in a certain sense the victim of the fact that it admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia into its territory, including members of the rebel group opposed to Charles Taylor. The Conakry regime has sometimes reacted in a very unfortunate way, but let us not mistake our adversary. Liberia is the destabilising factor in the region. In any case, according to my information it is incorrect that Guinea is refusing to transfer refugees to areas further from the border. The international organisation for migration has in fact already begun moving a first group of 35 000 refugees. It is clear that a safe corridor must be created as soon as possible for the return of these people. Europe could definitely give unconditional support to the ECOWAS plan for stationing observers in the border area. If violence persists, the Union should also call within the UN for smart sanctions against the leaders of Liberia. European Member States that flout the ban on the import of so-called blood diamonds, must be strongly condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, Mr President, I feel that the Council should also investigate reports of possible support from France for the regime in Liberia. The situation is critical. If a Sierra Leone scenario is repeated in Guinea there is a risk that in addition to Central and East Africa, West Africa too will be caught up in a spiral of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, they refused to join the armed forces. I think anyone who has read Ahmadou Kourouma’s book ‘Allah Doesn’t Have To’ will be familiar with the tragedy of the child soldiers forced to join possibly revolutionary but most certainly bloodthirsty armies such as the United Revolutionary Front.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say, like Mr van Hecke, that a safety corridor to allow the mass evacuation of refugees must be established immediately, as it is, indeed, a matter of urgency. The Guinean Government must allow the victims to settle in areas that are further from the fighting and the borders. In my view, that is the least it could do.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it is justifiable and understandable for Guinea to defend itself against any incursion. I am even of the opinion that the territorial integrity of a state like Guinea must be protected. However, the Guinean Government must also prevent paramilitaries acting in the place of legitimate armed forces and perpetrating acts of violence on refugees. I share the view that Guinea is not solely responsible, but I feel that it should do this, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the decision of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to use troops from West Africa must be supported and must come into force as soon as possible, as it may provide good protection.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the European Union should put intense pressure upon Liberia to end its support for forces such as the URF. However, Guinea is also partly responsible for the current situation, and is, even so, a country that regularly violates human rights – no one in the House could forget the imprisonment of Alpha Condé. I believe that it is important to reiterate that, in a country that has no respect for the most basic democratic principles and where the slightest opposition is quashed, it is not surprising, although it is extremely regrettable, that one of the regime’s opposition parties has joined the rebellion and allied itself with the URF.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is to say that Africa is in urgent need of democratic rule and genuine economic development, which will improve the fortunes of all people. We can help to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question to put to the Council. When will our governments cancel the debt owed by third-world countries, knowing as they do that this is the cause of wars and poverty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first, that did not apply to Guinea. Despite the poverty, it offered a safe refuge for refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia. Now Guinea, too, is caught up in a regional struggle for power. There is nowhere else for the refugees to go. Thousands are hiding in the jungle or are wandering fearfully in the heat without food, water or hope. If a corridor is not quickly created, an unparalleled humanitarian disaster threatens. There is a great deal at stake. The whole region seems to be heading for chaos. The purchase of weapons is more important than feeding people. Above all, Charles Taylor must take Liberia in hand. It is harrowing to see how indulgently Europe, too, is reacting to this catastrophe. What is the European Union doing, I ask the Commissioner, and when will the petty tyrants in power finally concern themselves with the lot of their people? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effect on human rights is graphically illustrated by the case of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu, a 17-year old mother of a young child. Despite having lodged an appeal against her sentence of 100 lashes, the sentence was carried out in January without even her lawyers being informed. They were still preparing the case for her appeal in court. No attempt has been made to bring those who abused and exploited her to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This case highlights the increasing anxiety about human rights abuses in Nigeria. People of different religious beliefs have coexisted peacefully in Nigeria in the past, yet George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on his recent visit to the country, underlined the growing international concern about developments there. The Christian minority are not allowed to build churches or to teach their religion in schools. In areas where Muslim law is enforced men and women are not allowed to travel on the same public transport, and boys and girls have to be taught in separate schools. In the state of Kaduna it is estimated that 2000 people have been killed in fighting between Christians and Muslims over plans to introduce the new Islamic code of law. Yet human rights groups of both faiths are now campaigning on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we have before us sends out two clear messages. The first is that we in the European Parliament are not prepared to ignore human rights abuses anywhere and so we condemn without reservation the treatment of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu and call upon the Nigerian Government to prevent any repeat of such abuse in future. But the second is that we are also making a commitment, as a parliament, to support the creation of a democratic and just society in Nigeria by strengthening the dialogue between ourselves and that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had no contact with her but I separately put down a motion for my own group and I speak on their behalf on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">My good friend Thomas Mann spoke about the denial of the right to practise religion in one part of the world. But it is just as serious when human rights are denied because people want to impose their religious beliefs on other people. Whether it be the imposition of one's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one's religion, one is as bad as the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite hard to be moderate in the language we use to condemn this barbarous and cruel act which took place against a 17-year-old girl in Nigeria. A girl who claimed she had been forced to have sex but failed to produce in court the witnesses to support her claim. The cruelty of the sentence, and the fact that she had given birth one month before, makes it very difficult for us to accept any assurances from the government of Nigeria that they are protecting the civil rights of their people and their own population.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that we in the European Union and the United States of America are the main trading partners of Nigeria. We are the people who buy and sell almost all the things they want to buy and sell. We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with. I would ask the European Commission to take into consideration standards of human rights in all the aid schemes and cooperation schemes that the European Union puts into effect. This is the worst we have heard of to date but we understand there are amputations taking place in Nigeria for relatively minor offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people condemn globalisation, but if there is one good thing about globalisation it means that the world becomes interdependent and we have at least some pressure we can apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Article 18 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Since 1991, Islamic Sharia law has applied in Pakistan. The precepts and prohibitions laid down in the Koran are the supreme law of the land. The law against blasphemy has palpably impaired the largely peaceful coexistence of Muslims with Christians and other religious minorities. Freedom of expression and the freedom of the press have been severely curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, journalists – seven of them this time – have been arrested on the flimsy pretext that they allegedly distributed anti-Islamic writings. It looks once more as if the whole purpose of this is to make a public example of them. But it is far more serious than that, because they could be sentenced to death. We call on General Musharaf’s military government to restore the independence of the judiciary and to delay no longer in allowing the courts to conduct proceedings in accordance with sound legal principles. The Blasphemy Act must be repealed. It is being interpreted in an absolutely arbitrary manner and opens the door to all sorts of manipulation and malicious lawsuits.</p>
<p class="contents">The death penalty is rejected by a great majority of the people‘s representatives, not only in Europe but also in a growing number of Asian countries. It must be abolished. The PPE-DE Group calls on the European Commission to review all its agreements with Pakistan as a matter of urgency and to revise them as necessary. We need cooperation agreements with the human rights organisations and with the regional non-governmental organisations. The paramount aim of our initiatives must be to ensure that Pakistan can at last resume its journey towards a free democratic system of government.</p>

<p class="contents">It is true that the living standards of the majority of the Chinese population appear to have improved during the last twenty years. Thanks to the economic reforms and to liberalisation, there have been increases in freedom and personal autonomy. It is true, however, that there is still a big gap between the international commitments made by China and the human rights situation in practice. In 1996, a human rights dialogue between the European Union and China was established and, within this framework, we are maintaining a frank debate on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">A key topic is religious freedom, about which the European Union repeatedly expresses its concern faced with Chinese repression of religious and other types of activity to which you have referred. We are talking not only about the Catholic and Protestant Churches, but also about any other type of faith. Later, I shall be talking a little about Falun Gong.</p>
<p class="contents">Other topics raised with China are the repression of political dissent, the arbitrary conditions of detention, the frequent recourse to the death penalty and the repression of ethnic minorities. We are also urging China quickly and without reservations to ratify the United Nations’ International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which we consider to be key factors for improving individual rights. The human rights field is one of the priority areas of our work, in which I believe we can improve our relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">As we very well know, dialogue is only an option, the purpose of which is to produce results. There is no justification at all for maintaining the dialogue if no progress is being made. The European Union’s General Affairs Council openly expressed this point of view in its conclusions concerning the human rights dialogue between China and the European Union, published on 22 January.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred specifically in your speeches to three topics which I think are of interest. Firstly, I should like to point out that, where Falun Gong is concerned, the Commission is especially concerned about the reports we are receiving about torture and ill-treatment inflicted upon followers of the movement, as well as about the severity of the sentences imposed upon some of its members. The Commission has therefore repeatedly urged China to review these sentences. We think that all the safeguards need to be fully respected in fair trials in which adequate defences are mounted.</p>
<p class="contents">As you may know, a decision has not yet been made about the European Union’s position on the Geneva resolution on China. The debate we have held today in this House will, without a doubt, be fundamental to the decision we take.</p>
<p class="contents">As for action in connection with Tibet, we are indeed still concerned about the ethnic minorities there. I should also like to point out, regarding this matter, that China has been urged to make further progress towards fully respecting the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people and to enter into an open dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the situation in Laos, I should like to assure you that the Commission fully shares your concern about protecting human rights in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It is true that, in the last year, some positive signs have been visible, for example the signing of the two United Nations covenants on human rights: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The problem now is for the National Assembly to lose no time in ratifying these covenants and putting them into effect, and the Commission is waiting for this to happen. Even if this step is successfully taken, however, there still remains a lot of work to be done. A cause of special concern for everyone is the intolerance of, for example, political opposition, as demonstrated by the detention of a number of people in October and November 1999 for demonstrating against the government. You refer in your report to the situation of former civil servants, such as Mr Latsamy Kamphoui and Mr Sackchittaphong, prisoners of conscience who are still being detained and whom the European Union has repeatedly called upon the government to release on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters. I can certainly assure you that the Commission will specifically use the EU-ASEAN meetings as a bilateral context in which to raise all these problems. These meetings will take place in Brussels in the first six months of this year, and we shall be talking about everything I have just mentioned and also about the separate and specific problems you have raised about actual cases of political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Guinea, I should like to point out that we are concerned about the situation in that country, and especially about the ongoing deterioration in the human rights situation as a result of the attacks suffered by the United Revolutionary Front. We fully support CEDEAO’s attempts at mediation. You raised the problem of refugees. The Commission believes that absolute priority should be given to rehousing them in the camps farthest away from the border, that is to say as far away as possible from the combat zones. As matters stand at present, repatriating them to Sierra Leone is unthinkable because two other objectives have priority: reinforcing the camps around Kissidougou, north of Gueckedou, and adapting the access roads to these camps. The Commission is pursuing a two-pronged strategy through ECHO, on the one hand in the framework of the year 2000 intervention plan for Sierra Leone’s refugees through which an amount of more than EUR 2.5 million has already been allocated to the operations in Guinea and, on the other hand, in the framework of the contracts which have been entered into with the associated NGOs and which are being modified to take account of recent events. ECHO is also preparing two funding decisions for 2001: one in favour of Sierra Leone, for EUR 11 million; and the other in favour of Guinea, for between EUR 3 and 6 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Two additional topics commented on during the debate were the responsibilities of Liberia – what can be done? – and the problems in Guinea. With regard to Liberia, I should like to point out that, as you have indicated, the experts’ report from the United Nations on arms and diamonds in Sierra Leone makes it crystal clear what Liberia’s responsibilities are in the conflict. At present, possible courses of action to be taken against Charles Taylor are being debated. What can the Commission do in the meantime? We can use the tools available to us and, with that in view, the possibility is being examined of instituting a consultancy procedure with regard to Liberia in application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. With regard to Guinea, the situation has indeed deteriorated. Recently, the death penalty was imposed upon five people and, as a number of you also pointed out, the subject of Alpha Condé has not been clarified. The Commission passed on the concerns that are felt about this specific matter to a Guinean delegation headed by the Foreign Affairs Minister, which visited Brussels at the end of January.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Nigeria, I should like to point out that the Commission condemns the flagellation of an adolescent in accordance with Islamic law and is concerned specifically about the application of the <span class="italic">Sharia</span> in some areas of Nigeria. The Commission is aware – as I believe you too are – of the fact that the situation in Nigeria is politically very sensitive and that the new, democratically elected government is endeavouring to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria. The Commission and the Member States will be meeting in March to try to reach some common position on Nigeria. The meeting will consider what is the best way to deal with these various topics. In the meantime, you ask what we are able to do. A mission from Brussels is discussing, in Nigeria, how the future programme for that country is to be implemented. The issues of democracy, the constitutional state and respect for human rights will be dealt with as a priority with a view to the decisions that have to be made regarding them.</p>
<p class="contents">The final subject you raised with me was the subject of Pakistan. In accordance with the resolutions you tabled concerning freedom of expression in Pakistan, the Commission acknowledges that the incident which recently occurred at the border post of Peshawar is cause for alarm and especially regrettable in view of the fact that, to date, Pakistan has generally respected the freedom of the press, especially since the military coup of October 1999. It is true that, compared with other countries in southern Asia, its attitude is, or has been, relatively commendable. However, the incident makes it clear that the European Union should remain alert to the issue of freedom of expression in general and freedom of the press in particular. There is the fear that the existence of an independent and diverse press, permitted until now by Pakistan – one of the most liberal of Islamic countries – may be compromised. In spite of the public apologies offered by the editors of the newspaper, <span class="italic">Frontier Post</span>, there is indeed no guarantee that no action will be taken against them. If action is, in fact, taken against them, it will undoubtedly help create an atmosphere hostile to the press in general. We therefore believe it is vital to carry out a very detailed investigation of the incident in order to determine whether possible interests that have not been clearly defined have led to the paper’s being closed down. Apart from all this, the legitimate concern for the safety of the newspaper’s staff is, as a number of you have pointed out, connected with the application of the law on blasphemy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the military government should make a major effort to control religious intolerance in Pakistan and regrets that earlier initiatives to change the blasphemy law were blocked. In the specific political discussions with the Pakistani Government in November 2000, the troika, while congratulating the government on its commitment to respecting human rights and media freedom, indicated that there were still problems in a number of areas, particularly when it came to judicial practices and the restrictions upon the activities of political parties. The troika also took the opportunity to indicate its concern about the concessions being made to a number of groups advocating intolerance. There is no doubt at all that, in the absence of a democratic counterweight, the influence of such groups can increase. That, then, is what the Commission is doing to improve the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to support any actions taken by civil organisations in Pakistan, with such actions to be funded through the European initiative in favour of democracy and human rights. It is also examining the possibility of supporting means to improve public administration in Pakistan, which would be to everyone’s advantage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
