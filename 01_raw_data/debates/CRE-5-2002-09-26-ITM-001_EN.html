<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Söderman,</span></span>   <span class="italic">European Ombudsman</span>. – Madam President, on 1 September 1995 the Ombudsman's office started work. From then until 15 September 2002, the office received 10 535 complaints, of which 10 437 have been examined.</p>
<p class="contents">We carried out 1 385 full inquiries of which 19 were own-initiative inquiries. 1 149 of these cases involved the Commission, 137 cases involved the European Parliament's administration, 53 concerned the Council and 12 concerned the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the results, 345 cases were settled by the institution concerned, after the Ombudsman had informed it of the complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">In 206 cases a critical remark was made, in 48 cases the inquiry resulted in a draft accommodation or proposal for a friendly solution, most of it achieved a success for the complainant.</p>
<p class="contents">In six cases a special report was made to the European Parliament, in four of these cases Parliament upheld the Ombudsman's recommendations, and two other cases are still pending.</p>
<p class="contents">In 659 cases, a thorough inquiry resulted in the Ombudsman finding that there was no maladministration in the activities of the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">When cases are outside the Ombudsman's mandate, we always try to advise the complainant of another body that could deal with the matter. We advised the complainant to go to the national or regional Ombudsman, or petition a national or regional Parliament in 2 293 cases, to petition the European Parliament in 884 cases and to address the Commission in 913 cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, critical voices have been raised, saying that the Ombudsman is not sufficiently known, and that the results for citizens are inadequate because the institutions neither cooperate nor respect their obligation of good administration. Some critical voices have also suggested that the mandate is too narrow and that the European Ombudsman should deal with complaints concerning Community law wherever it is applied in the Union or even be a People's Tribune, always ready to condemn injustice wherever it occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman is certainly one of the best-known ombudsman institutions in the world. Our information campaign is in 12 languages and addresses 350 million citizens and residents of 15 Member States. We have visited every Member State, issued press releases, published information brochures and given many lectures and seminars to publicise the work.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most effective ways of communicating with such a vast audience is via the Internet. Around 2 500 websites contain an active link to the European Ombudsman's site and nearly 42 % of complaints are now submitted electronically, many of them using the on line complaint form.</p>
<p class="contents">The steady increase in the number of complaints is the best proof that the Ombudsman is better and better known. Almost 200 new complaints arrive each month, nearly a 300% increase compared with the first full year of cooperation in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Ombudsman's work for European citizens are also impressive. As well as obtaining redress in individual cases, we have achieved major improvements in the general functioning of the institution. Three of these call for special mention.</p>
<p class="contents">First we persuaded the institutions and some bodies, including the European Central Bank and Europol, to improve public access to their documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, an own-initiative inquiry led 17 institutions and bodies to adopt codes of good administration, based on a draft suggested by us. Following a special report, the European Parliament last year adopted a revised version of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. We have distributed this improved version of the Code widely throughout the institutions and to European citizens, whose right to good administration the Code embodies. As instructed by the European Parliament, we apply the Code in deciding whether or not there is maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">The third achievement concerns the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed in Nice in December 2000. The Ombudsman proposed the idea that the Charter should include the right to good administration. This was included as Article 41 of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has also promoted the full and correct application of the Charter. The Union institutions solemnly proclaim the Charter to the citizens as embodying their fundamental rights. The Ombudsman therefore regards the institutions' failure to respect those rights in their own activities as maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Ombudsman's proposals to the European Convention include the idea that the Charter should be legally binding wherever Community law applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what the critical voices say, the institutions and bodies deserve credit for their mainly cooperative attitude to the Ombudsman. They have usually responded properly, fully and promptly to the Ombudsman's inquiries and have been willing to accept the Ombudsman's friendly solutions and draft recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems have arisen in only a small number of cases. In one case concerning access to information, the Commission rejected the Ombudsman's draft recommendation and has failed to act on a resolution of the European Parliament supporting the Ombudsman. I regret that this case seems to be part of a more general trend towards the misuse of data protection rules to halt or reverse the commitment to openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the institutions and bodies have also adopted a code of good administrative behaviour. I still cannot understand why Parliament's resolution of September 2001, calling for a European administrative law, has not been followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">To me, a uniform set of rules applying to all the institutions and bodies could only enhance the Union's relations with its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that the Staff Regulations maintain the outdated requirement of prior approval of publications by civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that the European Ombudsman's mandate is limited. I have consistently maintained the view that a network of ombudsmen and petitions committees is needed to supervise the application of Community law by the Member States. We have developed such a network, to share information, give advice and ensure that complaints go to the most competent body.</p>
<p class="contents">Further development of the network could help the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, to focus its resources on the most important issues of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens can never fully believe in the European Union unless Community law is respected at all levels of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In future Community law, the Member States could include the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The network of ombudsmen in the Member States could also play an essential role in supervising the application of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman would be ready to accept responsibility for referring fundamental cases to the Court of Justice, if no solution could be found in a normal ombudsman investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do hope that Parliament's representatives in the on the European Convention will support these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my thanks to all the institutions and bodies, above all to the European Commission, which has cooperated effectively with the Ombudsman to the benefit of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions for their good advice and support. Special thanks are due to the chairman of the Committee, Mr Gemelli and the rapporteur dealing with the Ombudsman's Annual Report this year, Mr Wyn. I thank you. I welcome their proposals for closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, which I hope will lead to a concrete outcome to benefit the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wyn (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, it is my pleasure in this report to endorse the annual report for 2001 submitted by the Ombudsman, which is a comprehensive and detailed overview of the activities conducted during the year and in particular of all the various cases processed.</p>
<p class="contents">After seven years, the role of the European Ombudsman – to enhance openness and democratic accountability in the decision-making and administration of the European Union – is well established. By tackling maladministration in the Community institutions and bodies, the role of the Ombudsman has made an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions are truly taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen. The fact that the number of direct complaints is still on the increase again in 2001 clearly demonstrates that the Ombudsman is reaching more and more people in the course of his activities. Despite this steady rise in complaints, the report welcomes the reduction in time taken to deal with each case.</p>
<p class="contents">The present Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, from whom we have already heard, has become a well recognised and respected figure in the European Union and his receipt of awards such as the Alexis de Tocqueville prize further demonstrates this. He has even paid a visit to my own country, Wales, showing a commitment and dedication through his work to visit some of the most important places in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">During his time in office he has emphasised the Rule of Law, taking fundamental rights seriously and applying basic principles of good administration, such as transparency, responsibility and respect for citizens. This has been done in no less than 15 Member States and through the medium of 12 Community languages. He deserves his retirement!</p>
<p class="contents">The report very much welcomes the fact that the European authorities are increasingly taking action to settle a complaint once they are made aware of the problem in question and that, in other cases, a friendly solution has been arrived at.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman must also be commended for his efforts to inform more citizens of their right to complain. This is a matter that the Committee on Petitions is continually aware of. This means that the Ombudsman's work has to include the continuous updating of his website with a view to making his role known to an ever-wider public and to establishing networks of links with regional ombudsmen.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard the Ombudsman is faced with, on the one hand, wanting to inform as many people as possible of this right to complain and, on the other, remembering that the remit of his office is limited to the Community institutions. We in Parliament have a role to play here, in ensuring that we remain aware of the Ombudsman's role and informing citizens of this right.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Ombudsman, however, has not been without obstacles during this period. In the field of good administration the European Parliament adopted unanimously last September the European Union Code on Good Administrative Behaviour and called on the Commission to propose a regulation on the subject. I welcome the Ombudsman's decision to apply the principles set out in this code in his activities. I should like to express my disappointment here, however, that the Commission has yet to act on this important request. The report calls for Parliament to consider drawing up a legislative initiative report on the basis of this model code under Article 192 and Rule 59.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to openness and good administrative behaviour this report notes attempts by certain institutions to use recently adopted data protection rules to impose confidentiality on their activities. It must be made clear that data protection rules are mainly concerned with the protection of private and family life and certainly should not in any way restrict the information available to citizens on the activities of the European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the infringement procedure, the Article 226 procedure, in which the Commission investigates complaints about infringements of Community law by Member States, which continues to be the subject of complaints to the Ombudsman – and this is something with which we in the Committee on Petitions are all too familiar – the report finds that, despite recent improvements, this procedure is secretive, and that the complainant is still not recognised as a participant. Delays occur because the Commission has too many cases to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman was on the record for criticising the Commission's recent handling of the Greek environmental complaint, in this case involving infringements of Community environmental law by the Greek authorities; enquiries revealed a catalogue of information being concealed, the wrong directive being applied and a failure to ensure that the case was dealt with impartially. Whilst we appreciate the hard work carried out by the Commission, the Ombudsman and our Committee on Petitions depend on their investigations being effective, and we must be confident that such cases are being handled correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the offer by the Ombudsman to develop joint activities with the Committee on Petitions with a view to reinforcing the contacts and exchange of experience with national and regional Ombudsmen and committees on petitions. Closer cooperation between the European Ombudsman's office and the Committee on Petitions is vital. Our work is very much interlinked and we were provided with excellent examples of how this could be achieved when the Ombudsman addressed the Committee on Petitions in April. I commend the report to the House and wish the Ombudsman a very happy retirement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And there are very specific reasons why not. These reports concern two fundamental rights – the right of petition and the right of complaint – of European citizens. These rights are inextricably linked to their nationality and are the main means of consolidating political control by the European Parliament of where and how Community law is being applied by the Community institutions and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These petitions and complaints give us a very specific idea of the degree to which European citizens' expectations of Europe are being fulfilled. We can, to a large degree, give real expression to the aim of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, the promised strengthening of the democratic credentials of the European Union and, more especially, of the European Parliament, and the much-vaunted objective of greater transparency, by properly developing the institutions of petition and complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, I should like, if I may, to invite my honourable friends to carefully study these reports and the proposals, all of which are designed to increase the reliability of the Community institutions and ensure that measures taken are implemented more efficiently. Many of these proposals can be implemented within the framework of the current Treaties. Others need the Treaties to be revised and the report drafted by Mr De Rossa on behalf of the Committee on Petitions for the president of the convention on the future of Europe is of interest here. In both cases, whatever else, these issues should be at the top of the agenda of the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the proposals contained in my report, which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Petitions, I should like to start by commenting on one which I consider is of both practical and symbolic value. Parliament examines three reports every year. The first is the report by the Committee on Petitions, examining the petitions filed by European citizens on shortcomings in the application of Community law by the Member States. The second, the Ombudsman's report, examines complaints about the failure of Community institutions to comply with Community law. The third, which is submitted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, concerns the application of Community law by the Member States. In other words, three reports which are directly related and have common objectives and which do not warrant separate consideration. They should be dealt with jointly in a part-session with as much publicity as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in view of the fact that, one way or another, all three reports involve national authorities, such as national parliaments, national courts and national administrative departments, and many of the issues touched on in them depend on their degree of involvement and control, I think that the possibility of these reports being debated in the European Parliament in the presence of representatives of the national authorities should be addressed. This will improve cooperation, especially with the national parliaments, and the debate will gain maximum publicity and incite the interest of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to emerge from the study is the increased number of petitions and complaints which, from one point of view, is a good thing, because it shows that citizens are broadly involved in the exercise of these rights. But, after a certain point, it creates practical problems which need to be addressed. Obviously these problems will increase with enlargement. So, sooner or later, we will need to set these institutions on a new footing. To be precise, we shall need to examine the possibility of decentralising services with the help of national ombudsmen or committees on petitions and, possibly, the offices of the European Parliament in the capitals of the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other proposals which merit consideration, but there is too little time for me to comment on them. I shall confine myself to a few words on the content of the report. Social issues were again the most sensitive area in the year under review. Problems connected with free movement, such as violation of the right of residence, double taxation, failure to safeguard insurance rights, environmental issues and the recognition of diplomas and skills. What is encouraging is that, in numerous cases, once the relevant national authorities were contacted, petitioners obtained justice. It is also encouraging that there has been an increase in the number of collective petitions, i.e. petitions with more than a thousand signatures. The potential of collective petitions is something we should be looking at, because it also involves non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, it would be a huge oversight on my part, in view of the imminent departure of the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, if I were to fail not just to congratulate him but to express my admiration for the work he has done, work which justifies the institution of the ombudsman in the eyes of the citizens of Europe and leaves behind it an important heritage which needs to be safeguarded and strengthened in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the annual debate on the activities of the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman focuses our attention on the relationship between citizens and the institutions. This relationship is fundamental, and forms the basis for all our policies since ultimately they are addressed to the citizens. It is therefore important that once a year Parliament, the Ombudsman and the Commission take stock of how this dimension is taken into account in their regular and day-to-day activities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this year the debate is different for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, work on the Convention is in full swing. It will map out the future of Europe, and both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have referred to that body the issue of citizens' rights through proposals concerning, on the one hand, the right to petition, and on the other, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, an administrative law and means of appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, has told Parliament that he wishes to stand down at the end of March 2003, so this is the last time that he will present an annual report to this Assembly. Allow me to take this opportunity to thank Mr Söderman, on behalf of the Commission, for the work he has carried out since he was appointed in July 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">As the first EU Ombudsman, he has played a pioneering role, helping to bring about a real change of culture within the Commission, and I am sure that this also applies to the other institutions and bodies. In addition, his own-initiative enquiries have also had direct consequences, and resulted in positive administrative reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention some of them. Firstly, the Code of Good Administrative Conduct which, it should be stressed, was the result of an initiative by Parliament when adopting the Perry report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 1996. Then in the recruitment sphere, there have been firstly the removal, in two stages, of the age limit in competitions and, secondly, the Ombudsman's success in obtaining the right for any participant in a competition to have access to their corrected papers. Both these things required quite a change in administration and tradition in the institutions. Lastly, his efforts have prompted us to organise more structured relations between complainants and the Commission in infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the areas in which the institutional relations between the Ombudsman – often supported by Parliament, moreover – and the Commission have led to genuine progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to return briefly to the Code of Good Administrative Conduct, because the reports by Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis raise this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that from the outset the Commission was receptive to Parliament and the Ombudsman. It has drawn up various drafts starting in 1998 and now under the present Commission it has drawn up and adopted its own Code of Conduct aimed at the citizen, binding in nature and corresponding to many of the points in the Code of Conduct drawn up by the Ombudsman himself. This important work led the Commission to amend its own Rules of Procedure in October 2000. Not all the institutions have acted in that way. Of course there remain certain differences compared with the latter code, as the Ombudsman, Mr Perry, and now Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the Commission code represents real progress. Of all the codes adopted by the institutions, it is the one which corresponds the most closely to the Ombudsman's proposals. It entered into force in November 2000, and a first evaluation report has now been finalised. It will be circulated shortly. The Commission is well aware that, despite all its efforts, the European Ombudsman would like to go further. He has in fact referred this issue to Parliament in a special report, with the result that a year ago Parliament expressed itself in favour of a single harmonised code for all the institutions. This is still the position today of your rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission realises that the situation is not totally satisfactory at present since European citizens are confronted with different standards of good administration depending on which institutions they contact. However, the Commission is not in a position at present to launch a legislative initiative. The first report on the application of the Commission code covers only a few cases, as you will no doubt see, and we know nothing about how the other codes are being implemented by the other institutions. In addition, as I have just mentioned, discussions are in progress at the Convention concerning the adoption of an administrative law, and we should undoubtedly wait for its results. I notice in this connection that the proposal made by the Ombudsman to the Convention provides for the adoption of such a law within one year of the entry into force of the Treaty. It seems to me that this gives us some room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, while it is true that an interinstitutional approach aimed at the adoption of a single code and a single law is no doubt useful, the fact remains that the situation in each institution is specific, and a degree of flexibility is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go through all the points raised in the reports by Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn, but I must say that relations between the Ombudsman and the Commission, although cordial and very productive, may from time to time give rise to disagreements in the context of institutional relations. While the Commission pays tribute to the work accomplished by the Ombudsman, the fact remains that there are still differences of opinion on certain points. Firstly, there is the question of the application of the relevant provisions of Regulation 1049/2001 to infringement dossiers and how to interpret the data protection directive. However, I will not repeat here the position expressed on behalf of the Commission by Mr Bolkestein on this latter point or the opinion expressed by the Commission concerning the proposal to amend the rules governing the Ombudsman. Both Parliament and the Ombudsman are well aware of these positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to return for a moment to the report by Mr Koukiadis on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions. The Commission shares the rapporteur's main concern of organising more efficient working and cooperation conditions between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions. Incidentally, as the President and some Members will know, I have personal experience of very well-organised cooperation with the committee in a specific case.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the text, the prospect of enlargement should prompt us to improve our procedure still further and, in this connection, I would reiterate the Commission's willingness to debate a review of the interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament on the examination of petitions. The Commission also agrees with the rapporteur about cooperation with the national parliaments and with the national administrations as part of the efforts to find solutions to problems raised by petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude with a few points which should be made at this time of institutional deliberations. One of the objectives of the Convention is to bring the institutions closer to citizens. In this context, there can be no question of reducing the possibilities with regard to exercising the right of petition, but rather of consolidating them or providing a framework for them. In addition, it is clearly very important, as part of the clarification of the institutional system, that citizens should be aware of the various means of appeal available to them at the various levels of the institutional machinery. The Commission therefore welcomes the contributions by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, and undertakes to examine them constructively. Moreover, by adopting a constructive dialogue approach, the Commission, the Ombudsman and the European Parliament will make the best possible contribution to defending the interests of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, we are debating the last annual report which will be presented to the Parliament by Jacob Söderman. Today is not the time when we say farewell, but it is a moment to appreciate the work that Jacob Söderman has carried out and his efforts on our behalf and very much in the interests of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union institutions are inevitably a large and complex bureaucracy and, of course, there are going to be mistakes and administrative errors. The institutions seek to minimise those errors, and they must be prepared to listen to advice on how to do that. The Ombudsman is there, as we all know, to act as the arbiter in a fair and objective way. I would say to the Commission that they must think long and hard before they reject any of the Ombudsman's findings.</p>
<p class="contents">I been appalled to come across examples where the Commission has blatantly rejected the Ombudsman's findings. Without going into details, I have a letter here from Mr Prodi to one of my colleagues. The Ombudsman found there had been maladministration and the Commission flatly refused to reverse the situation. Mr Prodi writes: 'I am convinced that the solution we offer is the most suitable in the light of the specificity of the case and I am disappointed that your constituent does not see it this way'. It is hardly surprising that the MEP concerned has written to me in the Committee on Petitions to say that the reply from the President of the Commission is preposterous. It is impossible to defend that before the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry in some sense that it is Commissioner Liikanen who is here this morning. I always appreciate his words and certainly acknowledge the good relations between his department and the Committee on Petitions. I was very heartened to hear his words this morning about the Commission's preparedness to look at the review of the inter-institutional agreement. The time for that is certainly getting very close.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make stronger points about the Code of Administrative Behaviour. Last December, Commissioner Kinnock promised to this House that we would receive a review on the workings of the voluntary Code. We are yet to see it, although we have heard it will come in the near future. To my mind, it is already a year late.</p>
<p class="contents">A code has to be binding, it must not be a voluntary code; and it also needs to be consistent. The citizens of Europe do not distinguish between the institutions of the European Union. To them, Brussels is one place, Strasbourg is somewhere else. They want a consistent code across each of the institutions. I have analysed the voluntary code of the Commission and compared it with that proposed by the Ombudsman. In over 70% of the articles, there are differences. Some differences may be small, but some are very big indeed. The Commission code does not explicitly recognise the need for courtesy. There is no provision for an apology or correction of mistakes. The Commission code is very weak on access to documents and on discrimination: it does not recognise that discrimination can be based on language, membership of a national minority or even appearance. The Commission's code says staff shall not be guided by personal interest. The Ombudsman's code says the official shall not take part in a decision in which he or she or any close member of his or her family has a financial interest. I would urge the Commission to be more relaxed about it, to listen to the code that is proposed by the Ombudsman and endorsed by this House, and to accept it. It should be in the forefront, it should not say: 'Well, none of the other institutions has done so'. I know that is the case. Nevertheless, the Commission is in the driving seat here and should be much readier to accept the advice, coming from friends, which will enable it to face the citizens of Europe much more confidently.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to say that the Committee on Petitions had a recent meeting with the Danish presidency at which the presidency expressed its willingness to look at the new interinstitutional agreement. We have the communication from the Commission on complaints and petitions, and we now have Mr Liikanen's proposals. The time has come for us to have that new interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to say that we can congratulate ourselves on having had the courage, in 1995, to entrust this great task to – if I may say so – a rather unknown representative of a new Member State. I would like to congratulate Jacob Söderman on having focused our attention on the essential matters, namely the total reform of the European institutions, in which secretive dealings of one sort or another gave way to the principle of openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I also thank our Ombudsman for the very quiet, calm, but determined way in which he did his work. We know the examples, and that we could not take an easier way, but we see from the successes chalked up by the administrations in the EU's northern countries – Finland, Sweden and Denmark, which score lowest on the index of corruption – that there is no such alternative. I share the disappointment expressed earlier at the spectacle, over and over again, of the hesitancy manifested by the so-called Brussels bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area in which we need to press on. It was not least this opacity, this inability to identify what was going on, that brought down the European Union's last Commission. By touching on sore points, Mr Söderman has done the right thing. Let us recall the delayed payments. The Commission is one of the worst bodies in Europe when it comes to paying up, yet see the self-assurance with which it lays down rules for all economic actors, while itself being in fact incapable of making payments in a proper manner! In the most simple terms, this is about bringing administration closer to the citizen. It is the experience of all of us, again and again, that the people back home talk about how big our bureaucracy is in Brussels. We know that it is a very small one, but it acts big.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, as rapporteur for the Budget, that I am a little ashamed – although I am aware that it is mainly the fault of the Finance Ministers of the fifteen Member States – of our manifest inability to equip the European Ombudsman's office with the staff its importance warrants. We in Parliament are doing our best, and we will find a solution, but the finance ministers obviously think that enlargement is not actually in the offing and that the Ombudsman will not need extra staff. This really saddens me, and it is something I have to say in the hearing of many members of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis has been laid on the good cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. It is Jacob Söderman's leadership that has given us the modern institution of a European Ombudsman. Now, perhaps, it is our responsibility, and that of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament as a whole, to bring our activities up to a comparable standard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like everyone else, I am thinking particularly of transparency and good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We note that, yesterday, the Ombudsman once again pointed out the misuse of data protection, that is to say of the personal data laws, to prevent the transparency we desire. I want MEPs to be aware of the fact that the Ombudsman is pointing in this case not only to the Commission but also to Parliament. We must turn the focus upon ourselves when we reflect upon how we work. I also see that Mrs Hautala, who is one of the rapporteurs in this area, is present in the Chamber. We are talking with forked tongues today in Parliament too. It is also interesting to see that, in the ongoing consultation procedure on data protection, at least four Member States have proposed significant changes. I hope that we in Parliament will support these changes when they reach us.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour,<span class="italic"> </span>I have to admit that I do not properly understand Commissioner Liikanen’s approach, the consequence of which is that the Commission is now unable to do anything. Like many Member States, we noted that the discussion on good governance had opened up possibilities. In Parliament, we have spent a long time studying the legal base for the proposal tabled and are left in no doubt that there are legal possibilities there. Why waste time when it is a question of doing something that will benefit people?</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there is now better cooperation, I personally am extremely disappointed at the Commission’s response to our initiative regarding the Ombudsman’s statute. The amendments we tabled were very modest and not at all extensive. I therefore hope that the Danish Presidency can instead achieve some success in this area. The Ombudsman needs to be able to carry out his work in full.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, Mrs Corbey raised an issue in Parliament concerning the ways in which the Commission helps people to resolve issues and solve problems in connection with the application of Community law. It seems to me that the Commission is at a complete loss here. The <span class="italic">Solvit</span> system, which will shortly be presented in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has been introduced, while <span class="italic">Eurojust</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>referred to by Mrs Corbey, is not being maintained. <span class="italic">Citizens Direct </span>is being launched, but without any real success. We have a lot to do in this area. It is very unclear how the Commission is to utilise resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like Parliament itself to reflect upon how we deal with the complaints that come in. We shall prepare the legislation on the recognition of examinations later this autumn. It is an area in which we have received a great many proposals. It nonetheless seems as if many people prefer not to take account of these proposals but, rather, to stick to national legislation and not accept the signals coming from our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in my view, is most gratifying about this debate is the fact that the Commission has declared itself willing to study the interinstitutional agreement and how we are to handle complaints, something which, as Mr Perry mentioned, the Danish Presidency is also prepared to do. There is a window of opportunity this autumn. We must use that window in order to improve the position of our citizens and not wait until the Commission takes the initiative. We should also study the Ombudsman’s draft Convention as it relates, for example, to recourse to the EC Court of Justice, for there are some problematic issues where the conflict has not been solved between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Ombudsman and Parliament, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I say a big thank-you to Mr Söderman, who speaks the same beautiful, and most easily understandable, form of Swedish as I do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I believe we must make improvements in certain areas in order to prevent the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman from confronting problems while carrying out their everyday work.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on a very practical level, I believe we should strengthen the services of the Ombudsman, the services of our own secretariat and the services of the European Commission which work closely with us, Commissioner, because sometimes they have difficulties providing us with information on the petitions we send them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the presence of the Council in our Committee on Petitions should sometimes be essential, but it never appears. I believe that time limits should be reduced, otherwise we will lose credibility. We should renounce those Member States which obstruct the work of the Committee on Petitions. There are some and we all know who they are. We should be able to suspend projects that violate Community law and Europe’s natural and cultural spaces.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that the method of a joint report by the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman should also be used for the joint annual report on respect for and application of Community law, because that would show us how essential the work of the Ombudsman and the work of the Committee on Petitions is in assessing the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Madam President, by thanking the European Ombudsman for his work promoting the transparency and efficiency of the European institutions and furthermore for his independence, which has been clear to us throughout this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also appreciate very much the work of the Ombudsman in developing the network of ombudsmen across the whole of Europe and in other countries. This leaves a very sound basis for his successor and my group would also like to add their thanks for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention to Conclusions 9 and 16 of Mr Wyn's report on the work of the Ombudsman, and to the lack of progress in one particular case. Some people have already referred to this and I was Parliament's rapporteur. This case raises serious issues of what happens when Parliament upholds the Ombudsman's view on a case, this one relating to data protection and access to information, and the Commission does not agree. It raises questions of institutional balance, as well as issues surrounding the application of data protection itself. The lack of a conclusion so far certainly means that the complainant is left in limbo, not quite understanding what it means when elected Members can come to one conclusion and the Commission another. What is the way out?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at that as well as to consider the future role of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, especially with the development of competences in the field of justice and home affairs and also with enlargement. While we are looking at the role of the institutions I would also like to reinforce Conclusion 11 of Mr Koukiadis's report which mentions the Council's 'lack of enthusiasm' – very tactfully put I felt – with regard to the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thors has already mentioned issues about the mutual recognition of qualifications. One of the other big problems we have in making progress in certain cases, especially those relating to the environment – such as waste disposal, water quality, etc. – are the delays at national level in providing information to the Commission. Despite some of the criticisms of the Commission, at the level of the Committee on Petitions we generally work very well together.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to Conclusion 18 of the Koukiadis report, which has already been mentioned by Mrs González Álvarez and talks about the possibility of introducing interim protective measures which suspend actions. We do not say this lightly, but sometimes we get the impression that delaying tactics are put in place by Member States and authorities to allow projects to go past the stage where they might be halted. That needs very serious consideration in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union. As a directly elected representative of the people, I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee. I would like to offer Mr Söderman my fullest congratulations on an outstanding tenure of office. He came to Strasbourg with already considerable experience in defending citizens' rights in his own country. Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one. There is no doubt that in areas such as openness, transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people, the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Söderman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year. He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post. Informing citizens about this important office naturally requires time and resources, and it is true that work remains to be done in increasing the profile of the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Whoever Mr Söderman's replacement might be, and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way, he will have a lot to live up to. Mr Söderman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe. He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long, cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is as a matter of principle that I wish to reiterate this, having read this great tome that comes out every year and found that he has achieved an enormous amount. It is lamentable that the Committee on Petitions is prevented from playing the part to which it might do justice by the excessive inadequacy of the resources with which it is equipped. The Committee on Petitions must be a real point of contact for citizens, but the Council should also take even more account of it. The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens. This might present an opportunity to do this at this level, and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombudsmen and with committees on petitions. The European Union will always find it difficult to be recognised in the Member States as the servant of the people that it is meant to be.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, more attention needs to be paid to Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is where it is enormously important that the Charter should become legally binding and be incorporated into the Treaties. If we do not manage to force this through, we will find the European Union's credibility hard to defend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Hardly a year has passed since we debated the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions for 2001 – for which I was rapporteur – and I am pleased to note that the right of petition is increasingly strengthening the political control that the European Parliament can exercise in relation to excessive violations of Community law. This also allows us to assess the state of the application of that law within the Union and the degree of satisfaction amongst the citizens with the Community institutions, which are absolutely essential in a Union which is so large, so multi-faceted and sometimes so disconnected from those institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is taken up superbly in the report by Mr Koukiadis which, furthermore, comes at an historic moment for the Convention, which should not sidestep – this would be a great mistake – the strengthening of the right to petition and the enlargement of a uniform administrative code of conduct. For all these reasons, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koukiadis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we once again regret – and this aspect is also taken up in the report we are debating – the lack of attention the Council is paying to this inalienable right of the European citizens, since the Council is still absent throughout the process, and this at a time when it is trying to gain more power for itself, to the detriment of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are delighted at the intention to introduce preventive measures to prevent abuses of cultural and environmental heritage – which, by the way, are issues which are at the forefront of the European citizens’ concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by insisting also that we should investigate procedures aimed at effectively remedying the national authorities’ lack of willingness to cooperate with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament. We must study them and implement them as soon as possible. We have had enough of the lukewarm positions of the Council and the national governments. As the rapporteur suggests and as has been proposed in corresponding reports in previous years, we should even go as far as to renounce, in press conferences, the obstructive and reticent attitudes of the governments to the resolutions of Parliament’s Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would also like to wish Jacob Söderman all the best for his Iberian retirement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must safeguard the financial resources of the Ombudsman’s office. This is something that is not always taken sufficiently seriously in Parliament’s Committee on Budgets. I will use the same figure of speech the former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the former Soviet Union used referring to the present Chairman of the Russian Social Democratic People’s Party, Mikhail Gorbachov: the Ombudsman must have iron teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to human resources management in the EU the Members of the Commission act as both prosecutors and judges. This is shown once again in the case of Martha Andreasen. It would be appropriate if the impartial Ombudsman were also to look into that person’s punishment. The present system does not provide legal protection. It would also certainly be worth the Ombudsman’s while to undertake an own-initiative enquiry and report with regard to the administrative practices of the European Central Bank. The bank’s openness and the transparency of its administration represent the worst standards in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Ombudsman in his annual report should have to state that the EU institutions have failed both to put the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and implement the decision on the European Parliament’s good administrative behaviour. The remarks about administrative discrimination on the grounds of age or gender are particularly regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the annual report there are 21 photographs of the Ombudsman, and in most of them he has a gentle expression on his face. When it is a matter of a departure from good administrative practice the friendly exterior should deceive nobody. Our Ombudsman acts fearlessly, like Jaakko Ilkka in the Finnish Cudgel War, against the tyranny of the administrative nobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Ombudsman has appealed to the Convention proposing that he should in some cases be able to refer violations of fundamental rights to the Court of Justice of the European Communities. This is a notion that should be taken seriously, because the Ombudsman seems to be the sole European institution that is really founded on the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. All the other institutions seem instead to be backsliding with regard to its demands, although it is the very institutions themselves these demands should be binding on.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to raise a point made in the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, which is absolutely crucial with regard to what Mr Kronberger said about strengthening the powers of the Committee on Petitions so that it could represent and defend the rights of citizens. Point 5 of Mr Koukiadis’s report states the notion that the Treaties should provide the possibility for citizens to initiate reform of Community law by petitioning the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I ardently support this view and believe that, as we are discussing opportunities for citizens to have an influence, we should at long last include citizens as participants in the decision-making process and not just as the subjects of that process. We might take an example from a country like Switzerland, where the people can indeed initiate the legislative process. I believe we need such initiatives if we want the public to accept that the European Union has jurisdiction over their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, in particular, to thank the European Ombudsman, together with whom we have witnessed within the Committee on Petitions a fruitful experimental encounter between different legal traditions, with progress made towards the achievement of major goals in terms of the development of procedures to implement<span class="bold"> </span>the right of petition and make it a reality, with reflection on the Interinstitutional Agreement and, most importantly, as far as the Ombudsman is concerned, with the development of the network, with the realisation on the part of the regions of Europe of the essential nature of the relationship with the citizens which is established through the regional ombudsmen.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this work must continue because the right of petition is related to the citizens’ awareness of their European citizenship. The more the citizens become aware – and they are becoming aware – of their European citizenship, the more they enter into dialogue with the European institutions. While many Members have focused on the way that petitions can contribute to the supervision of the European institutions, I would like to emphasise precisely the relationship of trust created between the citizens and the European institutions through the right of petition, and, therefore, the recognition of these European institutions, whose competence is wider than that of district, provincial, regional or State bodies. We, the Committee on Petitions, are continuing this process to make the right of petition efficient and effective, and we<span class="bold"> </span>associate the initiative with the Perry-Kessler report, which for us was fundamental and in which we established points which we are gradually endeavouring to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently attempting to create a relationship between the Parliamentary committees, for they have to be aware of what the citizens are saying in their petitions so as to be able to decide whether to fill a legislative gap or whether to amend or reinterpret a directive. That is why we requested and received own-initiative reports, precisely in order to illustrate the citizens’ problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would point out that the Convention on the Future of Europe is in progress, working towards drawing up a constitutional treaty. In view of that, this is an important opportunity, particularly to ensure that greater importance is attached to the views of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Söderman has carried out his task with infinite patience, particularly in regard to the Commission which has shown no understanding of elementary administrative culture. It is difficult to sustain optimism, however. I do not want to suggest that Mr Söderman has given up, but the fact that the EU’s competent and patient Ombudsman has chosen to retire early is a signal that the Commission’s absolute power is too overwhelming. Absolute power does not only result in passivity; it is revealed in the active opposition to the Ombudsman’s efforts to introduce the Nordic countries’ administrative culture into the institutions of the EU. A couple of examples: freedom of expression is practised as the freedom to employ several hundred million euro on spreading EU propaganda, in conjunction with the ruthless censorship of critical voices. One has only to read about the latest victim of the arrogance of power. Her name is Marta Andreasen. Data protection is used not to protect citizens’ private lives but to secure the Commission’s monopoly on knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s right to gather uncensored information is sabotaged outright by the Commission. I would take the liberty of referring to the Ombudsman’s brilliant answer to the Commission’s scandalous statement of 6 March of this year, a statement characterised by the Ombudsman in terms of the negative points of view and false assumptions it contained. There is a long way to go. With his latest report, Mr Söderman deserves a big thank-you for having tried to make the way shorter, but his departure gives new topicality to the issue of whether we shall ever reach the end of the road or only remain at the start of it. Is the EU system, characterised as it is by absolute power, simply resistant to the Rule of Law and democratic accountability? There are an appallingly large number of witnesses to the fact that the answer might be in the affirmative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was here, fifty-three years ago, that the Council of Europe was set up, and where it still has a special concern for human rights. It was here, fifty-two years ago, that the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted, our neighbour the European Court of Human Rights being its fruit. It was here, fifty years ago, that a European Parliament met for the first time. This week has found us observing its fiftieth anniversary. It was here too that we had our first joint session with the European Council's Parliamentary Assembly, which might well have been rather tricky in technical terms, but I must say that those responsible overcame the difficulties brilliantly. This was also a long-awaited opportunity to build stronger links between these two institutions, the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Strasbourg is also the seat of the European Ombudsman, who expresses our vision of a citizens' Europe, a Europe of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already frequently been said that Brussels, being the home of the Commission and of the Council, is increasingly synonymous with bad administrative practice. I consider this rather unfair, and have to say so too, as Brussels is where the administration of the Council and the Commission does much that is exemplary. Indeed, the present Commission – and I have for some years been numbered among the great critics of the Commission – and Mr Liikanen as well, have done much to systematically improve its administrative practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, there is still a staggering amount remaining to be done. Unlike Mrs Hautala, I do not believe that the introduction of more direct democracy will win the public over to European integration. What works outstandingly well in the small democratic structure that is the canton of Appenzell, will not work in the same way in a Community with half a billion inhabitants. The end result would be a society governed by hysteria, in which politics would be run by demagogues in television companies. What we need is decentralisation and the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said today about the Nordic culture. I welcome that. The Ombudsman is a Nordic invention, but we are not the Nordic community; we are the European Community. The concept of supranational law is a Roman achievement. That is why I was very glad to hear something Mr Gemelli said. ‘What is decisive,’ he said, ‘is that people are aware of their European citizenship.’ You can say it in Latin just as well: ‘<span class="italic">Civis europaeis sum.</span>’ Only when people can say that will the unification of Europe have been achieved. That is why we need good administration, clear principles of human rights, and Europe as a Community based on the Rule of Law! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want, however, to emphasise that Mr Posselt and Mr Liikanen have made an important point. We must have institutions that fight for citizens’ rights in the EU. We must have colleagues who show that they are in favour of securing citizens’ rights, but that is not enough in itself. It is our task to ensure that citizens are also given resources to campaign themselves for their own rights. It is our task to guarantee that the individual is not powerless before the institutions of the EU. That, moreover, is precisely the job of the European Ombudsman. It is therefore also our task in the European Parliament to ensure that the Ombudsman is given the opportunities and the tools that make for the right working conditions, including access to documents and the opportunity of talking with employees and obtaining clear answers. I would urge the Danish Presidency to make efforts along these lines in order to ensure that the European Ombudsman is able to operate as intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinos (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, may I too start by congratulating the European Ombudsman on what is indeed a valuable job extremely well done, before commenting on the excellent report by my honourable friend, Mr Koukiadis, and drawing the House's attention in particular to two points which, in my view, should be included in the Treaties on the occasion of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns point 17, calling for ways to be considered of persuading the national authorities to respond to petitions by citizens and questions asked by the Committee on Petitions and the Commission. We often encounter indifference or have to deal with obstructionism. The rapporteur and the Committee on Petitions unanimously adopted the following proposal which I had the honour of tabling: "In the event of indifference or obstructionism on the part of the national authorities, the national media should be informed of this negative attitude and of the content of the petitioner's complaint." As we all know, nothing affects or upsets national and local authorities more than their illegal acts or omissions or even their indifference towards their citizens being publicly exposed. This publicity could be achieved by issuing press releases in the language of the country in question and by organising press conferences in which national MEPs, especially the members of the Committee on Petitions, could participate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to point out that the Committee on Petitions receives huge numbers of petitions complaining about works planned or under way or conduct on the part of national authorities which violate mandatory Community rules, often resulting in irreparable damage to the environment or European cultural heritage. Proceedings resulting in convictions by the European Court are so time-consuming as to be useless, because the damage has already been done and cannot then be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe we should find ways of preventing damage pending a final decision by the European Court, where a petition has been referred to it. As you know, temporary prohibitory or mandatory injunctions can be issued under national legislation, preventing damaging activities from starting or continuing until a decision is taken on whether or not they are legal. This motion proposes something along similar lines and we should ardently support it. Otherwise, what happens if a natural habitat is destroyed, for example? It cannot be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that if we safeguard the rights of the citizens and provide them with sufficient protection, we can also call upon them to discharge their responsibilities. In my opinion, this should be the main consideration. We must therefore consolidate these rights, and the way to do so is through the right of petition, which provides the individual citizen with the possibility of appealing to a dedicated body which can then carry out controls, whether it is the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions or the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly welcome the cooperation between the two institutions, which I feel has been an extremely positive development. The network is up and running and is constantly improving, and I therefore feel that access must be further facilitated. Improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies, but I believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible. Therefore, we still need to do much more in terms of disseminating information. It would be useful, for example, for all the publications issued by the European institutions for the public to read to contain, in future, a section on how to contact the Ombudsman and how to contact the Committee on Petitions, so that the individual citizens are provided with the possibility of receiving help at those times when they consider that the public administrations are not doing their duty and that their rights have been infringed, and to ensure that they are aware of the existence of this facility. This would help us to improve our structures because, in actual fact, if we are aware of real or alleged malfunctions, we will be able, not least as Members of the European Parliament, to take appropriate measures to address them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on a very personal note. In 1995, Mr Söderman, I voted for the occupant of the office adjacent to mine, who was not yourself but Mr Siegbert Alber. It is therefore with even greater conviction that I thank you most sincerely for your work and for your efforts on behalf of the citizens. Thank you and good luck for the rest of your term of office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finland is a bilingual country in which the linguistic minority enjoys a high level of protection, as I should like to demonstrate. Secure protection for minorities is something we could certainly export to many corners of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate in Parliament today, almost everyone stood by the same values. There is consequently not so much to say about this debate, but I should like to express my gratitude for all the kind words spoken in my honour. You must all appreciate that those words really also apply to everyone else who has been involved in the same process including, of course, all the MEPs who have taken an interest in the Ombudsman’s work and provided encouragement through their advice and criticism. They also apply of course to the institutions represented today by Mr Liikanen and by the officials Mr Massangioli and Mr Godts, who have done a lot of work in conjunction with their colleagues to produce answers for the Ombudsman and to ensure that issues are straightened out.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Ombudsman does not do much other than head up the work. I should also like to thank my staff for the sound work they have done and for the high level of motivation they have shown in their desire to help all European citizens. Finally, I only hope that my successor – and, as you know, there are a lot of very good candidates – will be given the same stimulating and business-like reception as I have been given. In that way, I believe that the citizens of Europe will thrive in the wake of my retirement. I shall no doubt accept the invitation to visit sunny Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
