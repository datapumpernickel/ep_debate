Therefore, in order to pursue the Northern Dimension policies beyond 2003, intensive preparatory work was launched a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I recall that the guidelines for a new Action Plan were set out at the Ministerial Conference on the Northern Dimension and the Arctic Window in Greenland in August 2002, and the subsequent Foreign Ministers’ Conference in Luxembourg in October of that year. In line with these guidelines, the Commission established contacts with all the relevant actors, including regional organisations and associations and representatives of the private sector, with a view to preparing a working document on the new Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 June this year, the Commission submitted to the Council the working document ‘The Second Northern Dimension Action Plan, 2004-2006’, which incorporated a number of suggestions presented by the relevant actors and took into account experience gained with the first action plan as well as the new demands for the coming years. This document was then examined by the Council on 29 September 2003 and later endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 October 2003 in Brussels. On that occasion, it was underlined by the Heads of State or Government that the Northern Dimension will assume increasing importance in the context of the Union’s enlargement and will have an important contribution to make in carrying forward the Union's new neighbourhood policy throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plan for 2004–2006 lays down the guidelines for the next three years. In this respect, it guarantees the continuation of the Northern Dimension of the Union’s policies, defined in the document as a ‘horizontal concept that applies within the existing financial and institutional framework in the relevant region’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension is particularly important for certain priority sectors in which potential added value is greatest, such as the economy, business, infrastructure, human resources, education, culture, scientific research, health, the environment, nuclear safety, natural resources, cross-border cooperation and regional development, as well as justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The common framework for the promotion of political dialogue and practical cooperation that the Northern Dimension provides will cover a broad, diverse geographical area around the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic. Special consideration will be given to regions with specific needs, such as Kaliningrad and the Arctic region. In the context of the Northern Dimension, increased interaction at all levels between Russia and the EU will therefore be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will keep its overall leading role but all relevant actors, whether at national, regional or local levels, from the business community or from civil society generally, will be called upon to play an active part. Specific activities in the five broad priority sectors just mentioned - the economy and infrastructure; education, culture, research and health; the environment, nuclear safety and natural resources; cross-border cooperation and regional development; justice and home affairs – need to be carried forward in a cooperative spirit based on inclusive participation for all, subsidiarity and complementarity, with an effective division of labour and overall coordination and monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission continues to work actively on the Northern Dimension. In parallel to implementing the measures in the First Northern Dimension Action Plan, the Commission has played a decisive role in drafting the Second Action Plan for the region. This Second Action Plan covers the period 2004-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As a follow-up to the preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency last year, the Commission carried out an open and integrated consultation process in the first half of 2003, involving the most important partners. This proved to be a very useful exercise. The Commission also took account of the European Parliament’s resolution of 16 January 2003. In June 2003, the Commission transmitted its proposals for the Second Action Plan to the Council. After discussing these, the Council adopted the final version of the document, which was approved by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels of 16 and 17 October 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the Second Action Plan is, in the interests of both sides, to provide an instrument for regional cooperation with our neighbours, the Russian Federation. In addition, the intention is for the Northern Dimension to address the opportunities and challenges that might arise from the forthcoming enlargement. In other words, it is intended to contribute to promoting stability and prosperity in this region, both inside and outside the borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension policy will also contribute directly to achieving the aims that we have just discussed in our debate on a wider Europe and the new neighbourhood. Finally, the new Action Plan will make a contribution to the sustainable development of the Arctic region and the indigenous peoples who live there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has been working hard on the continued implementation of the First Action Plan. It should of course be concluded by the end of this year. In this context, several of the results that have been achieved most recently are worthy of mention, for example: the implementation of the first projects in the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment Programme in the Russian Federation and the extension of cross-border cooperation as part of the drafting of the first neighbourhood programmes following the Commission communication of July 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we forget the large number of projects and specific initiatives implemented by the Commission that have already been completed or are still underway as part of Community programmes, which also contribute to making the Northern Dimension a reality. The 2003 Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the Northern Dimension Action Plan will provide a complete overview of all of the sectors in the First Action Plan. The Commission will be publishing this report in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should also remember the significant contribution made by other players, for example the Member States, regional organisations and regional and local authorities. Only with the active support of all of the stakeholders in the region can the Northern Dimension be a complete success. This is an aspect that we have particularly highlighted in the Second Action Plan. The Commission will obviously continue to keep Parliament informed about the implementation of the initiative, and we hope that Parliament will play an active part in the monitoring and review initiatives that will take place in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The good news is that the Council and the Commission say the Northern Dimension is alive and well. The bad news is that nothing much is happening within its framework, except that Parliament, the Council and the Commission are vying with one another to try and extend and at the same time dilute the concept, so that soon it will surely cover the whole of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="contents">In the region of the Baltic basin and northwestern Russia, however, there are things happening all the time in which the European Union should also be economically involved. The issue of maritime security, or non-security, is one of them. The Union is enlarging and in four months the border between Russia and the Union will have doubled in length. The agreement over Kaliningrad is in danger of becoming a major quarrel as no one seems to be telling Lithuania what is happening or if anything is happening at all. It was amusing to read in the minutes of the EU-Russia Summit about a fast-track feasibility study being made by the end of 2003. That is now six weeks away and the Lithuanians, at least according to what their former president said yesterday, know nothing about it. The northern gas pipeline is probably going to start being built within two or three years which is to go from the Arctic Ocean, past Finland and via the Baltic to Central Europe. Its route from the Arctic to the Baltic lacks infrastructure and it will also presumably pass through primal forest that needs protecting. The Russians will not manage alone in this.</p>
<p class="contents">A big fuss is made from time to time in the Union about the risks associated with nuclear waste and nuclear power stations in northwestern Russia. Within the framework of the TACIS programme, however, there is a substantial amount of unused resources set aside for nuclear safety projects – some EUR 180 million. Why, then, are these not used for cleaning up nuclear waste in the sea at Litsa Guba and Murmansk, by which I mean decommissioned nuclear submarine reactors and nuclear waste on the shoreline, or ensuring that the power stations at Sosnovibor and Kandalaksha are safe to use? The Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, which is coordinated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is an excellent tool. It should also be used elsewhere than in just one project. The St Petersburg Southwestern Wastewater Treatment Plant is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Northern dimension still remains on virtually only a verbal level is by no means the fault of the Community. I point the finger at Finland’s present and former governments, for example, for which cooperation in the neighbouring regions does not seem to have been or be worth the bother of initiating any powerful lobbying to spur the European Union into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its continuity is demonstrated by the fact that we are discussing the Second Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension, however, as was said earlier on, has been criticised as being shapeless and accused of lacking in anything concrete. This forthcoming programme for the period 2002 – 2006 will hopefully eliminate these problems. The programme promises to put in place a coherent operational framework for all Northern Dimension policy by creating strategic objectives and priorities. The Northern Dimension will not acquire sufficient credibility until it helps to improve the life of people in the EU’s northern regions and those areas bordering on them. This means developing the economy by exploiting the potential offered by trade and the sustainable use of natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In northern regions environmental questions are also vitally important. After enlargement the Baltic will become an internal sea of the EU, and its protection will require swift action not only in the European Union but also in Russia. It is good news that the Russian Prime Minister on his visit to Finland this week gave his support to European Union efforts to discontinue the use in the Baltic Sea of single-hulled oil tankers. Environmental cooperation must be continued in order to improve nuclear safety, and wildlife in the Arctic also calls for special attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Plans and agreements made in the area of health and social protection must also be turned into projects of concrete cooperation. The New Neighbours initiative, which was being discussed here just a short while ago, will give strength to the EU’s Northern Dimension. Added value will be afforded in particular by the new financial instrument proposed in it which, for example, will reduce bureaucracy in border cooperation. The Northern Dimension nevertheless also needs sufficient new financial resources for it to be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the Baltic countries and Poland, which have been major partners in EU external relations, join the Union they will give the Northern Dimension strength both in the EU’s internal development work and its external relations. The enlarging EU is reorganising external relations with its eastern and southern neighbours by creating the Wider Europe and new Neighbourhood Policy. The Northern Dimension’s future crucially depends on how well we can link it with this wider scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the Wider Europe Policy, the EU will still enlarge and develop its relations with its European neighbours. Added to that are the Northern Dimension and the Southern Dimension aspects of EU policy, which also extend outside Europe. It is natural that the New Neighbourhood Policy and the new neighbourhood cooperation finance scheme should also be implemented in northern regions. It is precisely in the north that the new finance scheme could be applied as a pilot project before it is adopted generally, as is proposed in Mrs Napoletano’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is above all about cooperation with those areas of Russia which are close to the EU’s borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our group is concerned, we wish to focus attention on the word ‘cooperation.’ There is a need to foster cooperation among people as well as just companies. Besides money we also have to export social welfare and democracy to the northern neighbouring regions. Our group supports projects to prevent the sexual exploitation of women and children and to combat the disease and social problems that poverty brings with it. Poverty causes sickness.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not pleased with the way the Commission has handled the issue of the EU’s Northern Dimension. It has to be more than just a policy on Russia. The Commission has been unable to create any substance to the projects recorded in the programmes. The same unfortunately has to be said for the countries to hold the presidency this year. Neither Greece nor Italy mentioned the Northern dimension in their list of priorities. They have pulled homewards in the direction of the Mediterranean, even though the country to hold the presidency has an obligation to create projects throughout the Union as a whole. Prime Minister Berlusconi has been interested more in Russia’s warmongering dimension rather than peace, ordinary cooperation with people and their social well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that the special features of the EU’s Northern Dimension will be trampled underfoot by the new Wider Europe – Neighbourhood Policy. Nature dictates different preconditions for life in the north from those further south and those regions need their own distinctive policy. The draft resolution jointly proposed by the political groups is comprehensive and only needs implementing, which is the Commission’s responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for such reasons that the Northern Dimension is still awaiting its big breakthrough. Its importance is revealed, however, when we look for example at the risks associated with nuclear power in our neighbouring country, Russia, or its recent internal policy. The stability of Wider Europe depends, furthermore, very much on whether we can achieve effective regional and cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said here, when the EU enlarges, the Baltic Sea will grow in importance and hopefully at the same time so will opportunities for more solid cooperation in order to enhance its ecological and political future. I would just like to remind everyone here of the perils associated with Russian oil consignments, which are very much on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan is a useful survey of the key regional challenges but it is completely lacking in any strategic view of the areas of focus that should be promoted, in particular concrete and measurable short- and mid-term objectives, or how cooperation with the various intergovernmental, NGO and other existing forums should be exploited to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to raise the separate matter of the status of the EU’s only aboriginal people, the Sami. They should have considerably more political influence than they do. The original means of livelihood and way of life of the Sami should be protected, which also means resolving local issues of land ownership and use in a manner that is satisfactory, as hard as that might be or painful to do. Will is the crucial element here too, however. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was privileged to attend on behalf of Parliament all three ministerial meetings that helped prepare this action plan, and there are two points which seem to have been overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension has to do with EU-Russia relations, but it also has to do with something much wider than that across the whole of the high north and the Arctic. We held one of the ministerial meetings in Ilulissat, Greenland, and I thought the window on the Arctic had been highlighted, but it seems instead to have been slammed shut.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arctic environment and its people concern us all. They are part of a global challenge which we have to answer and which we ignore at our absolute peril. We had the chance in the EU to show leadership in this by working with and through the Arctic Council and also, more importantly, by forging a partnership with the US in this area of the globe where we could work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that is missing is that of parliamentary and representative involvement at all levels. The first ministerial meeting foresaw the creation of a Northern Dimension forum. I was at a Nordic Council parliamentarians meeting yesterday in Warsaw, where the same point was made. We need parliamentary involvement at all levels to champion, advocate, scrutinise and move this policy forward so that it does not remain a phantom policy but becomes a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are of course quite right that the Baltic basin is one of the most dynamic regions in Europe, if not the most dynamic of all, economically speaking. But it is also a fact that after 1 May 2004 all of the countries bordering the Baltic Sea will be Members of the European Union apart from Russia. There will only be one single Baltic Sea country that is not in the European Union and that will be the Russian Federation. All of the others will be in. All matters relating to Baltic policy will in the future be EU-Russia policy. There is no escaping this. I think that in this respect the initiatives that we have developed vis-à-vis the Russian Federation significantly strengthen the Northern Dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Then you mentioned Kaliningrad. I admit that I am more than surprised by what you said here! The issue of access to and from Kaliningrad was not negotiated by the EU and Russia, but first by the EU and Lithuania and then with Russia. Each individual step was agreed with Lithuania. The study on the possibility of a fast train link is something that we arranged with Lithuania, and the Commission negotiated the conditions for such a study in great detail with the Lithuanian Government. I personally informed the Lithuanian President about the results of this work. The Lithuanian President cannot have told you that he was not aware of it! That is quite impossible. I would ask you to check your information once more, because I am very keen to avoid the impression being given here that we are doing anything that affects Lithuania’s sovereignty in direct relation to Russia. We are not negotiating anything with Russia that affects the sovereignty of Lithuania, our future Member State. I can offer you full reassurance here. There is no one who is more attentive to this than I am and I found the comments that you made on this quite astounding, to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Arctic region is concerned, which was addressed at the end, I should like to point out that the Second Action Plan, which I have reported on to you, makes specific provision for a major new initiative and activity on the Arctic Window; this will be one of the two major activities in this plan. This is decided; it is down in black and white. I do not quite understand therefore how you can say that the window has been slammed shut again, because the opposite is the case. The window is in fact wide open and I can promise you that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that all of the opportunities offered by this initiative are fully exploited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
