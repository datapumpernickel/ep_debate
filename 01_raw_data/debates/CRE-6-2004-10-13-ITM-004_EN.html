I would also like to wish all of you every success, and I hope that through the work of everybody, of all the institutions working together, we can realise the dream we all share: a better Europe at the service of the citizens and also a better Europe at the service of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, Mr President, that my first appearance before the honourable Members relates to an issue that has caused so much emotion, so much frustration and so much passion over recent years. The issue of the Middle East has a place in the hearts of all the citizens of Europe and we feel the suffering of the peoples of that region that is so close to us as if it were our own.</p>
<p class="contents">In Luxembourg last Monday, the 11th, the Council of Ministers of the European Union analysed this issue in great depth – as the honourable Members are aware – and approved a Resolution that I am not going to repeat, because I hope, and I am sure, that all of you have read it. I would like, however, in the short speaking time the Presidency is allowing me, to deal with three very clear and specific points so that we can focus the debate on them, if the honourable Members so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is our view of the recent events that have taken place in that region; the second is to analyse the political situation both in Palestine and in Israel; and thirdly, how the European Union sees the current situation and how, amongst all of us, we might find a way to speed up the peace process and thereby put an end to this spiral of violence we are caught up in.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, that of recent events, I would like to go back, Mr President, to the last meeting of the Quartet in New York on 22 September. I would like to emphasise four points from the document that emerged from that meeting, because some of them are important to the subsequent debate. Some of these points seemed perhaps to have been forgotten or to have been put to sleep, but fortunately, thanks to that meeting of the Quartet on 22 September, they seem to have recovered their place in people’s hearts. Of those four points, I will comment on the following: the need for reforms within the Palestinian Authority – we all agree on this – and also our complete and utter condemnation of terrorism. But that resolution also talks of the need to stop the settlements, of the fact that the members of the Quartet should take note of the Decision of the International Criminal Court on the wall and that we members of the Quartet want the process of withdrawal from Gaza, which has been put into motion in Israel, to be part of broader political process and that it should genuinely lead to a resolution of the problem in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, 22 September, the situation on the ground in Gaza has unfortunately deteriorated. What we have seen in recent days and weeks around Gaza has made us all suffer and, above all, has made us all reflect on what point there is to certain actions on the ground. It is true that at one point the violence began when Palestinian terrorists launched Qassam rockets in the north of the Gaza Strip, but it is also the case that Israel’s response has not been what we European democrats would have expected. It has been a response which we believe goes beyond what could be described as proportional: 119 deaths, a third of them of under-18s, amongst Palestinians; five deaths amongst Israelis, including two children. It is not possible to go on living in this spiral of violence, in which people die senselessly, and continue to die senselessly, and this whole process of violence does nothing to take the peace process forward a single millimetre.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we stop it? How can we stop this violence from continuing? We in the European Union have done everything possible over these weeks – in constant contact with the authorities of Israel, Palestine, Egypt and Jordan – to see whether it is possible to bring about a comprehensive peace, a comprehensive ceasefire. It has been impossible. We have not achieved it, and we have not even managed to bring about any kind of pause in order to deal with humanitarian issues. We therefore feel frustration, emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation was complicated even further by the terrorist attack on Thursday night in Taba, which was also dreadful. It was dreadful because of its senselessness, because of the people who died, Israelis taking their holidays, Egyptians looking after hotels, some European citizens who were there on holiday. I would, therefore, like to express my total condemnation of this attack which made sense to the terrorists: to try to destabilise a country, Egypt, which is cooperating in the peace process in an admirable way. I would, therefore, once again appeal to everybody who can hear us via this European Parliament for common sense, peace, an end to the violence, so that Israel’s process of withdrawal from Gaza can go ahead in peace and tranquillity, with no more victims on any side.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to comment on is the situation in Palestine: you know it very well; you are well aware of the European Union’s position. Palestine now needs a government, a Palestinian Authority with the capacity to act as such, as a government. We have asked, and we will do everything to ensure, that the rules which have been more or less agreed by President Arafat be signed by him, that he turn them into reality through a Prime Minister with real powers to operate in relation to what are fundamentally the elements defining a State: security, on the one hand, and the economy on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economic element, Mr President, I believe that our good friend the Minister for Finance is doing an admirable job. Everybody knows this. In the realm of security, however, there remains much to be done, and it is the responsibility of President Arafat to delegate real powers to his Prime Minister in relation to security; so that he can act and actually does act by means of his Interior Minister. Until this happens, it will be more difficult to combat terrorism, to control the situation in terms of terrorism, peace and order in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that it is very important that there be a clear interlocutor on the Palestinian side. Israel keeps saying day after day that it cannot find an interlocutor with whom it can discuss the peace process. This may become an excuse for those people who do not want to make progress, and the Palestinians should be capable of organising their own political life in such a way that that excuse cannot be used by those who do not want the peace process to move forward. I would, therefore, like once again to appeal on behalf of the European Union – just as my personal delegate, Mr Marc Otte, is currently doing in Palestine – for a Palestinian Authority capable of carrying out its responsibilities in terms of internal reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just in Palestine, however, that a situation of this nature is arising. I would like to point out that Israel is also currently experiencing a degree of political instability; this may also have repercussions for some of the measures being taken at the moment. The negative vote two days ago in the Knesset raises a political problem for Prime Minister Sharon with regard to the decisions to be taken on the plan to withdraw from Gaza: the essential vote on funding, on the process of disengagement from Gaza, I believe, is also creating difficulties within Israeli political society. Over the coming weeks, therefore, it is very likely that we will see new political realignments in Israel, which may even lead to the formation of a new coalition government. In any event, however, it is also very probable that the elections scheduled for 2006 may have to be brought forward to 2005 for the reasons I have just explained. Anyway, as far as we are concerned the important thing is that the peace process does not move any slower than it is at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the road map talked of a peace process that should lead to two States by the end of 2005. The most we will have in 2005 is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, nothing more. And that is a great failure on all our parts and very specifically on the part of Israel and Palestine and on the part of the Quartet and the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the recent statements made by certain Israeli politicians are not acceptable to the European Union. The nerve of these statements is completely unacceptable, to us at least. To say these things about the meaning of disengagement from Gaza, the meaning of a complete and utter rejection of the road map, which the Israeli Government has endorsed, seems to me to be something we must condemn in the clearest possible terms. We cannot accept that way of working in politics. That kind of statement leads to a lack of trust, not only amongst us, but throughout the Arab world, in the neighbouring countries, amongst the Palestinians themselves and amongst a large section of Israeli society, and we cannot go on like that. To say one thing and then say the opposite in the newspapers is not an honest way to behave in politics. And it is not just any person who is saying it, but a person of weight, a significant and important person, one of the closest people to the Prime Minister of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the question we are all asking is: what should we do? What can we do from a European point of view? Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the European Union has a clear direction, set out in the road map, which is also the result of the efforts of the Europeans, the Americans, the United Nations and the Russian Federation. We shall defend it from the beginning to the end and we will not be in agreement with anybody who does not defend it from the beginning to the end. We do, and, therefore, anything we are able or wish to contribute at this point, we will contribute within the framework of that road map. What could we do to speed up this process in the short and medium term? I believe that in the short term we should work on four areas, with a view to ratifying them and implementing them at the next Council of Ministers in March, and certainly at the March European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is security. The European Union has the will and has a plan and an approach to help the Palestinian Authority to improve its situation in terms of policing; so that it can carry out its duties in a serious and rigorous manner, in accordance with law and order, and combating terrorism. We are prepared to do so. We have a plan for doing so, we have the people to do it and we have the will to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reforms. The European Union is going to help the Palestinian Authority in every way it can to ensure that the process of reform which has begun is carried through to its conclusion. The leaders of the Palestinian Authority have our absolute assurance that, if they want to progress towards reform, we will always stand by them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, actions of an economic nature. Commissioner Patten will talk about this in more detail, but, in any event, you must be aware that we are prepared to continue helping to ensure that, from an economic point of view, this peace process does not have to suffer from a lack of resources from the European Union. We must also say clearly, however, that the European citizens, who pay taxes in Europe, cannot be paying out money permanently if the operations being funded do not lead to the desired objective, which is peace. And I would like to point out that, if the process of disengagement from Gaza is aimed solely and exclusively at Gaza, the citizens and leaders of Israel must be in no doubt that they cannot count on the European Union's money. The Gaza process must be part of a longer process, a process that truly leads to two States, which is the fundamental objective of the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, and finally, I believe we must work seriously on the electoral process. We must help to establish an electoral process in the Territories which the Palestinians can lead; to establish an electoral commission which is reliable and which has the trust of the people, so that the electoral process can create a leadership – the leadership the Palestinian citizens want – which can lead that country towards its ultimate dream, a dream many of us share, the dream of two States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said this in relation to the short term, Mr President. Can we continue with just a gradual, step-by-step method, or has the time come to do more? Or has the time come to take a greater leap, to play a much more courageous role, if that is possible, but one which leads much more quickly to a definitive solution? We believe it has, that the step-by-step approach, the small step by small step approach, is surely about to come to an end, and that, within the context of the road map, progress can be made, or made more quickly, if the political will is there. We have that will and, once the elections have taken place in the United States of America, we will try to continue working with them, with our Russian friends and with our friends in the United Nations, to see whether it is possible to speed up the road map, so that this slowness which leads to suffering and frustration – and nothing positive for the Palestinians, nor for the Israelis, nor for the region, nor for us or our societies – comes to an end and much quicker progress genuinely begins and leads us to what we all dream of, which is – as I have said before – the two States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked a lot about the two States, but we have never defined the form the Palestinian State should take, what borders it should have. All of these issues remain open and have not been closed. I would like to say once again that, from the European Union’s point of view, some of the elements of the final debate on these parameters are clear to us. We believe the borders of this Palestinian State must be the 1967 borders. We state this very clearly, we said it on Monday at the meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers, we have said it through the European Council and we are repeating it today formally in this House. And, on the basis of those 1967 borders, the two parties must negotiate any exchanges of territory they consider necessary. But that must be the basis for the negotiation and progress must be made on that basis – and I hope we can do so before the end of the year – and we must find a way to make more direct and rapid progress towards defining the final parameters, which can make this dream shared by so many people a reality and lead to a political process that contradicts some of the statements made over recent days by responsible and respectable people on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Having spoken, as we have in recent days, to the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, I would like to point out that they all have the same feeling that, without knowing exactly where we are going, nor what the borders of the new Palestinian State are, nor when that leap forward is going to happen, the stability of their own countries is to a certain degree in jeopardy. Jordan is essentially a country whose borders are yet to be defined, which does yet know who its neighbour is going to be and which wants to know, and has the right to know, what the borders of its new neighbour, the Palestinian State, are going to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the situation – as I have said – is sad and frustrating for those who have dedicated so many hours of their lives to trying to find a path to peace. It is important that a solution is found, because the whole of the Middle East – not just the peace process, but the whole of the Middle East – has been plunged into a profound crisis and we all want to get out of it. But we will probably have to do this by means of a faster and more effective peace process, with more involvement by the international community and by the fundamental players, which are Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have little more to say to you this afternoon, but I would like to say from the bottom of my heart that we will continue working between now and the next Council of Ministers to see whether we can implement a small plan which, within the context of the road map, can speed up the process in the way I have described to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the sadness, frustration, and at the same time emotion, that all these issues bring to anybody who discusses them – including all of you – I would say to you once again that we shall continue to work day and night to achieve that objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have lost count of the number of debates on this subject there have been since I took office. On a sensitive issue like this, it is only natural that our exchanges have sometimes been a little difficult. I hope that they have been of some use. I certainly hope they have not done any damage.</p>
<p class="contents">As I approach the end of my term as a Commissioner – I underline ‘as a Commissioner’ – I have started going to the theatre again. I recently saw a new interpretation by that admirable Irish playwright, Frank McGuinness, of Hecuba by Euripides. The classicists and theatregoers among you may recall that this is a bleak and bloody drama of death, hate and revenge. Perhaps all too suitably for this production, the backdrop to the stage was a tall black wall inscribed with the names of the Israelis and Palestinians who have died in the last few years – hatred, revenge and blood. It is certainly true, looking back, that despite the heroic efforts of my friend and colleague the High Representative and others we unfortunately have scant progress to report. Just the other day, as the High Representative pointed out, we saw the dreadful massacre of Israeli tourists in Egypt. Time and again one hope after another has been dashed. We had Camp David, Taba and the understandings reached there, and excellent reports from Mitchell, Tennet and Zinni, all of which were to no avail. Indeed, since Taba the sombre balance is that a total of 4 360 people have died: 1 026 Israelis and 3 334 Palestinians. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth – after which, as Gandhi said, everybody ends up blind. Innocent children for innocent children.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest initiative is Prime Minister Sharon’s proposals for unilateral disengagement in Gaza. Any steps towards withdrawal from occupied territory – albeit limited – are to be welcomed. However, there are, as the High Representative pointed out, many questions that need to be clarified, not least in the broader context of the roadmap. Although we have our reservations, this initiative does foresee the beginning of the removal of settlements – an important aspect and one in line with what we have been saying for a very long time. Therefore, we are prepared to give it a try, although we have to be clear, as the High Representative said, that the parties will factor in the five elements which the European Council has identified as being essential for the plan to work. We must insist that those points are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The scepticism that has undoubtedly surrounded this initiative has increased, as the High Representative very diplomatically said, as a result of the extraordinary remarks made recently by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff and senior adviser, which have been deeply damaging. I hope that despite such remarks the two-state solution continues to be recognised as the only hope for an end to the conflict. To be realistic, we should not expect too much – except, alas, perhaps more death and destruction – until after the US presidential elections. Even then it would be unwise to expect miracles. However, at the very least the international community should engage boldly with the Israeli Government to establish its commitment to the two-state solution, and with the Palestinians to establish their commitment to security and reform. That is the only way to end the conflict. The roadmap shows how to do it, so the challenge for the European Union is to steer the parties and others in the international community towards the roadmap. Otherwise people may come to believe that Mr Weisglass was right and that his only mistake was to let the cat out of the bag.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of my mandate, I have tried with the support of the majority of Parliament to build a reformed Palestinian Authority capable of governing Palestine in due course and of negotiating and reaching a settlement with Israel. During that period the Israeli Government has been seeking to marginalise President Arafat himself. However, at the end of the day President Arafat is still there while, unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority itself has been battered to pieces. I accept that President Arafat might be part of the problem, but he is not the only problem. What I have always been clear about is that a reformed Palestinian Authority is part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear whether, under the current internal and external circumstances, the Palestinian Authority is in much of a position to deliver on a two-state solution. The deadly combination of too little action on the Palestinian side and what has perhaps been too much action on the Israeli side, has quite successfully destroyed most of the authority that the Palestinian Authority might otherwise have had. We need to find a way to give the Palestinian Authority more political room for manoeuvre and to do this in return for cast-iron guarantees on security and reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative noted the general work that we have done to support economic development as well as institutional development and humanitarian relief in Palestine. This Union has done far more than anyone else. This Parliament has voted for and supported far more assistance than anybody else has provided. I expect that this Parliament will now start asking itself some searching questions about the continuation of assistance on the present scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one obvious point. We are the biggest supporters of the World Bank's Palestinian Development Fund. To say we are the biggest supporters is in fact an understatement. Hardly anyone else is contributing any money to it at all. We want to see that money used to lay the foundations for an economy in the Palestinian territories that can provide jobs, revenues and at least a modicum of economic growth so that people can live a better life with greater dignity, have a better chance of a job, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all entitled to question whether that money will be nugatory expenditure, and whether any expenditure will be worthwhile unless we can obtain certain guarantees from Israel on its withdrawal from Gaza, on the way that is going to be handled, and on Gaza's medium- and long-term prospects. I am sure Parliament would not want to feel that we were simply footing the bill for the consequences of whatever the Israeli Defence Forces did.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to make it clear that our role – the role we want to play in helping to support reconstruction – must be dependent on a real political dialogue with the Israeli authorities. Otherwise the money will simply be wasted, in the same way that too much of what we have done already has been wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that, working on the basis of the report by the Council on Foreign Relations, working on the basis of the work initiated by Mr Rocard and his colleagues on that Council, we have done more than anyone else to put in place reformed institutions in Palestine. I salute the work of people like Mr Salam Fayyad, who has bravely tried to ensure that Palestine has a decent and transparent government. It must be said, however, that without political progress, without an improvement in the security situation and without a more effective dialogue with Israel, it is going to be incredibly difficult to continue to justify that sort of help and that sort of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no more important problem facing the international community than this one, not only because of the bloodshed that it continues to produce, unresolved, but also because of the damage it does to the relationship between the West and the Islamic world. Nobody should be in any doubt at all about the impact of the struggle between Israel and Palestine and about the impact that it has on attitudes in the Islamic world. We must work even harder to try to shape the parameters of a solution to this bloody conflict. If we do not succeed in that then to return to what is – I think – the last line of Euripedes’ Hecuba: ‘fate compels and none can resist’. Bloodshed after bloodshed after bloodshed, revenge after revenge after revenge, unless people in Washington, in Europe and, above all, in Israel and Palestine, have the political courage to try to deliver what their people deserve and what the whole world requires.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The occasion for today’s debate is, as is invariable in the case of matters of topical and urgent importance, an escalation of violence. Rarely do we have good news to announce about the Middle East; on the contrary, the situation is often a very grave one. Hamas rockets landing on Israeli towns, excessive military actions and then the attack in Taba, in Taba of all places, a place associated with so many peace agreements, peace negotiations and concepts of peace. In Israel’s neighbour, Egypt, a new dimension of terror waged against innocent civilians, Europeans, Egyptians and Israelis, brings home to us the whole tragedy of the situation, and so I agree with what Mr Solana has had to say here today, that the road map is still the only way ahead. Mr Sharon, the Prime Minister, spoke about this on Monday in the Knesset, and I believe that we Europeans should also insist on that; it is this position that unites the Council, the Commission and Parliament. And the road map means a two-state solution, ultimately a Palestinian state and an Israeli state.</p>
<p class="contents">What must now happen in the coming weeks? I am very grateful to Mr Solana for having, today, reminded us in very clear terms of Arafat’s responsibility; for reminding us that the Prime Minister must now be able to function independently; that the security forces, too, must be taken out of Mr Arafat’s control and made subject to an independent police authority, with all the powers needed to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">You then had something to say about money and economic cooperation. In recent years, we have gained the impression that the more the situation escalated, the more money Europe gave, in order to try and bring about social stability. It would be a good thing, though, for the police forces to be reformed and for Europe to then provide more funds for reconstruction, so that it becomes clear to the people on the ground that where peace is, there is also aid from Europe, but that it is not unconditional and not at any cost.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, our group endorses the courses of action you have outlined, and we wish you much success in carrying them out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, they ask, do we as Europeans actually have to do with the topic? The sense of not being involved is something I frequently experience when I meet visitors who have come to listen to debates in this House. ‘What business is that of ours, actually?’ Let me pick up on something that Commissioner Patten said, that, if peace in the Middle East is unattainable or hard to achieve, it is, in the long term, our own security that is also increasingly destabilised as a result of the increasing radicalisation of people which is associated with the failure to achieve peace. There is a causal connection between this regional conflict and worldwide radicalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we Europeans are directly affected, and that is why we are part of the road map, to which – as everyone has said – there can be no alternative. It is good that the Prime Minister of Israel, in his statement on Monday, gave his backing to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, you referred to Hecuba. Rather than delve so deeply into the world of drama, I just want to quote a sentence that I cannot get out of my head about terrorism and torture. It is this: ‘At the end of any series of cruel acts, their source no longer matters; we just want them to stop.’ That is how many of the people affected feel, and it is understandable, but it is not enough. That statement is inadequate, for those who commit the acts of cruelty need to be shown where the limits are. Those who understand only the language of violence – and they are present on both sides – need to be isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true to say that the reform of the security forces is tied together with this phenomenon. Reforming the security forces and the police means playing a part in ensuring that the scope available to the men of violence for their activities is limited. The radicals can, above all, be kept in check by working hand in hand with the moderates. That Egypt and other moderate Arab states have offered to cooperate with Israel in bringing about a ceasefire is a good sign, but it is an offer that the Israeli side must accept. There must then be a dialogue between equals, rather than exclusive negotiations in which mutual dialogue is abandoned when demands are made and not met.</p>
<p class="contents">We, then, as Europeans, need the courage to encourage and openly back those in the region who are prepared to commence dialogue with one another, without preconditions if at all possible. That is the substantial contribution that we Europeans can and must make. It also involves committing ourselves to the two-state model. Let me add at this point that the two-state model cannot be a matter of withdrawal from the West Bank and nothing more. The viability of the second state must also be guaranteed, and Mr Laschet is right to say that that requires that funds be mobilised for reconstruction, and we must commit ourselves to that, for it is in the interests of our own security to do so.</p>

Arafat is there in his headquarters – old, isolated, in poor health and unable to lead his people. Sharon fails again and again in his plan to withdraw from Gaza. He appears to have lost touch with both his party and the electorate. The question is that of whether he is the man who can lead Israel to peace. I do not believe he is.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of the Gaza plan is now extremely uncertain, and violence in the area appears to be increasing. It is worse than it has been for a very long time. I do not believe that these gentlemen can bring about lasting peace in the Middle East. They cannot put an end to the killing. They cannot put an end to the violence and the acts of terrorism, and they cannot bring about what all of us in this House want to see: two states living peacefully side by side and with respect for one another.</p>
<p class="contents">This conflict has gone on for so many decades and has involved so much suffering, for the Palestinian people, of course, but also for the Israeli people, who live in constant fear of acts of terrorism and of suicide bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made so many plans, had so many conferences and meetings and held so many debates in this House, but nothing happens. We must consider having a practical international presence in the region that can supervise the withdrawal from Gaza and perhaps also remain there in the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the American presidential election, and no matter who wins, the EU and the United States must sit down and formulate a common strategy, based perhaps upon the road map, in which they talk the same language and give out the same signals to these two leaders. The whole world stands to gain from peace in the Middle East, and it is also an important part of the fight against international terrorism.</p>

<p class="contents">The judgment of the International Court of Justice on the separation wall built by Israel, the refusal of that country to comply with it, the feeling in diplomatic circles that the Quartet’s road map is on the brink of failure and the protests from Palestinian groups at the corruption in Gaza are just some examples of these steps backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is clear that we cannot separate the delicate situation in Palestine and Israel from the international context and the dreadful consequences of the absurd way the United States and some of its European allies are dealing with terrorism at international level, an approach which I believe is providing more fuel for the fanaticism of Al Qaeda every day. For all these reasons, the European Union must adopt a much more determined attitude with regard to what is happening in the Middle East. I have two proposals: to pursue and support the proposal to provide all the resources necessary to create a normal and transparent election process in Palestine so that Sharon can no longer use the argument that there is no legitimate and valid interlocutor on the Palestinian side, but also, in view of the insulting disregard Sharon has shown not only for human rights but also for international law, rather than continuing to export arms to Israel – as no small number of European countries have been doing over recent years, of which I would mention Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, amongst others – I believe the time has come for the European Union to take much more determined measures in order to put pressure on the current Israeli Government, and I would not rule out the possibility of cancelling the association agreement.</p>

<p class="contents">The results, once again, have been tragic, with dozens of Palestinians, mainly civilians and children, killed or injured. I am truly saddened by the fact that, despite the global outcry, the Israeli Government persists in this undeclared war and bloodshed. What we see unfolding before the eyes of the whole world are crimes against humanity. The European Parliament too should call on the Israeli Government to stop at once the attacks on and the murder of civilians in the Gaza Strip, to stop building the wall, the sole objective of which is to isolate the Palestinians, to stop tearing down homes and to comply with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. At the same time, we should also denounce in the strongest possible terms the rocket attacks and bombings in Egypt last week, which resulted in the death of numerous Israeli and Egyptian civilians, because the last thing that did was to help the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also call on both sides to apply the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like, on behalf of my group, to express our undivided support for the Palestinian people, who continue to resist and fight for their independence, and for the forces for peace in Israel acting to put an end to the bloodshed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, the Palestinian politician, Mustafa Barghouti, wrote that – and I quote – ‘the silent majority of the Palestinian people do not identify with the terrorists or with the Palestinian authority’. Looking towards the crucial local elections in December, Barghouti urges Europe, once and for all, to give firm support to the democratic forces and processes in the Palestinian regions instead of to Arafat’s gigantic apparatus of oppression. I would like to hear what the Council’s High Representative has to say in response to this insistent appeal. The Palestinian appeal is at the same time a test of the European Union’s willingness to fight terrorism effectively. Do the Council and Commission think that the conclusion of an association agreement with Syria compatible with this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is well enough known that the Assad regime facilitates terrorist operations against the State of Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. Yesterday, there was an article in the German press – in ‘Die Welt’ to be precise – about the way in which terror has made the Israeli people a traumatised nation. A trauma expert confirms that Israel is still a country made up of survivors. It is not only for reasons of history that this should be of concern to us in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some estimates have suggested that at least half of the hundreds of the Palestinians killed have been civilians. The actions of the Israeli army are simply disproportionate and this is a view that is shared by Kofi Annan, the EU foreign ministers and many more.</p>
<p class="contents">I cautiously welcome Prime Minister Sharon's announced intention of complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, but there are a number of conditions that must be met in the context of future Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. This withdrawal must take place in the context of the Quartet's roadmap agreement. It must be a step in a two–state solution. It must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank. There must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority. Israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is simply this: the roadmap remains the mostly likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israel–Palestine conflict. The members of the international Quartet, namely the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, are all committed to this roadmap plan. However, the current cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and this is taking the parties even further away from a negotiated settlement. The most important step is for both sides to desist from further acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Leadership is needed on both sides, and that is not easy. I am an Irish Member of the European Parliament and we in Ireland know how difficult that can be. We know only too well the cycle of violence, the tit–for–tat, the eye for an eye. But we also know only too well the enormous benefits that accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place.</p>
<p class="contents">That takes courage on both sides. I believe we should be asking both sides in this conflict to have this courage and show their leadership. It is not easy to be in a situation of leadership, it takes a lot of courage. I often feel that in this conflict, courage is not being shown. As I said, we who come from Ireland know the benefits that can accrue for the people of the Middle East if courage and leadership are shown by the people there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are certainly the right person in the right place. The subject under discussion is the situation in the Middle East, as it was a few months ago, and as it was a year ago and even 15 years ago, as Commissioner Patten pointed out earlier. Incidentally, Mr Patten has been awarded an honorary doctorate by a Polish university. Maybe the time has finally come to stop using polite diplomatic language and start using the language of hard facts. It is simply not the case that both parties to the conflict in the Middle East are equally guilty and that the truth lies somewhere in between. We are currently facing a new situation. Since early this year, Israeli towns have been struck by nearly 150 rockets manufactured locally by Hamas. Rockets of this kind have been causing material damage and spreading panic for several years, but now they are also killing people and even children. This proves that the conflict has escalated. It also proves that responsibility for the escalation must now be borne by the Palestinian side. How are we to react to this? Are we to remain passive, or can we and do we maybe even want to play at being an arbitrator and move the Israeli Government and Arafat around like figures on a chessboard? Neither of these approaches would be right. We are constantly discussing great plans and road maps. It might be more appropriate first to have a long hard look at where EU money is going. It is important to establish whether sometimes, contrary to our intentions, this money actually goes directly to those who bring death to the Middle East. This matter was already discussed by the previous European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us be generous, but let us examine what our money is being spent on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to the United Nations and the United States. Mr Solana, however, posed the question as to what is to be done in such a situation. He went on to give us the correct answer. The road map must be adhered to, as the road map also acts as a signpost for the European Union. That is all well and good, but there can be no doubt that our position should be more open and flexible, and that more should be done to adapt our policies to the changing political situation. Our policy in the Middle East should also be more nuanced. If a serious project is put forward, such as Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, it should be heartily welcomed, and not merely ‘recognised as a significant step’, to quote the Council’s communication. Thought must also be given to the steps and measures that should be taken in order to support this project. If there is a desire to continue supporting Palestinian Authority, as you stated in your four-point programme, consideration must be given to a point mentioned a moment ago. I refer to the fact that having seen some of our money wasted, it is important to ensure that the money we are spending to support the stabilisation of Palestinian Authority is not wasted again. In other words appropriate control mechanisms are needed to manage this aid effectively. In my opinion, Mr Solana, a regional approach was lacking in your speech. After all a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict will involve the entire region, the region known as the wider or greater Middle East. We have discussed this approach during previous debates on strengthening the peace and stabilisation process in Iraq, and this is also the right policy to pursue with regard to Iran and Libya. We are experiencing success both in the fight against terrorism and in measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as in the case of Libya. Unfortunately we are also experiencing setbacks, such as in the recent case of Iran. This policy must be rationalised. The Presidency has produced good work so far. It is to be hoped that it will respond to this request from the House, and that the Commission and the Secretariat will also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A cynical forecast, instrumental in justifying a wrong and illegal war. A forecast belied by the terrible picture before our eyes: despair in the Palestinian camp, growing terrorism and fundamentalism, crisis in the Palestinian Authority and fear in Israeli society, which gives Prime Minister Sharon the opportunity to unleash indiscriminate repression and to proceed undaunted with the construction of the wall.</p>
<p class="contents">The withdrawal from Gaza that has been announced has by no means been said to be paving the way for the restitution of the occupied territories of the West Bank. On the contrary, it could be the prelude, via the settlement activity which is being stepped up, to the definitive acquisition by Israel of the majority of those territories, confining the Palestinians within enclaves which have nothing to do with the sovereign state to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">The road map has not provided the tools with which to prevent the negotiation process from once more being overwhelmed by violence. The international community, and above all the Middle East Quartet, ought to draw some conclusions from all this and reflect on this fact. As for the possibility of a solution to the conflict, the Geneva negotiators, in contrast to Camp David, have demonstrated that it is possible to find dignified solutions to which both sides can agree on all the points of conflict, even on the most sensitive and thorny issues, such as the status of Jerusalem and the right to return up until the final status. The Middle East question ought, moreover, to have absolute priority in the relations between the European Union and the United States – in the hope that there will be a change in the administration there.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we can also rely on the positive role played by some Arab countries – Egypt and Jordan – and on the improvement of our relations with Syria and the normalisation of relations with Libya. Tomorrow, this state of affairs could be very different. If yesterday Europe’s security was linked to developments to the east, today it depends on the southern and south-eastern dimension. It is also for these reasons that the Middle East conflict is not something which has nothing to do with us, but is the central issue in the future of European security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Something had to happen. What the EU will, in actual fact, do is of course a matter for speculation. The fact is, the EU has not done much other than make payments and adopt statements. I would very much recommend that, firstly, attention be given to the proposal from Mr Romeva i Rueda about cancelling the cooperation agreement so that there are at least some minimum consequences of continually breaching the agreements. Secondly, I wish to support what was said just now about giving the Geneva Agreement a much clearer status on this road map. It might then be seen where the road is heading and an appeal finally made for more cogent discussion of the subject. It seems, in fact, that a terrorist is being defined as someone who kills himself. Anyone who has military helicopters and missiles is not however a terrorist, but a soldier, and it is immaterial whether very many more civilians are killed by these means than by suicide bombs. It cannot help that we continue to engage in double-speak in this connection. We must talk to Israel in the same way that we talk to other grown-up states and demand that a democratic nation be alert to these matters. The way things are now heading, we are not going to have two viable states. We shall have no viable states because Israel will die in the process, and it is therefore vital for both Israel and Palestine that we begin also to speak to the Israelis as if they could tolerate being talked to as grown-up people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Frankly, I have been listening for six years now in this Parliament to wise words, which ascribe responsibility to one side or the other for the situation, but today Palestinians continue to die, killed by an occupying army. Occupying. In fact, the truth is simple: there is no asymmetry, there is symmetry. What we see before us is an occupied country and international law being totally rejected. You should believe Sharon when he tells Winston Churchill’s descendant that he will squeeze the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank like a pastrami sandwich. Dove Weisglass is not lying when he clearly asserts that withdrawing from Gaza simply means mothballing the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not lies; this is the truth, and this is the political line that Sharon is taking. Certainly, there can be no justification for the criminal acts that the Palestinian terrorists may carry out against Israeli citizens. But can we really only make appeals? Does Europe really not have the authority to say to Israel ‘It is time to end the Israeli military occupation’?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not simplistic or ingenuous: this is the truth. I am tired of our hypocrisies, tired of this way of going on, where every day houses are being destroyed and children are being killed. Ayman, 13 years old, who was going to school with his schoolbag on and was shot dead, is the symbol of the barbarity to which an army of military occupation can stoop, just as, obviously, it is barbarous that Hamas should send Palestinian children to throw bombs at Israeli citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, though, that we have the authority and the power not just to make appeals, but to say that the Israeli military occupation must stop. Let us rather give a voice to the Palestinians and Israelis who together are fighting for peace: there are many of them!

No government anywhere can tolerate civilian fatalities killed by a deadly and implacable enemy without reserving the right to retaliate with all the means at its disposal, and the Palestinian Authority has clearly not reined in its terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">For years Hamas rockets were fortunately more like fire-crackers than bombs, but since the start of 2004, 149 high-explosive rockets have been launched from Gaza. The BBC, not renowned as a friend of Israel, has reported that 15 out of 16 of the Palestinian men killed by the IDF were known terrorist militants.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us have a common enemy in fighting international Islamist terrorism. Last week in Taba innocent Israeli holidaymakers were killed by a bomb attack which has all the hallmarks of al-Qa’ida. It must also be emphasised that Israel took great care during the operation in Gaza to provide medical and humanitarian support for all the casualties, as well as innocent Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Sharon, in spite of fierce Likud opposition, is pressing ahead with withdrawal of settlements from Gaza as a way of kick-starting the roadmap for peace in the Middle East again and bringing about a two-state solution. But I call on the Palestinian Authority to crack down on Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, otherwise Israel will be very reluctant to withdraw from the West Bank, which poses a much bigger challenge and is ultimately a much bigger prize. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been said, the overall outcome amounts to a blood bath; and, as Mr Patten said, he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the second intifada, there have been 4 350 deaths, including the deaths of 3 500 Palestinians; 33 600 houses have been destroyed; and, since the ‘Day of Penitence’ operation orchestrated by the Sharon government, 120 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed. Three Israelis are, indeed, three too many, Mr Tannock, but so too are the 120 Palestinians, and I should not have dared to mention, as you did, that two Israeli children were killed when it is known that, two days ago, a little Palestinian girl carrying a schoolbag was murdered by Israeli soldiers and finished off by an officer, who shot her in the head. I should not have dared to bring up such matters, but I do so today.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are we, the European Parliament, able to do? We would question you as to the role that the European Union can play at Quartet level. What, however, can we, as MEPs, do other than return continually in this House to the association agreements and again condemn what is indefensible in international law? What can we do? Our powerlessness is combined with anger. There are many of us who travel to Palestine. I spent half of my holidays there with Palestinian teachers dealing with the Palestinian children traumatised by the war. Here in this Parliament, we are neither an NGO nor people who sign blank cheques, for we monitor the issuing of our cheques. We cannot, however, resign ourselves to this powerlessness and to the idea that Europe would forget international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I see, though, that this hideous edifice has saved human lives by substantially reducing the number of suicide bombings, I cannot really criticise Israel for building it, but I can criticise it for the fact that the wall does not follow the recognised border. No doubt, alas, the wall must remain in place until such time as the Palestinian Autonomous Authority itself becomes willing to use its own police and security forces to arrest those who carry out these attacks. It is Mr Arafat who is standing in the way of this sort of effective reorganisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaza is another point at issue. I find it inexplicable that more Kassam rockets should be fired at Israel even after it had announced, without conditions, its military and civil withdrawal. It is evident that certain Palestinian elements are almost afraid of the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal, for, in that event, Palestinians in Gaza would at last have to get themselves organised and get stuck into rebuilding the city and its surroundings. So far, Israel has served as a reason why, with the struggle against the occupation, no real progress was made with these necessary measures. Its withdrawal should also open up a way back to implementing the road map, which is what the quartet demanded on 22 September.</p>
<p class="contents">When I see though, the way in which, in this little piece of land in Gaza, Palestinian police and security forces in their thousands are evidently incapable of preventing these Kassam rockets from being launched, I really do start to suspect that Israel is being provoked into staying put in Gaza. We must not allow this attempt to succeed, for there are, in Israel too, people who do not want withdrawal from Gaza, and these elements should not be lent support. It is in the interests of all of us that we should start as soon as possible on putting the road map into practice. All parties have signed up to it and must do what they have undertaken to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Until that happens, I would like to stress that some representatives of the Union have made statements that I do not believe to be appropriate. For example, the statement of the Middle East envoy, Mr Marc Otte, who told the <span class="italic">Financial Times Deutschland</span> that – and I quote – ‘the Israeli separation wall has a role to play’. Perhaps its role is to prevent the establishment of a viable Palestinian state?</p>
<p class="contents">Equally unacceptable to me is Point 2 of the conclusions of the Foreign Relations Council of 11 October, which I believe once again displays blatant double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Council condemn all forms of terrorism, ‘including rocket attacks on Israel’? Why, when it states that it condemns all forms of terrorism, does it not add: ‘including that which has killed more than 40 Palestinian children and injured more than 120 so far in Gaza in just 12 days’? Why does the Council state that Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, without adding that the Palestinians have exactly the same right?</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council restricts itself to condemning the disproportionate nature of Israeli military action in Gaza, why does it not use that hackneyed euphemism when referring to the Palestinians? Double standards? Ineffectiveness? Yes, in my view, yes. And I believe we have heard quite enough speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinians are still waiting. How long must they wait? They have been waiting since the Union's Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980.</p>

There is a specific question I wanted to put to you, Mr Solana, or rather, a comment I wanted to make following on from what Commissioner Patten said. I am in full agreement with what you plan to do in your four points. I regard them as well balanced and right. The only thing is, are both sides willing that we should actually be able to put these plans into effect? I agree with Mr Gahler that security must be established, but how many security facilities has Israel destroyed over recent years? Was there really willingness that the Palestinians, insofar as they so wished – and not all did – should really be responsible for security?</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to reform of the Authority, how can the Authority be reformed when the sealing of the borders is making Arafat a hero to the Palestinians? He had been less highly regarded by the Palestinians, and that is where Israel helped him out.</p>
<p class="contents">As for economic support, I will vote in favour of it in this House only when I am certain, or can at least take it for granted, that what is invested in infrastructure will not again be destroyed by Israel. This is a precondition, for the taxpayer – to whom both of you have rightly referred – cannot be expected to rebuild infrastructure only to see it destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of elections, which are necessary, and I am absolutely in favour of them. I also discussed them with the finance minister, for whom you too have high regard, whose hope it is that new young blood will join the Palestinian Authority, but who also told me that the elections must be feasible in terms of the whole infrastructure, and, here again, it is for Israel to make them possible.</p>
<p class="contents">So I fully support your programme, which I regard as good, well balanced, and right, but it needs both sides if it is to be capable of being implemented, failing which it will be as vacuous as others have been. It follows that Israel really must play a full part in it and be willing to put these things into practice. If it does, then I am in favour of our being as critical as we can be of the Palestinian Authority and as tough as possible in our dealings with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I shall begin by responding briefly to the last comments of my good friend, Mr Swoboda. The four points I have referred to undoubtedly require the participation of the two parties, not only of the Palestinian Authority – which must participate – but also of Israel. That is why we are working in that direction. But we honestly believe – to respond to the request made by Mr Menéndez del Valle a little while ago – that words are not sufficient, that we need to present initiatives, to try to act. That is what we are going to try to do. What I have presented this afternoon is a small programme – not small in terms of its breadth but in terms of its profundity – moving in the direction of our fundamental objective: bringing the road map to its conclusion and in good time, not in the next hundred years. Rest assured that we will take all the measures we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that the withdrawal from Gaza, if carried out within the context of the road map process, is something we support and which would be a good thing. It would be good if there were the law approved by the Knesset allowing withdrawal of the settlements and funding to allow the people living there to leave. Previously they were funded so that they could create settlements. If it is the case that we can achieve the approval of a law to do the opposite within two weeks, it will be a success for Gaza and for the future of the West Bank. We will see whether this is achieved within a few days. Will there be sufficient votes to do so? I believe there will, because in this case the Labour Party is going to support Prime Minister Sharon so that this law can be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist, however, that the four points I have mentioned require the contribution, support and understanding of the Palestinians and of the Israeli Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress, however, that I have talked about something else; we cannot carry on simply with a gradual process. I believe we must take a more courageous step forward and begin to define the final parameters on which the two parties must agree. To this end it is naturally essential that there be an interlocutor accepted by both parties. That is why the support we are going to give the Palestinians is so important, so that they are genuinely able, in their current circumstances, to find the formula for establishing a solid and representative Palestinian Authority which is able to act as a viable interlocutor with Israel. That is what we would call rationality.</p>
<p class="contents">The irrational approach would take a different view. I regret to say that irrationality may be winning out over rationality. Unfortunately, we have seen this on numerous occasions. We politicians must continue to support rational actions. If the people responsible for leading other countries do not unfortunately feel the same, we must seek the best way to operate in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say just three more things. The first is that I have not tried to avoid talking about the regional issue. It seemed to me that the time set aside for the debate was not sufficient to talk about all the issues of the region. There is no question that the issue of Iraq, of Iran and all the issues the honourable Member has raised are priorities on our agenda. It did not seem to me to be the day to go into them and I have not therefore done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wished to say to my good friend most respectfully that I have not made any appeal for good will. We do not belong to charitable organisations. We are politicians who want the problems to be resolved. At the end of my speech I made an appeal of a moral nature, but the rest was full of concrete, specific measures, which, if put into practice, must lead to positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to defend my personal representative and the representative of the whole of the European Union, Mr Marc Otte, and I would ask Mr Menéndez del Valle to read his comments in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if you will allow me to change subject, I believe this is the last time I will be in this House, in the European Parliament, with a good friend, Commissioner Chris Patten. We have spent five years together. Many people sitting here today thought that we were both going to be disasters, he and I, and doubly so by working together. Quite the opposite has proven to be the case, and we have shown that two plus two do not necessarily make four, but can in fact make six. For this, I believe we must thank Chris Patten for his cooperation and particularly for his intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">His good sense and his intelligence have taught us all a lesson in good practice – at least for me, Chris – and I hope that from Oxford your advice will continue to reach us across the airwaves, via the Internet, through your words, books, by whatever means, but that they continue to reach us. Thank you, Chris, for your cooperation over the last five years. We will not forget you.</p>

<p class="contents">We condemn those fuelling Israeli aggression. We condemn the USA for backing and arming the Israeli Government. We condemn the ΕU, which is against the genocide of the Palestinians in word, but tolerates it in deed by putting both sides on an equal footing. Condemnation in word only is hypocrisy. The ΕU continues to provide economic support for Israel through association agreements and to arm it. Not one delegate from a Member State of the ΕU went to the Hague Tribunal to testify on the Israeli wall.
