<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like, on behalf of the committee, to move at least one of the oral questions. First of all, I sympathise with the Commissioner's desire to get better implementation of European Union law. That is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to quote from an article in the United Kingdom <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> this last Sunday. The opening paragraph is "The European Commission has told Britain that it will lose up to 200 million pounds in grants for poorer regions unless it implements European Union laws to protect birds and their habitats". I would like to know if the Commission is making these threats and, if it is, whether it feels that it has an entitlement to do so. That is a question which my German colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up. The Environment Committee is very interested in finding ways of incorporating environmental considerations into other policies. The question is: is this a constitutionally viable way of doing that?</p>
<p class="contents">What we are exploring here tonight in this crowded House is the question of linkage. Linkage, in other words, using the threat of the withdrawal or withholding of funds to try to get better implementation of legislation in what may sometimes be a rather unconnected sector but in this case is quite a closely connected sector, is one that from time to time European Members of Parliament look at and then veer away from when they realise that it might affect the regions that they represent. That is something which we find reflected in the views not only of some of the German Members here tonight but also in some of my British colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask to what extent the European Commission is prepared to use the provisions of Articles 12 and 41 of the general regulation on the structural funds to delay granting money where there is inadequate information on the impact of the projects which have applied for the money on the environment. At its worst, we want to avoid the possibility that the aims of the structural funds and the European Union's concern to protect its natural habitats may collide.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, you may want to build a motorway across one part of the European Union in order to spend structural fund money and bring jobs to that part of the Union, but should you not be careful if that motorway is being driven through what should have been designated a protected site by the national government? Such possibilities have arisen in the past, especially in relation to major infrastructure projects. We want to avoid that, but we believe that such collisions could result form the failure of the Member States to implement the habitats directive and the birds directive also, and in particular to submit to the Commission by as early as June 1995 a list of sites potentially of Community importance, either as hosting natural habitat types or representing the habitats of animal and plant species of Community importance. We must ask: without such information, how can the Commission be certain that structural fund projects, which are usually large, will not damage sites potentially of European Union-wide importance?</p>
<p class="contents">Future generations will not forgive us if we allow irreplaceable habitats to be destroyed, whose preservation we actually voted for eight years ago when we adopted our report on the habitats directive and then again in 1997 with the changes to the annex of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The fault lies with those Member States which have failed to observe the directive, and that includes my own. If doubt hangs over their entitlement to structural funds, that is the fault of national governments. That doubt has now fallen over the position of the United Kingdom and its entitlement to Structural Funds because the United Kingdom government has not fully implemented or complied with the provisions of the habitats directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the power of the United Kingdom government, the German government and other national governments to remove that threat by complying with the habitats and birds directive. In the United Kingdom, structural funding for counties such as Cornwall, which I represent and which has recently been granted Objective 1 status, faces a twin threat from government indolence on this directive and from government incompetence and meanness. Even if the European Commission uses its best efforts in the United Kingdom there is no guarantee that the scrooge-like United Kingdom Chancellor will find matching funding.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, to begin let me say the following: the FFH directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in Europe for the protection of nature, the environment and birds. I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this. I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, in the case of the FFH directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and I can see obvious weak points. As I see it, the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions. I see a problem in the various legal interpretations in the Member States due to the partially unclear definitions in the EU legislation, whilst, on the other hand, there is a lack of strong subsidiary aspects and approaches. Revision of the FFH directive, including the current difficulties in implementation, should not, I think be excluded. Alongside this general criticism of the FFH directive, however, I also see a particular problem with the amalgamation of the EU environmental and structural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 12 of the structural funds regulation adopted on 21 June 1999 provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of violations in the following areas: implementation of environmental legislation, breaches of public contracts and failure to observe equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the Commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the FFH directive. Does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas? In my opinion, this is a very problematic course of action. The EU has a quite different means of enforcing sanctions, i.e. the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible cutting or withholding of money from the Structural Fund is a form of sanction whose effect on the regions concerned cannot just be disregarded. What will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen, above all, in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the Structural Fund? What sanctions will the Commission then impose for non-implementation of EU environment law? That the Commission is also totally unsure is shown by the fact that it initially wanted to include the entire state in the sanctions, then only a region, as you pointed out to Environment Minister Trittin, Commissioner. I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, I am more interested in protected areas for delegates, but that is another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question to you, Commissioner, has another purpose. I would have liked to hear your answer first, but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate. We are discussing something here of which most know the history. The fauna-flora-habitats legislation should have been implemented by 1994 – it is now the year 2000. The European Union list of the relevant nature conservation sites should have been ready in 1998 – it is now the year 2000. The Member States should have notified the Commission of their sites by 1995 – it is now the year 2000. Many Member States, including my own, did not do as required. Germany, for example, implemented the legislation in 1998 instead of 1994 – only four years late. But what does it matter?!</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the European Union list is obviously not ready. And how could it be? Many Member States and many regions have not announced their sites. Now Mr Schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the fauna-flora-habitats directive. Perhaps, Mr Schnellhardt, you are right that it wasn’t totally practical, it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t quite right. Unfortunately, however, it is not the procedure in the European Union that if you don’t like a piece of legislation you don’t bother observing it.</p>
<p class="contents">If that were the case, then there would also be areas and matters which you and I would not like. But we do have this unfortunate system in the European Union – what you call legal certainty. We do have this unfortunate system – it is what you call legislation, which has been adopted in this European Parliament with the consent of the Member States. It must be observed! It might perhaps be a bit too strict and too legalistic, but that’s the way it is: we are living in a European Union with a legal system. Mr Jarzembowski is the one who supports this most of all because he comes from Hamburg which is one of the few regions of Germany to be nominated, along with Berlin, my own area, although as city states we have it particularly easy, I think I can say with some justification.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not want to pass sentence on Mr Schnellhardt, who comes from one of the new federal states who do not have things quite so good. That is an internal German problem which we will resolve at another time and in another place in the House. Today, Mr President, we are talking about the fact that Europe is losing its countryside and about the fact that Europe must observe legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall come to my final point: Commissioner, it you do not succeed in going to the European Court of Justice and bringing to account those Member States which are not properly implementing legislation, you will lose your authority and your legitimacy. You must do it! If you think the legislation is no good, let us revise it. If you think it is sound, go to the European Court of Justice, and be quick about it!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate her for her efforts in trying to make sure that the habitats directive and associated directives are properly implemented. I wish her well.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard that some in the Commission believe that they have managed to squeeze more out of Member States in the past six months than they had in the previous six years. If that is the case then it is good news indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commissioner is riding between two horses: one seeks to protect endangered species, the other seeks to assist the poorest parts of Europe. In fact, it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Some simple questions: how long is the Commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act? Just how much must Member States do to meet her requirements? Is she really prepared to tell people such as those whom I represent in Merseyside and the North-West of England that they must lose Structural Funds because their governments have failed to comply with the habitats directive? That is the balance I suppose. Fundamentally and finally, is she prepared to compromise to find solutions, if the undertakings being given by government or the work being undertaken by governments takes longer than we would wish? For example, if a Minister goes down on his knees, cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable, is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main principle is clear: the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund should contribute to the protection and improvement of the environment in the European Union. This is confirmed in the new regulatory framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and in the Commission's related guidelines. We should remember that both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds finance important investments into environmental infrastructure such as waste water treatment facilities or waste management systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings. The general regulation on the Structural Funds states that ‘operations financed must be in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty, with instruments adopted under it and with Community policies and actions’. Contrary to the suggestion in one of the oral questions, this does not represent a new obligation on the Member States. In fact, it is based closely on the previous framework regulation on the Structural Funds for the programming period 1994-1999. The Structural Funds Regulation has been approved by the Member States and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to protection of sites under the habitats and birds directives, it is important that we do not give money to measures which adversely affect sites deserving protection – paying out money with one hand and maybe fining a Member State with the other hand. This is what we confirmed in the Commission this afternoon, and Michel Barnier will set out our decisions in a letter to the Member States in a few days. In this regard, the Commission intends to use all the possibilities offered by the new regulatory framework for the Cohesion and Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In following up the letter sent to Member States by Commissioners Wulf-Mathies and Bjerregaard on June 23 1999, the Commission will insist that, in the programming documents for the period 2000-2006, there must be a firm and irrevocable commitment guaranteeing that the programmes are consistent with the protection of sites under Natura 2000. Member States will be required to notify sites if they have not already done so within an agreed timetable, and to guarantee formally that they will not undertake action leading to the deterioration of potential Natura 2000 sites. The Commission will then use all the means at its disposal to ensure that commitments entered into the programming documents are fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It intends to monitor the situation in the Member States, including the use of on-the-spot checks. The Commission's representative in the monitoring committee for each programme will also seek to ensure that Member States' obligations with regard to Natura 2000 are fully respected. In addition, should a Member State not honour its commitment to provide the lists under the habitats and birds directives within the timeframe set in the programming documents, the Commission will take immediate action. This includes in particular excepting specific situations and with respect to the principle of proportionality – possible recourse to the provisions of the Structural or Cohesion Fund regulations in relation to the suspension of payments. Of course, all this is in addition to the ongoing infringement procedures against a number of Member States for their failure to implement these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">In summing up, what we decided in Commission today is that we will insist that Member States send us their Natura 2000 lists: they should already have been sent, as has been stated many years ago. We will use the means at our disposal to ensure that they honour the commitments that they have entered into. Without the lists neither the Member States nor the Commission can ensure that we protect important nature sites when carrying out Structural Fund operations, for the simple reason that we do not know where these sites are.</p>
<p class="contents">One more word on the habitats directive. The Commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive. The directive is intended to establish a frame of reference which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, leaves the detailed implementation to the Member States. While the Commission has no plans to revise the directive, its services are ready to provide guidance to the Member States on its implementation and we are finally starting to move on this. The only sites which the Commission takes into account under the habitats directive are those put forward by the authorities in the Member States. So-called shadow lists can only help in efforts to identify sites inside the Member States. At Community level, they can contribute to scientific reference material in the creation of inventories of natural habitats and existing species.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are now going back on that principle; you are going back to the Member States to ask them to provide the lists. They are seriously late. They have completely failed to meet the requirements of the European directives.</p>
<p class="contents">So, today, it is still not clear to us whether you intend to utilise the technical, legal and political means available to you in order to enforce European directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I can see the Member States laughing their socks off at this new position because, in the final analysis, once again they have gained a little more time and it is nature conservation which is going to suffer. From reading the various reports of the European Union, and the European Environment Agency, it is clear that environmental damage is still continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I am asking, then, is as follows: today, when accepting the draft Community support framework for Portugal, did you demand the list of protected sites under the terms of the directives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, of course, I came to the basic conclusion that projects financed by the Structural Funds should not, under any circumstances, damage the environment of the Member States and, to that end, greater consideration should be given to the environmental dimension at all levels when programming and implementing the relevant Union policies. </p>
<p class="contents">I still believe this today; our main objective must always be sustainable development, i.e. development which respects and promotes the environment. Therefore, Parliament should take this line and call on the Commission, in its vote, to implement the Structural Fund programmes in a way which takes account of Community environmental legislation, particularly with regard to directives on the preservation of natural habitats and wild birds. At the same time, however, we should avoid over-reacting. We should not suspend all the programmes or refuse to approve any of them just because we cannot guarantee that the odd regulation will be upheld. This reminds me of a Greek proverb: you cannot chop off your head just because you have tooth ache. </p>
<p class="contents">I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation. Rather, I am suggesting that we go ahead and implement the programmes and, at the same time, monitor the implementation of legislation and ensure that the Commission keeps Parliament informed. It is important to remember that very important measures and projects are financed under the Structural Funds in the most problematic countries and regions of the Union, countries and regions which desperately need help in their endeavours to develop and converge with the more developed Member States. We should also bear in mind, Mr President, that measures promoting the environment are often financed by the Structural Funds. If we were to suspend all the programmes without exception for the reason given by a number of speakers here, we would be doing our environment more harm than good.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation. I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding. I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve. You will know that in the case of the UK, at a moderation seminar, the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites. In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000. We are determined, after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government – Mrs Jackson's party – to meet our requirements in the UK, in good faith, to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with. This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution. But let us be clear. Any refusal by the Commission to approve the programme – for example, in Merseyside – thus undermining £2 billion worth of investment, or any other Objective I area, including Cornwall, involving 5 million people in the UK, would actually breach – you said this Commissioner – the well-established Commission principle of proportionality, namely the obligation to pursue the least restrictive way of ensuring compliance with EU legislation – in this case the habitats and wild bird directive. We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends. In the final analysis any breach of EU legislation must actually go the European Court of Justice. I cannot accept that such a balance means the cutting off of vital lifelines of EU funds to the poorest and neediest regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today, Commissioner Wallström, that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commissioner to take collective responsibility for ensuring that Structural Fund programmes are implemented in time. That is your responsibility as a member of the college.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should not just be an idle threat. You should carry it out if Member States do not act responsibly. I come from a Member State which benefits from European funding but I am appalled at its track record on the implementation of the wild birds directive, on the habitats directive and many other directives. We are, per capita, the worst country as regards complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">It is about time the European Commission took action and decided that if you are not willing to abide by the rules then the funding has to be cut off. If this affects my own country, then so be it. Member States have to comply with European regulations. Former commissioners wrote to the Irish Government saying: "If you do not have on your list habitat areas to be protected then when you put in your national plan how are we going to assess whether it is in compliance with European directives?" You must stick to that. If Member States are not willing to comply with the directives, cut off the funding. I would support you one hundred percent.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to demonstrate this: on the one hand, we allocate almost half of our resources to agriculture, but we nevertheless continue to fund an intensive form of farming designed to achieve high levels of productivity, whatever the cost, ignoring the support available for organic farming and extensive farming. On the other hand, we spend a third of our resources on the Structural Funds, but the projects funded under those funds are the first to contravene directives on habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal is a perfect example of what I have just been talking about, and as it is a perfect example, it merits a thorough explanation. In Portugal there is not only no definitive list of protected sites of Community importance for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network, but even though it is compulsory, there are no plans, rules or mechanisms for the management and protection of sites that have already been selected. In other words, the Portuguese sites that already form part of the Natura 2000 network are completely at the mercy of unscrupulous groups of financiers and construction companies, because of the lack of instruments to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">The most serious case is that of the tourist development that has been approved for the Abano area of the Sintra-Cascais national park, and I call on the Commission to intervene in this as a matter of urgency. In Portugal, however, it is the state itself that is currently preparing to carry out projects, some of which are being funded by the Structural Funds, for sites which have been or will be classified by the EU as part of the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, what is happening in Portugal is not unique – it is merely a good example. I therefore hope that the Commission will bring its legal authority to bear and refuse to approve any funding for the third Community support framework until Member States send in their lists for the Natura 2000 network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns. That is what the EU has signed up to in countless treaties from the Rio Earth Summit onwards. That is what Article 6 of our own EC Treaty obliges us to do – to integrate those policies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints. We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this. It will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means. At a recent plenary session, we talked a lot about coherence in EU policies. Members from all over this House were rightly emphasising how important policy coherence is, yet here we have an outstanding example of policy incoherence.

I will read the communication from the Commission very carefully, but perhaps you can help me to understand matters. Are you of the opinion that the Commission can block entire approvals for plans, or is it just payment of funds for individual projects? That was not at all clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say two or three things. Firstly, I think that Community law must be seen as a whole. Community law provides that if a Member State fails to implement legislation, or implements it incorrectly, the State will be brought to justice. You should do that! You should not try to achieve through the back door, through the non-payment of money, what you are unable to achieve through legal action and orderly process. This is something which I do not think is quite right. If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law, breaching Community law, then bring these Member States to justice! But to fail to do this in favour of the back-door approach of trying to stop the payment of money in order to indirectly force the hand of the Member States is something that I quite simply consider to be wrong and even cowardly!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside. They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions. We must not therefore, in order to achieve another objective, obstruct or abandon the original aim of supporting disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, it should not be the case that one Commissioner sets himself up as some sort of Supreme Commissioner who can then dictate to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone. But it isn’t on, Mr President, Commissioner, that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties! Here too we must watch out!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, the requirements of environmental policy are not being respected and are not being properly incorporated when programmes and projects are formulated and approved in the Member States. The problem is in fact much worse; in addition to the fact that environmental legislation is being contravened in projects and programmes which have received Community approval and funding, it is also being contravened during the implementation of projects and programmes in receipt of private or national funding. </p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to draw your attention to paragraph b and point 3 and 8 of the resolution which takes account of precisely this issue. It is absurd for EU environmental legislation not to be applied or respected for all projects in the Member States,<span class="bold"> </span>irrespective of whether they require Community or some other type of funding. We should make it quite clear to countries which contravene environmental legislation that the Commission, which is the guardian of primary and secondary Community law, will ensure that the environment is not damaged when projects are constructed. This flagrant violation of our basic environmental laws must not be allowed to continue. </p>
<p class="contents">We need, once and for all, to come out and say what is happening in the Member States, because transparency, courage and the truth are the best policy. And the truth is that the directives for the Natura 2000 network have been inadequately implemented both in my country and in other Member States. For example, despite the fact that the Maliakos Gulf and the wetlands of the Sperkhios river have been designated as conservation areas under the Natura 2000 network,<span class="bold"> </span>there are proposals to<span class="bold"> </span>bridge the Maliakos Gulf,<span class="bold"> </span>in violation of Community law,<span class="bold"> </span>despite the fact that an alternative solution could be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore insist and we call on the Commission to ensure that EU environmental legislation is properly implemented and respected in all projects and, if need be, to take recourse to the European Court, as another speaker has suggested, and propose huge fines and take a strict line.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that I support the thrust of what is before us here today and the ability of the Commission to use as a carrot-and-stick approach the Structural Funds to encourage in perhaps the most effective way recalcitrant Member States such as Ireland, to get their house in order in relation to the Natura 2000 sites.</p>
<p class="contents">No Member State has fully met the requirements of the habitats directive, for example, let alone met them within the legally-binding timetable. Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State – 12 Member States in fact – under the habitats directive at the moment. Twelve European countries are before the European Court. The wild birds directive is little better with 13 countries currently facing a legal challenge for failure to comply with the directive 20 years after it was agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">It looks as if there are six countries currently at risk for delays or rejections of proposals for the use of Structural Funds, including my own, the UK, certain German Länder, France, Sweden and Belgium. Only last December I raised this issue in the Irish Senate and cited all the various directives – mainly environmental directives – we had failed to transpose within the timetable or years after the deadline for transposition had taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Constitutional challenge is often quoted in Ireland as one of our reasons. Indeed our written constitution with protection for property rights has proved very difficult for the government to get over many of the issues in relation to designation of sites. But with the principle of proportionality well respected, proposals to use the structural funds in this regard will help countries like Ireland to focus on what they actually need to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I have proposed tomorrow two amendments to item 2 and item 3, adding a word: "to ensure that EU-funded programmes do not cause 'unauthorised' damage or destruction to actual or potential protected sites". Perhaps you will take those on board in items 2 and 3 of the motion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Vaguely formulated application criteria are also the cause of the nine-year plus delay in implementation. In my home region, a dialogue was begun prior to identification of the FFH sites. The process brought the following problems to light in particular. Small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises are experiencing a restriction in the utilisation and cultivation of arable and grazing land as a result of the directive. This means indirectly a reduction in the value of this land. In municipal areas the directive in its current form is leading to the obstruction of important infrastructure measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat of withholding Structural Funds in the event of non-implementation is an attempt by the Commission to put pressure on the Member States and is undoubtedly the wrong approach since stopping the payment of Structural Funds due to non-implementation also carries the risk that on-going projects may be jeopardised, thereby stopping or jeopardising the economic development of a region in general. Without any doubt, this cannot be in the interests of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be sensible to re-examine and revise Directive 9243 to provide more certainty and clarity. Citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect. Before notifying a site an owner must know which conservation objectives will be achieved using which measures. For this reason, I ask that you support the amendment which I have tabled jointly with Mr Schnellhardt.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not about the implementation of the habitats directive. Remember that the directive is not an effort directive, it is a result directive. This is about meeting our obligations under the Structural Funds regulation and without these lists we cannot ensure that we protect important natural sites during Structural Funds operations. That is what this is about. If for example in a country which we have discussed today there are 40 projects currently under way that would affect sites to be protected, how can we check that if we have not got the lists? It is the obligation of the Commission to ensure that these sites are protected.</p>
<p class="contents">So does this mean that we will not approve the operational programmes to answer your question? We are reasonable. We do not want to delay the process of approving the operational programmes under the Structural Funds but the programmes must include a firm commitment by the Member State that they will send us their list by a certain point in time. That is a clear timetable. If they do not do so, we will launch the procedure for suspending payments without delay. That is the decision we have taken today. To make it very clear also to Mrs Isler Beguin that means that what was written in the common letter by Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wulf-Mathies is still valid. We have to understand that this is an opportunity for us to live up to our obligations under the regulations for the Structural Funds. This will be a very important tool. Of course, we hope that this will not be necessary because the Member States will provide us with their lists. That is what we have to hope for and maybe pray for too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
