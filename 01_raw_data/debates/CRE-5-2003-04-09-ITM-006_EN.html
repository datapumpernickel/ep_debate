<p class="contents">Arjan Erkel is a volunteer doctor working with Médecins Sans Frontières and head of the MSF mission in Dagestan. On 12 August 2002, he was abducted in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. Six months on, MSF still has no news about his safety, the place where he is being held or his state of health. The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution in which it called on the Russian Government to do its utmost to ensure the early release of Dr Erkel.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Council already raised the case of Dr Erkel in its contacts with the Russian authorities? If so, what was the outcome of any consultations with the Russian authorities?

The Council also issued a statement on the abduction of Mr Erkel on 31 January of this year. The question of Mr Erkel was raised by the Greek ambassador to Moscow during his meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Mr Tsizov, on 14 January. This matter was also raised during the troika of political leaders with Russia on 16 January. The Russian authorities were called on to make every effort to secure the safe release of Mr Erkel. The same demand was reformulated during the meeting of the ministerial troika with Russia in Athens on 24 January, when the Russian side promised to examine the matter. Finally, this issue was again raised by the Greek ambassador to Moscow during another meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Mr Τsizov, on 18 March 2003, when he replied that the investigation was continuing and the Russian authorities were doing everything they could about this matter, but that at present they had no information on the fate of Mr Erkel. The Council will raise the question of the abduction of Mr Erkel during the forthcoming meeting of the Cooperation Council with Russia on 14 and 15 April, next week in other words, in the hope that his safe release can be secured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a standard reply, a cool reply. It is a reply that shows no evidence of any engagement. People talk, people communicate and no progress is made. I am chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and I am now beginning to get to know the culture and the methodology by which you have to tackle problems of this kind. I think that some energy, some engagement is really appropriate here. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition that is coming in to <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span> on a separate web site. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans want politics to make every effort to make the Russians specifically tackle this matter. The reality is that our Russian colleagues only tackle this matter as a criminal matter, as a workaday matter. I would therefore like to ask the Greek Presidency to show more engagement in the matter and to ensure that action is actually taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, any European state which respects the principles set out in Article 6(1) may apply to become a member of the Union. In other words, principles such as freedom, democracy, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The Council would remind the honourable Member that, since the European Council in Feira, countries in the stability and association process are potential candidates for accession to the European Union. Croatia, for example, applied for membership on 21 February. This European prospect was recently confirmed during the European Council in Copenhagen last December, which also reiterated the criteria of the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993, some of which are political criteria and must be met in order for a country to accede to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still too early for evaluations in connection with possible dates for starting accession negotiations with the countries of the Western Balkans. In the meantime, the stabilisation and association process remains the Union's focal point in the area. It is a long-term approach, the purpose of which is to support the reforms which are needed and which are in keeping with the European Union. The rate at which each country goes through the various stages of the process depends on its improved ability to undertake the obligations which derive from closer and closer links with the Union and from meeting the preconditions laid down by the Council in April 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council examines the progress made by each country every year and this tool is used to take decisions on how relations will develop in the future. The most recent examination at Council level was on 13 May 2002. The next examination is planned for mid-2003 and will enable progress made in the meantime by the various stabilisation and association countries to be evaluated. I should also like to say that the Council decided on 22 July 2002 that the European Union would use the same opportunity to evaluate progress made with the return of refugees and exiles.

And in this sense, the concept of refugee will no longer have any meaning between these countries or, of course, between these countries and the present 15 members of the Union. If that is how things stand, does it make sense for there to still be refugees of Greek descent in some of these countries, such as the FYROM, who cannot enter Greece? This is a sad legacy of the civil war. Sad for all of us. And yet this war ended 54 years ago. The call for their right of free entry into Greece is supported by a whole host of people of all political persuasions, as I found out for myself during meetings in Florina and elsewhere.

<p class="contents">As everyone knows, at a press conference with Mr Blair, Mr Aznar threatened Chile and Mexico by saying that, if they did not vote in favour of the coalition position in the Security Council, the progress of their agreements with the European Union could be blocked by some States.</p>

Mr President, do you know whether I will be able to table the question today? In any event, Mr President, I wish to ask whether today’s questions have been looked at, to know whether any other accusations of bad faith have been made. Because there have been and they are all legitimate. I fail to understand on what grounds the President has decided to reject my question, because when I spoke about Mr Aznar, I did so objectively and clearly: this was Mr Aznar’s clear intention in threatening Chile and Mexico, countries which, furthermore, are Spanish-speaking, which makes the situation all the more unacceptable.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Unlawful detention of Greek national at Amsterdam airport</span></p>
<p class="contents">Themistocles Koltsidopoulos, a Greek national studying at the University of Piraeus, was travelling to Scotland on a KLM flight via Amsterdam. While waiting to change aircraft at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, where he was in transit, he was unlawfully detained by the Dutch police authorities, owing to his dark skin, on a trumped up charge of forging a passport and driving licence, together with another Greek passenger – also of dark complexion – although they had numerous personal documents proving the charge to be groundless. During his unlawful detention, he was refused permission to communicate with the Greek authorities and was not allowed to contact his family to inform them that he was being held in custody. Furthermore, while being held in custody for over ten hours, he paid for his food and was returned to Greece at his own expense. Finally, the police refused to hand back his personal documents (driving licence, Greek passport, student identity card, etc.), which they had confiscated.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of Article 18 of the Treaty and the frequent recurrence of such incidents at Amsterdam airport between the Dutch police authorities and Greek nationals, as reported to the Greek passport authorities, will the Council say what measures it will take to prevent the Dutch police from abusing their 'rights' to the detriment of European citizens? What practical options are open to Mr Koltsidopoulos to mount a defence and claim compensation for the stress and any financial damage he has suffered?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, I am not at all satisfied with this reply. This has nothing to do with law and order. It has to do with freedom of movement. The authorities at Amsterdam airport persist in exercising an oppressive policy against any Greeks who have not dyed their hair blond and used contact lenses to make their eyes blue. They hold them in the forged passport section or wherever and they send them home. I have here a letter from the Royal Constabulary at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, apologising ten weeks after the event because it found two people on the same aeroplane who supposedly had forged passports. If the President-in-Office contacts the Greek prefectures, he will see that this is systematic action on the part of the Dutch authorities and I should like to ask for an intervention, given that this has to do with the free movement of persons within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anything is possible, except that at the moment I do not think that it serves any purpose or that there is any point in my saying whether or not it is possible. Of course it is possible, but no-one knows if this timetable really is feasible.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Humanitarian aid for the Saharan population</span></p>
<p class="contents">The latest report by the UN Secretary-General indicates a shortfall in food aid to the Saharan population The Commission describes the Saharan conflict as one of the so-called forgotten tragedies which call for special EU attention and the population receives ECHO humanitarian aid. Nevertheless, the Commission is considering reducing the food aid handled by a consortium of NGOs.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Human rights situation in the Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">Reports from European NGOs on the human rights situation in the Western Sahara show that Morocco has committed systematic violations of international humanitarian law from the very first days of November 1975, before Spain finally withdrew from the Western Sahara in February 1976. And even today there are still countless cases of forced disappearances in the Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the human rights violations against the Saharawi population in areas controlled by the Moroccan army, especially against Saharawi political prisoners in the El Aaiun 'black prison'?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Western Sahara dispute</span></p>
<p class="contents">After Cyprus and Palestine, the Western Sahara dispute is the longest-standing dispute still pending within the UN, and the last major decolonisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">On 30 July 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously approved resolution 1429 on the Western Sahara. It underlines the validity of the UN plan for resolving the dispute as the democratic, peaceful and lasting solution. International law demands a fair referendum, which should have been held in 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this resolution and all the previous UN resolutions on the dispute, and the fact that the Kingdom of Morocco is clearly obstructing the implementation of the appeal stage leading to the referendum,</p>
<p class="contents">What measures are being discussed within the Council with regard to the political dialogue with Morocco, to ensure that the referendum is held without further delays and with international guarantees?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: New version of the Baker plan for Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">The new version of the James Baker plan for a solution to the Western Sahara conflict, recently presented to the parties, makes provision for the holding of autonomous elections within one year, and a referendum on self-determination no later than five years after any agreement has been signed by the parties. This plan envisages two different electoral registers for the two votes. The initial elections are to be based on the list drawn up by the UN for the referendum on self-determination, but a modified list is to be imposed for the final election, which is to include the Moroccan settlers who have not been accepted by Minurso in over 10 years of identifying voters. What is the Council's position on this proposal by Mr Baker? What measures does it consider appropriate in order to respect the list drawn up by the UN?</p>

<p class="contents">While expressing my surprise and concern at the biased position expressed by the Presidency, which makes no reference whatsoever to the holding of a free, legal and impartial referendum on self-determination of the people of Western Sahara in accordance with the UN Peace Plan, I wish to ask the Council whether it intends to make representations to Morocco for the release of the Saharawi prisoners?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it intend to react to the harassment and dismissal of Saharawi NGO representatives after they agreed to be heard by Parliament’s ad hoc delegation in February 2002?</p>

<p class="contents">Has the Council had any contact with the United Nations special envoy, Mr James Baker? What is the European Council's position on the proposals by the Secretary-General's personal envoy for Western Sahara? Does the Council believe that the proposal for resolving the conflict may disregard the inalienable right of the Saharawis to self-determination?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 11 by Margot Keßler (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0196_EN.html">H-0196/03</a>):</p>

<p class="contents">On 5 March 2003 the Greek Presidency published a statement in which the EU welcomed the release of 100 Moroccan prisoners of war by the Polisario Front on 26 February. The Presidency explained that the release of these prisoners could contribute to promoting dialogue and confidence between the parties concerned and called for the immediate release of all prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Presidency’s attitude towards the sentencing to ten years’ imprisonment on 12 March in El Aaiun of the three Saharawi Salek Bazaid, member of the Forum for Truth and Justice, Moussamih Baba and Bourhil Mohamed Lamine in an unfair trial and after being inhumanely treated since their arrest?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Oil prospecting in the Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">The natural resources of the Western Sahara stand in need of special protection by reason of the conflictual situation which has characterised that territory for more than 25 years. It is stated in the conclusions of the UN's Legal Service of 29 January 2002 (document S/2002/161) on Moroccan oil prospecting in the Sahara that such activities should not be carried out. The Norwegian government has, in statements made by the deputy foreign minister Mr Vidar Helgesen, questioned the legality of the operations being conducted by the Norwegian company TGS-Nopec and forming part of the Moroccan-led activities on the continental shelf off the Western Sahara, on the grounds that they are in violation of the inalienable rights of the Saharan people to the resources existing on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council's position concerning Community oil and mining companies operating without international legal cover in the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara? Does the Council intend to take specific action on the matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Council is carefully and constantly monitoring the issue of the Western Sahara. The European Union wants a peaceful solution to the conflict as quickly as possible. The Union therefore also fully supports the efforts of the United Nations and, more particularly, of the personal envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr James Baker, to find a viable solution which is governed by a spirit of full compliance with the international legal order.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Baker submitted a proposal on 16 January 2003 for a political solution to the conflict which guarantees self-determination in accordance with Security Council Resolution No 1429 of 30 July 2002. He presented this proposal to the parties involved and the neighbouring countries during his visit to the region between 14 and 17 January 2003, following which the term of office of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara was extended twice, once until 31 March and the second time until 31 May, in order to give the parties involved time to examine the proposal and formulate their replies. The presidency of the Council of the European Union, in its contacts with the parties' delegates, including recently during the meeting of the Association Council with Morocco last February, urged them to examine Mr Baker's proposal with a favourable predisposition.</p>
<p class="contents">As noted in the report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of 16 January, the United Nations and the Security Council have been making active efforts over the last 20 years to help the parties involved find a solution to this conflict. All possible solutions have been set out to the parties involved. It is now solely up to them to show the necessary political wisdom and to take advantage of this new chance to give the population of the Western Sahara a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent statements about stepping up contacts between Morocco and Algeria and the declared will of both sides to discuss all the issues, including the issue of the Western Sahara, gives cause for hope. Given that discussions about the final settlement of the question of the Sahara are being held within the framework of the United Nations and are now at a crucial stage, the Council sees no point in taking a stand on the question of the exploitation of the natural resources of the Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the political solution to the conflict, the question of human rights is a factor of fundamental importance to the Union and a source of permanent concern to it. In an effort to divorce the humanitarian dimension of the conflict from its political dimension, insofar as that is possible, the European Union has always urged the parties involved to take measures of a humanitarian nature in order to facilitate the restoration of confidence between the people and populations affected. The Union has made repeated demarches to the parties involved for this purpose. These efforts again brought about results with the release of 100 Moroccan prisoners of war on 26 February by the Polisario Front. The European Union expressed its satisfaction following this event. However, given that approximately 1 160 prisoners of war are still being held, the Union stressed that this gesture was not enough but was a step which could also promote dialogue and trust between all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian issues linked with the conflict in the Western Sahara, including the issue of the missing persons, is also raised systematically within the framework of the political dialogue being held by the European Union within the framework of the association agreements which it has concluded with its partners in the southern Mediterranean. During the last meeting of the Association Council with Morocco in Brussels on 24 February, the Council stressed, among other things, the need for respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Western Sahara. It also called for continuing cooperation with the International Red Cross Committee in order to get to the bottom of the issue of the missing Saharawis. The Council has also repeatedly turned its attention to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1359, which urgently calls on the parties involved to clear up the issue of the missing persons and to comply with the orders of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has no information on the question of the 'black prison' of El Aaiun, nor does it have enough information to reach a conclusion about the real circumstances surrounding the arrest and conviction of Saharawi prisoners. The European Union, through the humanitarian aid agency of the European Community, is the most important donor of humanitarian aid to the Saharawi people. The honourable Members may refer to the Commission for more information about the exact amount of aid provided by the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, as you said, the Saharawis have released 100 Moroccan prisoners but the Moroccans have imprisoned three Saharawis in terrible conditions, simply appealing for respect for human rights is not enough. We need to apply pressure. As we have association and trade links with Morocco, we are in a position to apply such pressure.

In my last written question, I expressed great concern over the fact that the Council had not followed up this point.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am a little worried about the effect of your overall reply, because you said, amongst other things, that it was for the parties involved to show common sense. How does that position show respect for international legitimacy? Surely it is up to the European Union to play an important role here, particularly with regard to its partners. I am thinking in particular, of course, of Morocco, with which we have signed an association agreement. In my opinion, it would be advisable for the European Union to have a frank and critical dialogue with our partner. The association agreement which we signed with Morocco contains a very precisely worded Article 2 which is concerned with respect for human rights in Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to repeat my previous two questions. Does the European Council intend to react to the acts of harassment, in particular the measures taken to dismiss several Saharawi representatives who met an ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament over a year ago? Does the Council intend to protest against the ten-year prison sentences handed down to three Saharawis in March? Do these questions not fall within the scope of respect for human rights and Article 2 of the association agreement with Morocco? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, I can only repeat these findings and statements as far as the Council's policy is concerned. The Council is making every possible effort and it will continue to do so along the same lines, so that it can deal with these incidents, be they in the Western Sahara or in any of the other numerous places in the world.</p>

This directive introduces a definition of sexual harassment and stipulates that 'harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited'.

Such measures would prevent the situation Dolores Quiñoa found herself in. She was the victim of an assault but was then powerless against her attacker. President-in-Office of the Council, you must be aware that, in Spain, victims are defenceless against attackers like Lieutenant Iván Moriano. Such individuals can act with impunity. You must take into account, Mr President, the fact that a large number of cases of harassment go unreported because victims are ashamed and afraid, or because they fear reprisals.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, please note that the number of cases actually made public is very high, and is increasing. President-in-Office of the Council, you do have competencies on coordination and harmonisation in countries like Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, France, Italy and Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland for example, of the 60 women in the Armed Forces interviewed, 28 had been subjected to sexual harassment. In the United Kingdom military courts dealt with 192 violent crimes in the year 2000 alone. Thirty-four of these crimes were of a sexual nature.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, coordination and harmonisation are needed with a view to establishing measures to prevent sexual harassment in the Armed Forces. I urge you not to evade your responsibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one more reason for saying that the review now being carried out in the Convention, human rights and a whole series of similar matters must be finalised and studied at Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, research and development in the field of alternative energy sources is conducted and funded within the framework of the framework programme. The current framework programme was introduced under Decision 1513/2002 for the sixth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and research activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation for the period 2002-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework programme, under the thematic priority ‘sustainable development, global change and ecosystems’, provides funding for research and development of sustainable energy systems in the following sectors: clean energy, in particular renewable energy sources and their integration in the energy system, including storage, distribution and use; energy savings and energy efficiency, including those to be achieved through the use of renewable raw materials; alternative motor fuels; fuel cells, including their applications; new technologies for energy carriers, transport and storage on a European scale, in particular hydrogen technology; new and advanced concepts in renewable energy technologies with a significant future energy potential and requiring long-term research efforts; disposal of carbon dioxide associated with cleaner fossil fuel plants. A sum of EUR 810 million has been earmarked for these research activities during the framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that the sixth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community, again for 2002 to 2006, has earmarked a budget of EUR 750 million for research into controlled thermonuclear fusion, which could contribute to long-term energy supplies and consequently to the requirements of sustainable development for reliable centralised basic load electricity production.</p>
<p class="contents">Further details on research to be carried out and specific financial allocations are contained in the specific decisions establishing the programmes. Consequently, the Council, under the codecision procedure with the European Parliament, has I think provided substantial funds for research into alternative and renewable energy sources and energy savings and energy efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would have some dispute with you with regard to thermo-nuclear fusion being an alternative energy source, because it already exists. However, there are three reasons why I ask this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the State of the Union address that President George Bush gave in January of this year, he committed, and the Congress approved some time afterwards, USD 7.8 billion to be put aside over the next ten years for research into hydrogen cell-fuelled automobiles. The road map that they set out is that by the year 2025 the first cars will be in mass production, and that by 2035 they will be in widespread use across the US.</p>
<p class="contents">My second reason is, as we have seen in the recent past with the conflict in Iraq, the instability with regard to the price of oil, and the effect that it can have on the economies here in Europe that are so dependent on fossil fuels. Third is the question of our commitments to Kyoto and to a clean fuel technology, using wind, water, air and solar energy. Other alternatives can be looked at and a special fund set up to keep us up to speed with what is happening in America in that regard. Those are the reasons for my question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Council in Barcelona called for a further gradual increase of approximately 5 years in the actual average age of retirement from the job market by 2010. According to the joint employment report for 2002, all the Member States consider elderly workers to be the most important source of manpower and have started to try either to discourage early retirement or to provide incentives for people to stay in work longer and, at the same time, to create a framework which facilitates gradual retirement from active employment, thereby combining both approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">In its contribution to the spring Council on 21 March 2003, the Council included increasing the job supply and the participation of all groups and promoting a longer working life as one of its nine priorities, in order to achieve the three primary targets of the European employment strategy. The Council is waiting for the Commission to include this priority in the employment guidelines and the Commission expects to submit the employment guidelines in April 2003.</p>

I am sure he is aware of the declining age profile of European farmers. In fact one of the great threats to the continuity of agriculture is the fact that our farmers are getting older and older. On the other hand, we have an early farm retirement scheme, which is an excellent scheme but which requires farmers who qualify to totally remove themselves from their involvement in agriculture. In the context of the proposed revision or review of the early farm retirement scheme, I put it to the President-in-Office that perhaps he should consider making it possible for retiring farmers not to have to opt out totally, but to remain in partial employment, because even from a psychological point of view that is extremely important. It makes no sense to require a farmer retiring under the farm retirement scheme to opt out totally of a career in which he has spent his whole life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know, I think, how complicated situations are in which you have to try and reduce protection in the agricultural sector without causing an exodus from farming, on the one hand, and decide how to manage the question of the retirement age on the other, because the population is ageing on our continent and this is undermining the foundations of the pension system. There are various problems in relation to the employment rate, which we are also trying to increase. I referred in the form of an example to certain situations which are difficult to reconcile. You have to find the optimum balance, to put it one way. The proposal made in this respect, as I understand it, takes this approach and I am certain that the Commission could assess it and evaluate it in its proposals for the employment guidelines. These proposals will also be a major reform of the employment guidelines decided five years ago in Luxembourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regardless of the circumstances, the United Nations Security Council, in application of the Ohrid framework agreement signed in August 2001, approved Resolution 1371 on 26 September 2001. This resolution states, and I quote, that the Council ‘endorsed the efforts of member States and relevant international organisations to support the implementation of the Agreement. In that regard, it strongly supported the establishment of a multinational security presence in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to contribute to the security of observers, as requested by that country's government’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
