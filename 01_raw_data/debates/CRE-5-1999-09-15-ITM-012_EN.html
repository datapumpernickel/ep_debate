No, we do not conclude that. They did not act in the defence of public order, they did not defend human rights and they did not safeguard national security. They did not act according to principles of justice and fairness, nor did they act with respect for human rights. No, the Spanish authorities only gave one response: the violent response towards refugees, the unacceptable response, democratically unacceptable. The Spanish authorities acted against that European spirit which is the driving force behind the European Charter of Fundamental Rights which affects all of us, Members of the Council. They acted in a way which shames and embarrasses us as Europeans and democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Facts such as these once again illustrate the urgency with which we require a common policy in this area; an equitable and basically civil common policy for the control and acceptance of immigrants. For this reason, we eagerly await the Tampere Summit. We require an initiative and a commitment which affects all of us, even the most reluctant of governments, which is, unfortunately, the case with the Spanish government in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go further. We hope that any abuse and any violation of human rights will be punished, and that we do not fail to respond when the responsibility falls to us, which is currently the case. Furthermore, if the perpetrator of the violation, Members of the Council, is a democratic government, ladies and gentlemen, there is no third way or means of escape in the defence of human rights, not even by giving a reply in this Parliament. We are either in favour of human rights or, quite simply, we are against them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But we cannot forget that not only in my country but also in the rest of the European Union, in the years to come, we will continue to experience migratory pressure from nomadic groups, which is the case in Spain with the group of Romanian and Gypsy origin.</p>
<p class="contents">And faced with this pressure, which we all know will continue to increase on our borders and within our countries, we believe that it is essential that we develop a general plan to attend to these populations. A general plan in which the competences and responsibilities of the European Union are defined, as well as those of each Member State. It is absolutely necessary to co-ordinate actions to the benefit of these groups so that at all times, in all circumstances, the human rights and dignity of people are respected. But the required co-ordination can never allow any Member State of the European Union to shirk its responsibilities: neither the State nor any of the administrations into which that State is divided, which has happened in the case that has been mentioned in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore demand a response from the Council to this problem which we will face with regard to the nomadic migratory population in the whole of the European Union, a co-ordinated response of the Member States, which at the same time involves everybody taking their own responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Common EU defence policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">During the European election campaign this year, the Swedish Prime Minister, Göran Persson, said that there was no possibility of a common EU defence becoming a reality as Sweden would use its veto as soon as the question came up for discussion. Pierre Schori, then Minister for Co-operation, claimed that there was a crucial difference between what the EU meant by effective crisis management and a common defence. According to Schori, the EU does not intend to develop a common defence but simply wishes to enhance its capabilities for effective crisis management. With regard to these statements, will the Council say whether the Treaties stipulate that the EU should develop a common defence? How does the Council interpret the decision of the Cologne Summit to integrate the WEU into the European Union? Is there a place for neutral Member States within the future common foreign and security policy?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Article also states that Union policy will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council at Cologne discussed Europe’s capacity for attending to the so-called Petersberg Tasks, which are in accordance with Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, and which are humanitarian and rescue actions, peacekeeping and action by combat forces to restore peace in crisis situations, including when there is a credible military capacity. Heads of State and Government undertook to develop an effective European military capability founded on existing national, as well as bilateral and multilateral capabilities, and to strengthen the European capacity in this connection. The General Affairs Council has been given the task of drafting pre-conditions and measures required to achieve this goal. In this connection, we have to determine detailed provisions for incorporating in the Union such action on the part of the WEU that the EU needs to be able to see to its new responsibilities in respect of the Petersberg Tasks. Thus, the WEU is not integrated into the Union as such. The aim is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">As is pointed out very forcibly in the statement approved at the Cologne Summit, this strengthened capacity for effective crisis management does not change the independent solutions that Member States have regarding defence. The special nature of militarily non-aligned states is preserved. In compliance with the conclusions made at Cologne, the task we have in common is to strengthen the Union’s capacity for effective crisis management, not an arrangement for regional defence. As the European Council at Cologne confirmed, the common foreign and security policy, according to the stipulations of the TEU, includes the issue of crisis management. Under the Treaty, all Member States have the same rights and obligations. Furthermore, the third subparagraph of Article 17 (3) provides for the participation, fully and on an equal footing, of all Member States in planning and decision-taking in the WEU.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the European Council at Cologne stress that the creation of a successful European security and defence policy will require, inter alia,<span class="italic"> </span>that all Member States of the Union, including non-aligned Members, may participate fully and on an equal footing in EU operations. Let it be said that decisions taken in respect of crisis management action, especially decisions having military and defensive effects, will be taken in compliance with Article 23 of the TEU. Member States will maintain the right, in all circumstances, to decide if and when they will use their national armed forces.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was quite comprehensive, but I think you would have to be able to interpret oracles to understand what the representative of the Council really said. Is there to be a common defence policy or not? If the answer is to be interpreted as saying that there is in fact not going to be a common defence policy, then that is sensational news. It would then be extremely interesting to hear the reactions from Paris, Berlin and Madrid and many other places where the Cologne resolutions have in fact been interpreted as a further step in the direction of a common defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Or shall I interpret the answer as saying that there will in actual fact be a common defence policy? Is it really so impossible to answer the question? I do not know how many times I have taken up this question since I first came into this Parliament a few years ago and how many times I’ve tried to obtain clarification and clear interpretations from the Council about what is really going on. Because opinions within the European Union are so diverse and because interpretations of the Cologne resolutions are so totally at odds with each other in different parts of the EU, is it just not on, then, to say quite straightforwardly either “yes, we are on the way towards a common defence policy” or “no, there’s not going to be a common defence policy”?

Obviously you can state that it is a possibility which may become real for us when the EU is developed further, but in that case different decisions have to be made before anything can happen. Where the present position is concerned, it can be stated quite clearly that there are more so-called peacekeeping exercises the European Union could become involved in. These should progressively be engaged in first. As this process goes forward, we do not know exactly what will happen. At this stage, I should still not, however, be able to say that we can begin to talk about a common defence policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These have proved to be correct and have also been confirmed not only by the Council here but also by Chris Patten in the Committee hearings. He said that a common EU army would be unnecessary, extremely expensive and directly damaging to relations with the USA. Let me add that we who definitely do not want to see a common EU army and who are not members of NATO would nonetheless, in common with an overwhelming proportion of Sweden’s population, its government and the party I represent, like to see the EU taking more responsibility when it comes to Europe’s peace and security. We also recognise the Cologne resolution which says, amongst other things, that the EU must become better at organising military and civil crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Council is this: do you share my view that the way to lasting security is mainly through civil, cross-border co-operation and not through military rearmament, that is to say that we ought to follow the Monnet line and not the Maginot line?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we have to use military troops, then we have gone wrong somewhere. The whole fundamental idea behind the EU is that attempts are made to bind the people of Europe to one another in a way which guarantees peace and security throughout Europe. If we talk about the enlargement process, what we are basically saying is that we must try to bind other countries too to a peaceful Europe and in a way that guarantees that problems don’t arise in this area. I am of precisely the same view, namely that we ought, in the first place, to direct our efforts towards such measures so as to ensure that crisis situations do not arise in Europe or in our immediate neighbourhood.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also wants to participate actively in talks on them and ensure there is consistency between the future Convention and the EU instruments in this area For this, the EU countries holding the Presidency, after a call to do so expressed in the Council in October 1998, reconciled the positions of the Member States and put them to a multi-sector working party and the K.4 Committee, which is now a committee within the meaning of Article 36, at meetings in Brussels and also during talks held at Vienna. The Member States of the Union took an active part in the talks.</p>
<p class="contents">During the German presidential term, the Council confirmed the common position on the proposed Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 1999. In the future, we shall have other joint positions confirmed, depending on the progress made at the talks in Vienna. Member States agree that it is desirable to avoid inconsistencies between the proposed Convention and the instruments drafted in the European Union, which include, for example, joint action, as agreed on 3 December 1998, on money laundering, recognition of the means of committing an offence and benefits associated with it, tracking down criminals, freezing assets, seizure of goods and successful conviction, and joint action, as agreed on 21 December 1998, on involvement in organised criminal activity. Member States continue to reconcile their positions in talks on the proposed Convention as far as possible, and on the initiative on the part of the country holding the Presidency, and are endeavouring to reach consensus on all issues that significantly affect the interests of the Union. The Commission is fully involved in this work. The Member States of the European Union agree that it is desirable to participate in negotiations on the proposed Convention as energetically as possible, and they intend to continue to be intensely active in discussions and negotiations on this issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In June 1998, the Council established guidelines on EU policy relating to the death sentence in third countries. It is a fundamental aim of the Union that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide. To achieve this aim, the Council is urging those countries still applying the death sentence to agree to establish a moratorium on capital punishment, and is calling for compliance with minimum standards. In addition, it is inviting them to embrace international legal instruments banning the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In compliance with its guidelines, the EU proposed, as an initiative, for the first time a draft resolution on the death penalty at the 55th sitting of the Commission on Human Rights at Geneva this year. The initiative was a great success, being in content more radical than former resolutions and, in addition, there were more who were jointly proposing it – 72, in fact – than in 1998, when there were 65. The Union also organised a panel discussion at the sitting on capital punishment, in which NGOs and government representatives of different countries took part. The Council has just decided to continue with its policy to take up the subject of the death penalty in a multilateral forum, and it decided for the first time to propose a draft resolution on capital punishment during the 54th session of the UN General Assembly. The Council believes that the Union initiative will strengthen the international trend towards abolishing the death penalty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is rather the task of the Member States concerned, by virtue of Article 2(3) of the above-mentioned regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan of action accepted for the Council and the Commission in the Council of Justice and Home Affairs on 3 December 1998, which concerns the most suitable ways of implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the realisation of an area of freedom, security and justice, puts forward a proposal, one of a group of measures to be implemented within a two-year period, for a regulation for countries whose citizens do not need visas for Member States of the Union, and for countries whose citizens do. Reference is made in this respect to subparagraph i of paragraph b of Article 62(2) of the consolidated version of the EC Treaty. Only when the Commission makes proposals on this regulation can the Council, by virtue of the principle of reciprocity, make a check of those countries whose citizens do not need any kind of visa to visit EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA’s Department of Immigration and Naturalisation permits travellers from certain countries to apply for entry into the United States without a visa for a maximum of 90 days for purposes of business or tourism under the so-called visa waiver pilot programme, Visa waiver. EU Member States included in the programme are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which means that only Greece is missing from the list. Greece is not yet actively involved in the programme. However, I would like to point out that the US Foreign Minister has announced that the Attorney General has agreed that Greece should participate in the programme, but there is still preparatory work to be done before Greek citizens can enter the USA within the context of this programme. Talks are being conducted with Greece with special advisers present, with the result that Greek nationals will soon be able to participate in the Visa waiver programme, and thus this problem will no longer be on the agenda.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These requests, which are being justified in terms of political, economic and social necessity, are being examined at present in Council bodies established to formulate the EU common position at the negotiations. The Union will, however, determine its final position only after it has received further information and reports from the countries in question on the scope and consequences of the requests. Nevertheless, we must remember that the European Treaty contains undertakings, according to which Community companies based in countries that have applied for membership have the right to acquire land, including agricultural land. The Union also stressed its common position, when the negotiations on accession started on 21 March 1998, that the requests in respect of transition measures may not involve changes to Union regulations or policy or prevent them from being properly implemented. In this connection, it has to be said that a transition period in respect of land acquisition has been proposed in the chapter on the free flow of capital.

More and more rumours are being circulated these days that a deal could be struck: transitional periods, as far as the free labour market and similar are concerned in the EU, could be combined with transitional periods in the candidate countries. I regard this as being extremely problematic because it will certainly not be a question of the amalgamation of two things, rather an accession process, and I am of the opinion that there could be transitional periods with regard to accession, as there have been earlier, but that the candidate countries actually have to adopt the complete <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on accession.

The Council has, however, decided to return to the preparatory work in respect of the WTO’s third ministerial meeting in October this year, when the new round has been planned to start. The intention is therefore to decide on the Union’s overall position on this preparatory work. The Council, in its resolutions of June 1999 on preparatory work in respect of the WTO’s third ministerial meeting, clearly made reference to the President’s conclusions at the European Council at Cologne on 3 and 4 June 1999, which stated that talks on various subjects, including rulings on employment, are the most appropriate way to approach the achievement of significant and fair results for the benefit of all WTO members.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital for our prospects of bringing the world ever closer in terms of these minimum core standards - which include an end to slavery and child labour - that we start this round properly. I hope, therefore, that the Council will take on board many of the issues which have been raised in this Parliament, both in committee and in plenary regarding such measures. I hope that you will take a stronger stance and come back with a stronger answer when you have considered the full implementation of your key negotiating standards.

It is very important to be able to resolve the banana dispute before the next round of World Trade Organisation talks begin in Seattle. A decision was taken in the General Affairs Council last April in which the Commission was set the task of presenting a proposal during September that would guarantee absolutely that the Union’s new strategy in respect of the banana sector would be in compliance with WTO rulings. The banana issue was discussed last Monday in the General Affairs Council, and there was a report on the situation. The Commission has primarily tried to find a solution that would involve some sort of quota system, but it has been very difficult to move from any kind of banana quota system to consensus on the matter with the banana-producing countries and the United States, as the interests of the countries concerned are very different regarding quotas. If no agreed solution can be found, it is possible that we will end up in a situation in which a solution will only be found in a system based on tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The country holding the Presidency will apply its energy to find a solution quickly, in a way that will not cause any problems in relation to WTO rulings.

Quite frankly it seems to me that we shrink away from many of the issues just because it is the WTO. We have to have some answers from a European body as well. We have to know where you stand precisely on these issues. They are clearly issues central to the liberty and wellbeing of ordinary people around the world and they affect us directly in the products we buy. We should do more about that. We clearly also have links with ILO which have been tested here to the extreme. They have called for many of the things we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one more thing Mr President: if we want an answer to some of these things, just look at the way the WTO has reacted to the Canadians taking the asbestos ban that occurred unilaterally in France to the WTO. Asbestos is a killer dust which is killing tens of thousands of people in this Community and is going to the WTO, and we are not afraid to take that issue on.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Situation in North Korea</span></p>
<p class="contents">For many years now, the situation in North Korea has been catastrophic: the total lack of freedom and democracy has been exacerbated by a food crisis of tragic, not to say apocalyptic, proportions. According to the estimates of international organisations, between one and three million people have died in North Korea since 1995 in the wake of the chronic famine which resulted from natural causes and, more specifically, from the nature of the nationalist-communist regime in power in Pyongyang. In reaction to that situation, not only has the North Korean regime not shown the slightest inclination to initiate political and economic reforms but, on the contrary, it has imposed even harsher measures on the people of North Korea, maintaining total control on missions by expert advisers and on the food aid provided by the international community to the people of North Korea (600,000 tonnes of cereals in 1998, and 530,000 tonnes in 1999) and refusing to allow the international organisations involved to monitor the use and effectiveness of the aid. Furthermore, the menacing attitude taken by the North Korean authorities towards neighbouring democracies, especially Japan and South Korea, extends to the entire region the threat posed by this dangerous regime.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, with a view to ensuring that the people of North Korea may regain their freedom at the earliest opportunity, build a country where democracy and the rule of law hold sway and once again participate in the market economy? Does not the Council feel that, at this juncture, it has the duty to propose to the UN Security Council a plan whereby North Korea would be placed under international trusteeship?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union also believes that the difficulties in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are mainly structural and self-inflicted in nature. Taking into account the North Korean administration and, to a large extent, the speed of progress it has chosen for itself in large part, the Union is in favour of giving North Korea the opportunity to respond positively to certain undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU undertook the first round of political dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in December 1998. It is prepared for the second meeting later this year, depending on North Korea’s progress in those areas the EU sees as worrying. In this respect, the EU has appealed to the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea to comply fully with the undertakings specified in the agreement on nuclear shut-down, and sign and ratify an agreement on a total ban on nuclear testing. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would have to stop missile exercises, such as test flights, which weaken stability in the region. The Union is strongly urging North Korea to stop exporting missiles and missile technology to the world’s unstable and potentially explosive regions. The Union is also concerned about possible new missile testing. The EU is urging third countries, in its political contact with North Korea, to try to influence the country in its compliance with all these undertakings.</p>

We could parachute certain things in, as we do have the necessary military and technical resources. I would like to know if the Council is willing to study a number of steps of this type in order to overturn this literally criminal regime, so that we would not have to, as is the case for the Soviet Union, lament the tragedy 30 or 40 years later.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Situation in Kosovo</span></p>
<p class="contents">During two and a half months since the introduction of KFOR into Kosovo, not only has there been no progress in calming the situation in the region and promoting a climate of stability, security and peaceful co-existence among the populations, but the unstable situation created by the NATO bombings has been further inflamed and exacerbated. The silence maintained over the discovery of a mass grave containing the bodies of 15 Serbs murdered in mid-July in the vicinity of Gnijlane, a zone under the responsibility of American troops, raises serious questions about the role of the so-called peacekeeping force in that it has tolerated or even supported an extensive campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Serbian population of Kosovo, revealing the partiality of the international community with regard to the protection of the human rights it is supposed to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the KLA is pursuing its illegal activities without hindrance and, according to reports in the international press, organising arms and drugs trafficking and murdering innocent Serbs with impunity, what steps will the Council take to call an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council so as to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the massacre at Gnijlane, launch an overall review of the human rights situation, assess the role of KFOR in Kosovo and take firm and immediate decisions regarding the KLA as well as measures to ensure that Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic groups can remain in Kosovo?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States, which was responsible for the zone in which the grave was found, confirmed that information on its location had been given to the International Criminal Court on the day after the discovery. The International Criminal Court has been responsible for the investigation since mid-July.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can I accept the accusations relating to partiality on the part of the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. The international community is committed to full implementation of Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council for the establishment of a democratic and multicultural Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The violence and persecution that continue in Kosovo is only to be condemned. For this reason, it is very important to disarm the KLA and dismantle its military structures. The KLA must comply with the imposed deadline of 19 September.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also expressed serious concern that Serbs and non-Albanians have left Kosovo in large numbers, and it reminded everyone that Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council states that all refugees and those forced to move out of their home regions have the right to return. Everything possible should be done to try and make their return home easier.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He himself recognises the fact that everybody is fleeing Kosovo, apart from the odd few and the Albanian-speaking population. Can he tell us therefore why this proud International Force, which I call the Occupying Force, has left? Can he tell us therefore why, whilst Mr Solana himself is recording secret documentaries on NATO which prove that the KLA is involved in drug trafficking, prostitution and crime, the International Force is continuing to support the KLA, and why the International Community is continuing to arm and not disarm them as was agreed? This hypocrisy must come to an end once and for all, Mr President-in-Office. We must sober up and acknowledge the fact that the real goal was for there to be true ethnic cleansing in Kosovo just so that you could manipulate it to suit your own needs.

The European Union has agreements with Morocco with regard to economic aid and, it seems, the reason for constructing this power station is because there is Chinese aid available. That is to say that it seems that the Republic of China is prepared to offer money for the construction of a nuclear power station.</p>
<p class="contents">My specific question is whether the Council thinks that it could offer Morocco the possibility of a more rational procedure, because building a nuclear power station to produce 600 MW of electricity is “using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut” and I believe it would be preferable if our neighbours were not to do it. Can the Council not do something so that Morocco will not have to turn to this dubious Chinese technology which is currently being offered to them?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned with a specific nuclear power plant of 1400 MW which Turkey is about to establish for no apparent reason. We greatly fear that it will be used to build nuclear weapons, in the Akkuyu region, 120 kilometres east of Cyprus, in an area renowned for its seismic activity. There, three tectonic plates are adjoined and in 1917 we had an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale. Recent studies point to the fact that the Esemis fault is still active and between 1871 and 1975, more than 50 significant earthquakes were recorded, all within 130 kilometres of each other. Not too long ago, about 136 kilometres from there, we had an earthquake in Adana, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale leaving 140 dead. Another typical example is of course the recent earthquake, and we are all aware of its effects. So, notwithstanding all that, is it or is it not criminal on the part of Turkey to insist on building a station in that area? This is an issue of general importance not only for Turkey where there have been rallies taking place against the plant, but also for the whole of Greece, which is why we need direct intervention to stop this plan from going ahead.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite obvious that the safety authorities must always take account of the possibility of seismic disturbances in examining the suitability of a site and that it is necessary to see to it that structural solutions help to ensure that an earthquake would not cause problems for the plant. Obviously, we will be monitoring the situation as closely as possible to ensure that the buildings are up to the approved standard. In addition, I wish to emphasise that Turkey and Morocco are nevertheless bound by these international agreements, which is an ideal situation for proposing additional safety requirements.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
