The Union raises the question regularly in its political dialogue with third countries and is also in the front line in promoting the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which provides for the creation of national and international machinery allowing places where prisoners are held to be inspected.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to strengthen the European Union’s action in a number of third countries, the Council Working Group on Human Rights is also currently preparing a strategy for a more effective application of the guidelines on torture adopted by the Union in 2001, while analysing information about cases of torture sent in by European Union heads of mission in different parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Large amounts of money are given to non-governmental organisations and international bodies for the prevention of torture and the rehabilitation of victims through the European initiative for democracy and human rights. Last year, for example, EUR 25 million were allocated to projects of this kind under a call for proposals for 2002 and 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1994, your Parliament played an important role in the allocation of funds for victims of acts of torture from the European Union budget. I am very much aware of the keen concerns raised within your Assembly by the decision to cut the funds intended for victim rehabilitation centres.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to briefly outline the origins of the Commission’s current policy on the financing of actions against torture.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, the Commission presented a communication on human rights, which was marked by a change of direction in the matter of rehabilitation and prevention and a commitment to ‘ensure that it focuses as much as possible on prevention, including through human rights education of the police and other possible agents of torture’. The European initiative’s programming document for 2002-2004 follows on from this, stressing that financing will be redirected towards longer-term prevention activities. In a few moments, I will say a few words about how this policy has been implemented. But first of all, I would like to explain the reasons for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis on prevention does not mean that the Commission sees no value in the rehabilitation of victims, quite the contrary. The legal, social and medical assistance provided by rehabilitation centres is in our view extremely important. However, since the funds allocated to the European initiative are limited to around EUR 100 million a year to finance four major priorities in the defence of human rights, the Commission was forced to make some harsh and difficult choices. The communication it presented in 2001 clearly shows that the general principle of the European initiative’s limited budget is to concentrate on civil and political rights and presents the European Union as the architect of change in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the campaign against torture is concerned, this principle means tackling the problems at source, for example by educating police forces and prison warders, by investigating the networks where instruments of torture are sold, by awareness-raising campaigns and support where major advances like the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture are made.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, ladies and gentlemen, combating torture means taking the necessary measures to spare the victims of tomorrow. The decision to redirect the Union’s activities more and more towards prevention has been accompanied by specific measures designed to gradually reduce the dependence of rehabilitation centres on Community resources. Thus, since 2001 calls for proposals have attached great importance to the durability of projects during the evaluation process. Moreover, actions aimed at strengthening centres’ institutional capacities, in particular by developing their ability to mobilise funds, were explicitly eligible for financing in 2001 and 2002. I would also like to point out that, regardless of the Community funds available, there has never been any guarantee that particular centres will receive funding during any given year. All funding proposals are assessed by experts and given a mark using fair and transparent selection criteria. Funds are granted only to the best proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach must also be seen in the context of the vast network of rehabilitation centres in existence today. The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims is itself working with some 200 centres around the world. Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does not have the resources to cover such needs and can only support a small number of centres each year. Last year, for example, thirteen projects assisting torture victims inside and outside the Union received Community funds. This aid comes in addition to other major international sources of funding, such as the Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture set up by the United Nations, to which several Member States contribute. The Commission is currently completing work on the European initiative programme for 2004, which will give priority to the prevention of torture and to rehabilitation. This document will be presented to Parliament in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to restate that the Commission does not intend to stop overnight all funding awarded to rehabilitation centres. The call for proposals amounting to EUR 11.5 million, targeting rehabilitation centres in the European Union, which was announced on 9 August 2003, is I think evidence enough of that. That is what I wanted to say on this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with two forms of torture, which it is equally important to combat. The first works on the pretext that it is necessary to find out certain information, for example in the case of dangerous terrorism. The other form of torture quite clearly seeks to destroy and break people. Obviously we reject both forms of torture in equal measure. Unfortunately it is the case that many people think that torture is something out of the Middle Ages and a problem that in our advanced age we had overcome at the latest by the Enlightenment. It was, however, precisely the twentieth century that in a very particular way produced cruel forms of torture and the cruel torturous regimes of Communism and National Socialism, and we have to recognise that, even at the beginning of the twenty-first century, torture regrettably continues to be a reality in many parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In Latin America, torture has thankfully declined considerably since the 1970s and 1980s. In Africa, there is hardly any country where torture is not practised. In Asia, it is often precisely important European Union trading partners – who otherwise appear in pinstripes as business associates – who have perfected various forms of torture and unfortunately the issue is still relevant here in Europe. Just a few years ago there were particularly cruel cases of torture in Kosovo. Or look to the East, for example: thankfully the situation in Central Europe has improved – next to me is sitting my friend Figel from Slovakia, a human rights campaigner – and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution, but in the Member States of the Council of Europe, which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the Ill, the problem still exists. In Chechnya, for example, the Russian military is responsible for committing brutal acts of torture, and no one is talking about it. Tomorrow in the Council of Europe, they will discuss whether to introduce monitoring for Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is an exemplary democracy, while in Russia, in Chechnya, torture continues to be used. Compared with Liechtenstein, however, it is a large country, and that is why no one dares to tackle the issue. Or take Turkey, a candidate country: it is finding it very difficult to cope with the issue of torture, and yet it also belongs to the Council of Europe and has an association agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just about far-away third countries or past periods of history; it is about the reality of our foreign policy. That is why I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that the Commission is making this issue such a high priority. I welcome the fact that it is determined both to raise this issue at international level and to actively help the victims of torture, wherever they may come from – we still have a large number of traumatised torture victims with us in Europe precisely from the Balkans – and above all to work in the field of prevention. I should like to lend my strong support to this initiative. Our foreign trade policy and our human rights policy need to be joined up; the same applies to our development policy. The time of human rights clauses in our treaties being just window-dressing is over; they must also be applied and if they really are violated then of course measures must also be taken, because just complaining, just lamenting, just criticising does not do any good. Quite simply, practical, substantial steps also need to be taken and I do actually believe that a country in which torture continues to be used on a daily basis for the purpose of administering justice simply cannot be an appropriate economic partner for a democratic Europe. That is why I am in favour of a dynamic policy in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Junker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of recent events, I should like first of all to express my joy that Amina Lawal, who had been condemned to be stoned to death in Nigeria for adultery, has won her appeal and is no longer facing this threat. I believe that the European Union also had a hand in this success, because it campaigned vigorously to ensure that this horrifying act did not happen. This gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the ACP partnership, because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries. It has, of course, been pointed out that there is no doubt that in Africa too torture is practised and that we need to address it. What has happened in Nigeria can be seen as a kind of victory for humanity, and our cooperation with the ACP countries, which is, of course, very important to us in this House, contributed to it, as did the European Parliament's resolve. This shows then that our policies can achieve real results.</p>
<p class="contents">But to comment on the issue in general: the European Union's commitment to speak up for the respect of human rights and to guarantee the inviolability of human dignity is recognised the world over. We also spend considerable sums of money on this, but unfortunately it is never enough, given the misery prevailing in the world. That is why, on behalf of my group, I should like to speak in favour of ensuring in particular that reliable provision is made for both prevention and rehabilitation in the future. The world really is waiting for the European Union to continue to stand by what it has practised and to stick to its commitment, which cannot be expected from anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely the rehabilitation centres that have been mentioned here, both within the European Union, but also outside, that must be able to have confidence that their future is secure. They must not be allowed to get into a situation where they have as it were to live from hand to mouth and worry every year whether their work, which is tremendously important for the victims, will be able to be continued. I should like to stress here that it is not only about offering victims somewhere to stay, a shelter, but also quite specifically about giving them access to legal assistance and psychological treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly important for women, who are, as we know, subjected to particularly perfidious methods of torture. In Bosnia, but also in other countries, we really exposed to public attention how women are victims of rape, where rape is used as a political weapon, not only as an individual shameful act, but also as a political weapon. These women are completely broken both physically and emotionally and they need reliable support. We are called on here to offer these people real security and therefore not only to continue the European Union's policy, which must undoubtedly be welcomed, but also to develop it further. I will say it explicitly: this applies to both areas, to prevention and to rehabilitation. Some aspects clearly overlap. It is certainly right to check how cooperation is assured on an individual basis, but there should be no doubt about the European Union's commitment to providing victims of torture with a refuge here.</p>

<p class="contents">You yourself pointed out the important distinction that is currently being made between rehabilitation of the victims on the one hand, and prevention on the other. It is extremely important that we continue to take the rehabilitation of the victims to heart; yet we have reduced the appropriations for this by 45%. We should like to ask you, however, whether you can assure us that we can continue to count on the funds that are currently available. If not, we shall find ourselves in the unpleasant situation in which those involved in rehabilitation have to compete for budget resources with those working on prevention, when of course prevention, too, is an absolute necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">Systematic rape as a weapon in warfare is, sadly, a widespread practice. Also, it seems that the situation in which the police consider it normal to torture in order to extract certain information is still the order of the day, even in countries which are applying to join the European Union such as Turkey. It is unacceptable that the police consider torture a normal means to an end. I think that it is particularly good that we are also devoting attention to educating the police in this sense. Good methods, in which humanity is the primary consideration, must be our guiding principle at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention to the fact that children are being used as weapons against their parents. I am talking here about the appalling problem of child soldiers, where a child is taken away from home in order to be subsequently used as a means of oppression, as a weapon against its own mother and father.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we want to work together to prevent this kind of abomination. While this is an important tool in conflict prevention, we also want to continue to urge you not to let us lose sight of the rehabilitation of victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, nobody can deny that the real test would be to match our rhetoric with concrete acts to deal with the endless stream of torture in one of the Member States – the Kingdom of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last four years, I have raised this issue several times and nobody in this House has reacted to support my complaints. Particularly regrettable was the behaviour of our former President, Mrs Fontaine, firstly in January 2001, when I asked for a statement against the pardon of 15 police torturers who had already been sentenced in Spain. The President ordered that the speaker be cut off. That happened twice in two different sittings of this House during January 2001. And secondly, in December 2001, when I brandished a poster photograph of a tortured woman, the President reacted in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have to make sure that the European Union will speak up and act to answer any complaint on torture. It is up to the Commission to make sure that Member States comply with European law to win credibility from European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Political realism has led the European institutions to the conclusion that it is not appropriate at this stage to do anything that might endanger the political architecture of the European Union. However, I am convinced that the majority of Europeans do not share this tolerance towards torture.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought not to pretend that we are doing something serious to oppose torture so long as we do not set up a more ambitious compromise, particularly denouncing by name those responsible for torture. Unfortunately, to that extent, nothing has changed in the European Union despite a few courageous reports. We await proposals from the Commission seeking to put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that torture cannot under any circumstances be tolerated. Political and legal actions must be taken soon, because finding solutions to torture is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much support the emphasis of the Commission statement, though I generally believe that many people in the Basque country would consider that it does not go far enough to meet their concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He protests against possible acts of torture by the Spanish state. Mr President, the Spanish state will certainly be condemned if it commits any act of torture, and proceedings have already been brought in Spain against police and authorities who used torture against members of that organisation.

I believe that this is one of the most important political points, and we should not forget it. In our relations with third countries we should also name any states that practise torture. He mentioned Russia and Turkey, and I am rapporteur for Iran, but that does not stop me from saying that regrettably in Iran too torture still takes place. We address this publicly, for example in the human rights dialogue that is underway with this country. That is why, Commissioner, I think it would have been good if you not only addressed this in individual political dialogues, that is behind closed doors, but if you too had given the names of countries that are associated with torture.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, if we have evidence of torture, I think it is very important for us to withdraw privileges, for example the trade privileges enjoyed by many ACP States in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, in accordance with the precautions that we have taken in the treaties. We have mechanisms for doing this, but it does not seem to me that we are using them in respect of the 77 ACP States, except in the case of Zimbabwe, where we have taken quite modest measures.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned a further point, namely the treatment centres for torture victims. If I interpret what you said correctly, you were saying that you intended to stop funding these treatment centres. You only qualified this by saying, 'not overnight', but the policy is clear. You did also mention that there are other potential sources of funding. This is a clear indication that this is obviously your intention. I would urge you to rethink. As a matter of principle, we can only withdraw if we have information that the torture has stopped or lessened, but not without that information.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am supporting a proposal that I have heard is being tabled by the Socialist Group, namely to increase budget item B5-813 by EUR 1 million. I am also trying to enlist support for the proposal in my own group. So we are asking for the opposite of abolishing the budget item: unfortunately at the moment a further increase. I would ask the Commission to act in concert with us.</p>

We exerted the greatest possible pressure. Nonetheless, this woman will not cease to symbolise the fight of all women the length and breadth of the planet, who are fighting for protection of their fundamental freedoms and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as torture is concerned, I should like, Commissioner, to warmly congratulate you on the initiatives you have taken, especially on the prevention of torture and on the funding of rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture. Nonetheless, I trust you will allow me to philosophise a little on this issue. Two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens, Aristotle stressed that confessions extracted under torture should not be admitted. Another Greek sage and rhetorician, Antiphontas, also said that people subjected to torture only say what pleases their torturers. Naturally, our contemporary experience has taught that any confession can be extracted under torture. Victims say what the investigating magistrates want to hear and sign anything which will put a stop to the pain and torture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact, however much of a cliché it may sound, that September 11 marked an important turning point in human rights. Acts of violence and terrorism, the fear and insecurity which were once confined to certain corners of the planet became a daily reality in many other areas, including in the western world.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, a few years ago, we ran campaigns against the torture used by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes. We were certain that there was no place for torture in the western world. However, we soon realised our mistake. We realised it when we saw Afghan prisoners with masks covering their eyes and ears in gaol on the American base in Guantanamo in Cuba, under conditions which were tantamount to torture in accordance with the opinion of one expert, Maria Kalli, the Greek president of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims to whom you referred.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we were horrified to hear arguments from supposedly enlightened people maintaining that torture should be used in the fight against terrorism. In other words, we are going to re-debate what we have known to be true for 2 500 years. Nonetheless, no-one doubts that the war against terrorism produces even greater terrorism. Unfortunately, the war against terror has turned into a war against freedom, against the freedom to travel in safety, to walk in the street, to meet people and to lead a daily life without fear and terror. The most vivid and recent example of how violence generates even greater violence was the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, human rights fighters and voluntary humanitarian organisations are in the line of fire as if they themselves were terrorists. Nonetheless, Commissioner, our fight to combat violence and protect victims must not stop. From this point of view, I congratulate you on any initiatives you take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that in this chamber, and outside of it of course, we are all particularly glad about the acquittal of Amina Lawal in Nigeria. That acquittal was wanted by everyone in the world, in Europe and in the Commission – President Prodi, for example, wrote to the Nigerian authorities about it – who is concerned for respect for human rights. We do know, moreover, that when we talk of respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty is at the heart of the struggle for human rights to be respected. We have all abolished it in Europe, but unfortunately that is not the case in other parts of the world. I am therefore pleased to add my support, ladies, to what you have said on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maes raised the issue of rehabilitation or prevention, which I mentioned myself. A few minutes ago I explained the reasons why we now want to give priority to prevention. However, Mrs Maes, the European initiative does not make an absolute distinction between prevention and rehabilitation and does not dispute that rehabilitation centres can and must play a role in prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the 2002 call for proposals expressly allowed centres to devote 20% of their proposed budget to prevention-related activities. To give us food for thought on the subject, furthermore, we will shortly be beginning a study of the part played by centres in this field. Thank you, Mrs Maes, for yourself underlining – and I will tell him you did – the commitment and availability of my colleague and friend Chris Patten on this issue and many others, but especially on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to reassure Mrs Junker and Mr Galler, who spoke just now, about the support we are continuing and will continue to give to rehabilitation centres. This point is actually part of the Union’s commitments. As I pointed out, funding for rehabilitation actions is not going to disappear in the near future. You must bear in mind that, as I said, the European initiative is not the only source of support the European Union gives to victims of torture. Several Member States of the European Union in fact make an important contribution themselves, through the United Nations, to the Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture, which grants aid to rehabilitation centres on an annual basis. I wanted to make that clear in the light of the concerns you expressed just now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
