<p>(IT) </p>
<p>1. The Council believes that the decisions of the Naples Ministerial Conference in relation to the three main topics mentioned by the Honourable Member ie, the Euro-Med Assembly, the FEMIP and the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation represent a crucial step towards strengthening the Barcelona Process. The transformation in early 2004 of the Parliamentary Forum into a Euro-med Assembly will give the process enhanced visibility and transparency, thereby bringing it closer to the interests and the expectations of public opinions in the region. The reinforcement of FEMIP (Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Facility), as decided by the ECOFIN Council and endorsed at the Naples Conference, will provide further support to the private sector in the region. The setting up of the Euro-Med Foundation will foster the much needed dialogue between cultures. It will do so through a network of national networks co-ordinated by a Director assisted by a limited staff structure.</p>
<p>2. The Council will pursue its efforts to promote and strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, throughout 2004, by implementing the orientations contained in the Naples conclusions, as well as continuing work with regard to the commitments referred to in the Valencia Action Plan of April 2002. In that respect and with regard to the establishment of a free trade area in the region, the Council will do its utmost to ensure that the negotiations for an Association Agreement with Syria be completed, the Agadir Protocol be signed and ratified and that the Protocols on rules of origin to all association agreements be replaced by the pan-Euro-Mediterranean Protocol.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the reinforcement of the economic and financial dialogue, the Conference agreed that meetings of Ministers of Finance/Economic affairs should be convened in principle, every two years; furthermore, with regard to free trade in agricultural products, the Commission will propose in the first half of 2004, a precise roadmap for building on existing arrangements to achieve a higher level of progressive reciprocal liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, while negotiations aiming at further liberalisation of trade in processed agricultural products will be pursued.</p>
<p>4. Regarding services, the forthcoming Trade Ministerial meeting in 2004 will review the progress achieved in trade liberalisation in this area.</p>
<p>5. The establishment of a Framework Protocol common to all Mediterranean countries will constitute a basis to ensure coherence. Regarding regional integration, strong support will be provided to all initiatives aiming at integration at a sub-regional level on issues such as trade, infrastructure networks, and migration policies.</p>
<p>6. A Mid-term meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs will take place in Dublin on 5-6 May and will assess the state of progress of the above.</p>
<p>7. As to the Geneva Accord, the Council is of the view that such initiatives from civil society are welcome contributions to the effort to promote rapprochement, confidence building and the search for lasting peace. The Middle East Peace Process and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership are complementary.</p>
<p>8. On the occasion of its meeting in Brussels on last 12 December, the European Council welcomed initiatives from civil society on both sides, including the Geneva Peace Initiative, and declared it was ready to further assist in the efforts to promote rapprochement, confidence building and the search for a long lasting peace.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0783"></a>

<p>At the meeting of the EP Committee on Foreign Affairs of 25 November, the Italian Foreign Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, replying to a question by a Danish MEP as to whether the EU Council had at its recent meeting considered the question of political prisoners in Cuba, stated that this had not been the case since it had just discussed the matter with Colin Powell, who had indicated that the USA was studying ways of resolving the problem which it believed would also satisfy the EU. For this reason the EU was awaiting the solution to be proposed by the USA.</p>
<p>On the basis of what principle of international law is the Council empowered to intervene in Cuban internal affairs? Has the EU entrusted to the USA the question of its relations with Cuba? Has it transferred to the USA some of the responsibility for implementing its foreign policy to the USA and on the basis of what decision?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council is inclined to believe that the Honourable Parliamentarian's question seems to be based on a misunderstanding, since it is obviously confusing the answer given by Minister Frattini on the situation of political prisoners in Cuba and the answer he gave relating to the prisoners the US hold at Guantanamo Bay. As concerns the political prisoners in Cuba, the EU repeats that it has intervened various times with Cuban authorities in order to request their release and, in the meantime, to avoid ill treatment. The EU will continue to do so, monitoring the situation very closely.</p>
<p>Regarding the legal aspects contained in the question, let me remind you that the development and consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are among the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU and of the Community Policy in the sphere of Development Cooperation (Article 11, TEU; Article 177, TEC). Moreover, Cuba has signed and ratified a number of UN human rights instruments, including the Convention Against Torture (1995). The EU seeks to promote adherence to international human rights norms and standards in its relations with all third countries.</p>
<p>Finally, as concerns the more political aspects, I would like to underline that the EU establishes its policy with Cuba, as with other countries, obviously under its own responsibility and does not condition it on the approval by others. However, this does not prevent the EU assessing situations and positions together with other interested partners, such as Latin American countries or the USA, in particular in the framework of Political Dialogue meetings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0784"></a>

Thus accession in itself is the best guarantee, both for the present and the future, of the compliance by these countries with the fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law, respect of human and civil rights, and protection of minorities.

Public awareness of this environmentally sound alternative to liquid fuels such as petrol or diesel is still too low, and many believe there are still too many economic and technical limitations. The cost of retrofitting a car with an LPG system is between EUR 1 500 and EUR 2 600, depending on factors such as engine type, engine performance and number of cylinders. Some countries, such as Italy, offer financial aid to make this environmentally friendly alternative more attractive to the public.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees that alternative fuels, including natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) have several attractive features. These fuels are addressed in the November 2001 Commission communication on alternative fuels. The Commission is currently studying the potential of these fuels to provide an alternative to petrol and diesel, with the primary aims of reducing CO2 emissions and improving security of supply in the road sector.</p>
<p>Part of this work is being carried out with a stakeholder group. Their preliminary results indicate low awareness of these fuels’ benefits and that CNG seems to be fully competitive if the vehicles and fuelling equipment are produced at a comparable scale and are used to a comparable degree as with petrol and diesel. Part of the reason for their modest success is that they suffer from the higher cost of any niche product unless introduced on a large scale. Higher levels of market penetration are only likely if incentives are granted as permitted in the directive on taxation of energy products. The group will report before the end of the year and after examining the report the Commission will make the necessary proposals to continue the developpment of its strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, the transport element of the new Intelligent Energy – Europe programme, STEER, contains a Key Action which covers both CNG and LPG. Proposals under this area could cover issues such as fuel standards, norms and promotional schemes. This Key Action will be opened in the second call in 2004.</p>
<p>Finally, the Community research and technological development (RTD) programme supports research and demonstration on alternative fuels. In the 5<span class="sup">th</span> framework programme some € 50 million are spent on the first CIVITAS initiative involving 19 cities, around a third of whom are operating CNG/LPG vehicles, as well as over € 10 million RTD projects related to CNG production, development and safe use. Both fuels are also eligible within the second CIVITAS call for proposals with a similar budget which closes in December 2003. Alternative fuel activities featured in the first call of the 6<span class="sup">th</span> framework programme included an integrated project to produce hydrogen-rich gases from biomass which is still under negotiation. A later call will address demonstration activities with a higher priority.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission has received no information that enables it to establish a link between the Russian order specifying the ports in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland in which ships carrying radioactive cargos could potentially dock and the decision authorising the import into Russia of irradiated fuel or radioactive waste.</p>
<p>Shipments of radioactive waste between Member States and non-Member States are governed by Council Directive 92/3/Euratom of 3 February 1992, which specifies that shipment operations must conform to Community and national provisions as well as to international agreements concerning the transport of radioactive material. Furthermore, any obligations associated with safety control (Safeguards) must be respected.</p>
<p>As regards the route across the Baltic sea and the Gulf of Finland that ships carrying these cargos would take, neither Member States nor transporters of radioactive material are bound by Community legislation to give prior notice to the Commission regarding the schedule and routes of shipments of nuclear matter or other radioactive material.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 18 of the above-mentioned directive, however, Member States must submit regular reports to the Commission on the situation with regard to shipments of radioactive waste.</p>
<p>Ships carrying radioactive cargos participate in the ship reporting system in the Baltic Sea in accordance with locally applicable rules, which generally stipulate that the competent coastal authorities should be informed of the nature of the hazardous or pollutant cargo being shipped, including radioactive material.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the implementation, from 5 February 2004, of Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, will permit closer monitoring of ships and more effective transmission between Member States of information concerning hazardous cargos. In this context, the Commission will support in principle the initiatives of Member States of the International Maritime Organisation, aiming to bolster or establish traffic organisation and ship reporting systems in European waters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0752"></a>

<p>(EN) Biofuels, blended or pure, carry a number of environmental advantages compared to conventional transport fuels. One of these, as noted in the Honourable Member’s question, is that they cause less damage to freshwater plants, fish and animals when released into the water.</p>
<p>Through the biofuels directive<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Union has adopted the indicative target of increasing the share of biofuels share in transport fuels from less than 1% today to 5.75% in 2010. The directive applies to diesel used in inland waterway and rail transport, as well as to road transport. It is for Member States, suppliers and users to make the decisions which will determine the contribution each of these sectors will make to achieving the objective.</p>
<p>Projects to develop the use of biofuels in waterway transport are eligible for support under the Community’s Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. However, no project proposals have been received to date.</p>
<p>Concerning the conversion of small diesel engines for the use of biofuels, it should be noted that commercial products have been available for a number of years, including also dual-fuel solutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The undertaking was effectively sold to the German group Babcock Borsig AG in October 2001. In June 2002, the acquirer of the company initiated insolvency procedures and its liquidation process under an independent insolvency administrator started. It falls under the competence of this administrator to decide upon the sale of Babcock Borsig España, as a subsidiary of the group, to any interested third party. The Commission cannot interfere on the basis of the application of State Aid rules in the new sale of Babcock Borsig España by the German insolvency administrator.</p>
<p>The Spanish authorities have requested the authorisation of the Commission to continue with the payment of the aid approved in July 2001 and which was interrupted by the insolvency declaration of the mother company of the German group Babcock Borsig AG. An amended restructuring plan supported with a reduced amount of State Aid with respect to the original plan analysed by the Commission 2001 has been notified and is currently under assessment. An assessment will be made on the basis of the compatibility criteria set out in the Community Guidelines on State Aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty, which include a test on viability.

<p>(EN) Industrial/white biotechnology is very important in terms of both the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, e.g. promoting growth, competitiveness and employment, and supporting sustainable development. Consequently it should be a major beneficiary of industrial and research policy in Europe.</p>
<p>More than two years ago he Commission’s paper “Towards A Strategic Vision Of Life Sciences And Biotechnology” recognised the enormous global potential that industrial biotechnology offers.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out a series of analyses, which describe the status of white biotechnology in Europe and quantify its future potential in different sectors. An ongoing study shows that a broad variety of bio-based polymers is currently finding its way into industrial products and processes.</p>
<p>Biotechnology offers the prospect of reductions in raw material and energy consumption, as well as less pollution and recyclable and biodegradable waste, for the same level of industrial production.</p>
<p>An example of policy support is the strong emphasis of white biotechnology as a future high technology in European industry, which should be a major beneficiary of the Commission’s Strategy and Action Plan for the Life Sciences &amp; Biotechnology. The EU’s overall regulatory framework for “white” biotechnology being generally satisfactory, no systematic reform is foreseen in that area.</p>
<p>However, setting the right incentives and removing barriers for the further dissemination of white biotechnology remains a challenge for policy makers at Member States and European level. In this context the Commission has identified particular instances where there are obstacles to the diffusion of biotechnological processing into industrial use as well as measures to overcome them. With regard to research effort, internal estimates are that some hundreds of projects related to “white” biotechnology have been (or are being) financed under the 4th and 5th Framework Programmes.</p>
<p>The 6th Framework Programmes allocates more than €2 billion to research into sustainable development where industrial/“white” biotechnology can be expected to provide many of the solutions, although of course other technologies are also eligible.</p>
<p>The Commission has discussed with relevant scientific and industrial circles further policy steps which could facilitate developments.It notably intends to organise a "stakeholder workshop" early in 2004 to analyse how to promote white biotechnology using incentives for public private partnerships, such as, the EU framework programme or other European or national initiatives.</p>
<p>In conclusion: industrial/“white” biotechnology can be expected to be a major beneficiary both of EU industrial policy and of the EU’s research expenditure, and in turn be a major contributor to competitiveness and sustainable industrial development in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0733"></a>

The Commission has never financed the participation of European artists or any other kind of activity in the Havana Biennal, nor was such a financing foreseen for this year. Furthermore, it is equally misleading to say that the Union has decided to "freeze cultural relations with Cuba". The Union merely decided on 5 June 2003 to "reduce the level of participation of the Member States in cultural events". This diplomatic measure was taken as a sign of protest against the sentencing of 75 dissidents for up to 28 years in prison and the execution of three hijackers following a summary trial in April 2003.

The bank requires this before it will give letters of guarantee to OPAK, which will then deposit them with the Payment and Inspection Agency for Community Subsidies (OPEKEPE) in order to collect advance payment of the tobacco subsidy. One of the effects of the direct debit is to authorise the bank to go into the producers' accounts and deduct sums which in the bank's opinion are owed to it and to third parties. The ATE enforces this extortion by citing an agreement which it has signed with OPEKEPE, although it is inconceivable that the agreement lays down such a procedure.</p>

<p>The Commission has commissioned the following studies and surveys: Olistat, Olisig, Oliarea and Olicount, Olicount 2000, Oliarea and Geomatics, in order to obtain reliable information, as a basis for tackling the forthcoming COM in olive oil, a sector which is a key element in the Community agricultural model.</p>
<p>In 1998/99, there were approximately 4.5 million hectares under olive trees in the EU, i.e. 4% of usable agricultural, 44.5% of the total in Spain; the EU dominates world olive production, with harvests which constantly throughout the 1990s, particularly in Spain, reaching the unprecedented figure of 2.46 million tonnes of virgin olive oil in 2001/2002. Trade in olive oil has become a salient feature of the market, with exports doubling in the last 10 years to 324 000 tonnes, and particular attention was paid to control and quality, especially in 2001, with quality rules being laid down for olive sector products and their marketing.</p>
<p>Given this situation, and noting that the proposal put forward by the Commission in Communication SEC(2003)1022 involves major social threats to various Spanish regions, and that the cost of the research studies commissioned by the Commission was € 40 million, will the Commission be taking the results of these surveys into account when establishing the national allocation and supplementary payments?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Since 1998, the Commission has undertaken a great deal of work to increase understanding of the structural situation of the Community olive–growing sector. This has taken place in particular through the establishment, by the Member States, of a Geographical Information System (GIS) for olive cultivation, based on computerised data obtained from aerial photographs of olive-growing parcels and crop declarations.</p>
<p>On the same basis, the Joint Research Centre estimated, in the OLISTAT and OLIAREA studies, the number of olive trees in the Community and the total surface area of olive-growing areas respectively. The distribution of Community aid by Member State that is proposed in the draft reform conforms to these data. Spain’s share (42.5%) in relation to aid granted to olive growers during the reference period falls between the percentage of olive trees in this Member State (39.1%) and the percentage of olive-growing areas (44.5%).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission proposes that the GIS for olive cultivation be the management and control instrument for all direct support to olive growers. Thus, in the proposed system, the calculation of olive-growing areas both for determining the rights to the single payment and for new aid to olive groves will be based on the GIS for olive cultivation.</p>
<p>Finally, the honourable Member considers that the proposed reform of the system entails significant social risks for certain regions of Spain. It is specifically to avoid these risks that the Commission proposes the creation of national envelopes. These envelopes will include 40% of production aid granted to olive growers with more than 0.3 hectares during the reference period. They will be used by Member States to grant aid, the size of which may be differentiated in relation to the social or environmental interest of the olive groves concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0746"></a>

<p>(EN) As a preliminary remark, the Commission would first like to stress that the Court of Auditors Special Report on the LIFE-Programme focused in particular on the second phase of the Programme (LIFE II) covering projects funded between 1996 and 1999. The Court acknowledged that substantial improvements were made in the management of LIFE III (projects funded since 2000).</p>
<p>The Commission further wishes to point out that no national civil servants have been involved in the preparation of the LIFE-Programme.</p>
<p>The issue to which the Honourable Member is likely to refer is the result of a recent oral comment from the Court of Auditors stating that national civil servants have received an extra salary for their involvement in the implementation of LIFE-projects on top of their normal salary. It should be emphasised that the Special Report on the LIFE-programme does not contain any such observation nor does the Commission have evidence of such practice.</p>
<p>The Court of Auditors has criticised on the contrary that for LIFE-projects involving national, regional or local authorities, the relevant salary costs for staff (permanent or temporary personnel) working on the projects are considered as eligible costs. Only the actual time staff has spent working on actions foreseen in the project is considered eligible provided that clear justification and documents are available (i.e. timesheets and salary slips). The EU-contribution is paid to the authority concerned, not to individual civil servants. The current LIFE-Regulation allows this procedure, but in response to the Court’s observation, the Commission will examine the question of taking into account the salaries of national civil servants for future funding under LIFE.</p>
<p>Finally the Commission intends to point out that the officials of a national, regional or local authorities to whom refers the Honourable Member and who work in their own country for the implementation of LIFE projects, have not to be confused with Seconded National Experts (SNEs) working in the Commission services and coming from National Administrations and who are not involved in the object of the question of the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0758"></a>

<p>(EN) The fight against child trafficking, child pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children is a major priority for the Commission. In 2001 the Commission launched two proposals for framework decisions addressing the issue at stake. On 19 July 2002 the Council adopted the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings. The act includes specific provisions on children as victims of trafficking in human beings. Furthermore, in October 2002 the Council reached political agreement on the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. Unfortunately, the Council has not yet formally adopted the act. Some Member States had parliamentary reservation. Meanwhile, all but one Member State lifted their reservation.</p>
<p>The prevention of and the fight against all forms of sexual abuse of children has also been addressed through research projects co-funded from programmes such as DAPHNE, STOP and AGIS. In particular, academic experts from the Ghent University had a closer look at questions concerning a European data collection on sexual offences against minors. In the course of the project the creation of different databases has been discussed: a database on pending investigations, an Union criminal record database and a database at Europol containing information on both suspected and convicted offenders of sexual offences against children. The research team also elaborated a draft Council Decision setting up a European reference database on persons suspected of having committed, being prosecuted for or having been convicted for sexual offences against children.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to work on improving the prevention of and the fight against sexual abuse of children. Due attention will be paid to the findings of the above-mentioned study and other relevant projects. A common definition of sexual offences would also be helpful in order to develop a common position on the question whose data should appear in a Europe-wide register on sex offenders. Consequently, the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography should be adopted and implemented as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0760"></a>

<p>(EN) In the case in question, the nature of the fraud comprised two elements. The first element centred on the abuse of the excise movement system<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> whereby duty-suspended excise products are permitted to move between authorised tax warehouses in Member States, accompanied by an Accompanying Administrative Document. It is understood that this documentation was falsified to indicate that the goods had reached their intended destination whereas, in fact, the goods were diverted onto the markets of other Member States so evading the duty due to those Member States. The second element comprised the illicit distillation of alcohol in Portugal. The alcohol was the subject of clandestine production, i.e. it was not produced in authorised premises. The alcohol was then dispatched to other Member States with documentation stating the goods were something other than alcohol. Investigation by the Portuguese authorities, in collaboration with other Member States under mutual assistance arrangements, is ongoing.</p>
<p>Excise fraud in the area of alcohol (and tobacco) is a serious problem. However, it is not a new phenomenon. Since the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993 fraudsters have targeted the markets of those Member States where the rates of excise duty are high. This fraud problem has been the subject of detailed examination in the past. In 1997 the High Level Group on fraud, consisting representatives from all Member States and the Commission including the European Anti-Fraud Office, was established to analyse the scale of the problem and to devise counter-measures. Their report was approved by the ECOFIN Council on 19 May 1998. One of the main recommendations made concerned the abuse of the movement system, which was the area targeted by the fraudsters in the case mentioned above, and proposed the introduction of an electronic movement system. The development of this system was endorsed by the decision of the Parliament and the Council on 16 June 2003<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It will deliver benefits by replacing the current paper documentation, which has been the main weakness exploited by the fraudsters, with a secure computer messaging system. This messaging system will operate both between consignors and consignees and the administrations of the Member States. It will also enable checks to be made in real-time by the authorities such as the verification of the authorised status of the operators, and so on. However, that does not mean to say that further work in this area is not required or that there is room for complacency. Indeed, the Commission is actively engaged, on an ongoing basis, with the Member States to continue to examine the problems of excise fraud and to devise new counter-measures.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission will present, at the end of this year, a new proposal for a Regulation on administrative co-operation in the excise field aimed at reinforcing and simplifying the mechanisms of mutual assistance between Member States.</p>
<p>So far as checks on grape spirit distillation are concerned, in the particular case in question the production of the alcohol was a clandestine operation so uncovering fraud of this type requires a different, investigative type, approach by the Member States.</p>
<p>In relation to tax harmonisation, the view of the Commission is that a large measure of harmonisation is necessary in the excise fields to improve the functioning of the Internal Market, to avoid distortions of competition and to reduce fraud exploiting rate differentials between Member States. This applies for all excise products including alcohol.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Although it is a member of the Council of Europe, Georgia has had to rely solely on its own resources and US support, and not on the aid of the EU and its Member States, to bring about its ‘velvet revolution’.

On the contrary, it must, without further delay, learn the lessons of the latest events and recognise the great maturity shown by the Georgian people and their right to enter the EU fold at an early date. As the interim President, Ms Burdzhanadze, has said, the next few months will be vital for setting Georgia firmly on a new path. Without substantial financial aid from the international community, Georgia may not be able to benefit to the full from the new situation.</p>
<p>Does the Commission realise that Georgia’s remarkable velvet revolution has been achieved without EU support worthy of the name? Will it take the opportunity afforded by the new situation in order to bind Georgia to the EU by proposing that the country be placed on the list of candidates for accession?

<p>The Commission has backed up the Union’s political support for the interim leadership in Georgia with financial assistance: up to €2 million are being mobilised for the new elections planned for next year. The Commission is also speeding up the disbursement of €5 million of the Food Security Programme funds. It also intends, in cooperation with others, to examine how it can best support the political and economic reform programme of the new Georgian President following what it sincerely hopes will be free and fair elections on 4 January 2004. The Commission’s recently revised Country Strategy for Georgia is well adapted to the task in hand.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to strengthening its relations with the South Caucasus countries on the basis of a commitment to political and economic reform, implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and a constructive approach to regional issues.

<p>The judgment of the Court of Justice in the Müller-Fauré/Van Riet case (C-0385/99) made a clear distinction between out-patient and in-patient hospital treatment. In the report on the future of health care for which the questioner was rapporteur (12/2002 - <a href="/doceo/document/A-5-2002-0452_EN.html">A5-0452/2002</a>) the European Parliament asserted that the achievement of the objectives of sustainability, accessibility and quality of health services requires, inter alia, the creation of an internal market in health services and products, which must guarantee high quality health care accessible to, and affordable for, all, taking into account the viability and capacity of the Member States’ systems, and guaranteeing free movement of citizens and access to services in all the countries of the Union, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>How is it that the Court did not express the same views as regards hospital care? In particular, how can this be reconciled with the status of European citizens, whose right to healthcare is, as a result of that judgment, fully guaranteed only in the case of out-patient care and not for in-patient care, on the basis of purely economic considerations?

<p>(FR) As the honourable Member points out, in the Müller-Fauré/van Riet<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> judgment, the Court ruled on the issue of authorisation of reimbursement in the case of care provided in another Member State. This judgment comes after a series of other judgments given by the Court on this issue since 1998<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It should be pointed out that the Court has again ruled on this issue in the Inizan<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> case. The questions put to the Commission must be considered in light of all this case-law.</p>
<p>In these judgments, the Court recognised the right of patients to receive reimbursement in the case of medical care received in another Member State. However, the Court made this right subject to conditions intended, in particular, to guarantee the financial stability of social security and to ensure a high level of health protection. These considerations are at the heart of the distinction made by the Court between in-patient care and out-patient care.</p>
<p>As regards out-patient care, the Court recognised patients’ freedom of choice, pointing out that the requirement of prior authorisation for reimbursement was not justified and should be removed. It confirmed that, in order to avoid endangering the financial stability of the social security of the Member State of affiliation, this care should be paid for within the limits of the health insurance cover patients receive in their Member State of affiliation. Thus, the Member State of affiliation is only bound to reimburse care provided in another Member State insofar as this care is paid for by its social security system when provided on its own territory. This care is reimbursed in accordance with the tariffs applicable in the Member State of affiliation and the conditions to which the Member States subject the provision of out-patient care on their territory, such as the requirement of prior consultation by a general practitioner before consulting a specialist, remain applicable in the case of care provided in another Member State.</p>
<p>As regards in-patient care, the Court admitted that the requirement of authorisation was justified by the planning needs of Member States in order to allow them to guarantee sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of quality in-patient care on their territory and to avoid, as far as possible, any waste of technical and human resources. Thus, upholding the authorisation requirement in this case serves the interests of patients who can receive adequate treatment in their own Member State. Furthermore, the Court pointed out that if this was not the case, for example in cases where there are waiting lists on national territory to receive the care required by the patient’s state of health, which cannot be provided in due time, refusal of authorisation for treatment in another Member State would not be justified. The Court therefore put protection of the patient’s health first over purely economic considerations which, according to consistent case-law, could also constitute a barrier to the fundamental principle of the free provision of services.</p>
<p>Thus, citizens can now obtain financial cover for in-patient care required by their state of health in cases where the care is provided in another Member State. The possibility of going abroad to be treated is therefore no longer reserved only for patients with financial means that allow them to bear these medical costs without the help of social security.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 of 14 June 1971, on the coordination of national social security systems<a href="#defann_27_4" name="refann_27_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> already lays down within the framework of Article 22, conditions for the reimbursement of care received in another Member State. Since this is care a person plans to receive in another Member State, the Regulation lays down cases in which Member States may not refuse prior authorisation for financial reimbursement of care received abroad. Consequently, this leaves all options for Member States to determine other circumstances in which authorisation may be granted. Furthermore, a political agreement was found at the Council, on 1 December 2003, on the modernisation and simplification of this Regulation. Within this framework, amendments made to the chapter on health insurance supplement the medical criterion used by the Court in its case-law in favour of patients. These provisions contribute to the improvement of transparency and complementarity between conditions for financial reimbursement laid down by the Regulation and those which patients may receive directly, on the basis of the free provision of services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Article 55 of Regulation 178/2002 provides for the drawing up by the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Member States, of a general plan for food/feed crisis management. In particular, according to Article 55, the general plan shall specify the types of situation involving direct or indirect risks to human health deriving from food and feed which are unlikely to be prevented, eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by provisions in place or by way of the emergency procedures.</p>
<p>The general plan for crisis management is closely connected to Article 56 of Regulation 178/2002, which provides for the establishment of a crisis unit by the Commission.</p>
<p>The concerned stakeholders, including European consumer associations, have been consulted on the draft of the general plan.</p>
<p>The general plan for food/feed crisis management will be discussed in depth with the Member States in early 2004. EFSA has been already consulted on the draft and will be associated in the discussions with the Member States.</p>
<p>A copy will be forwarded to the Honourable Member and the Commission will present it in the Environment Committee.</p>
<p>The draft, proposed by the Commission, should specify in particular: the type of situations in which the general plan will be applicable, the practical procedures for managing a crisis, including the practical functioning of the crisis unit, the link between the crisis unit and the legislative process (emergency procedures), the communication strategy and the principles for transparency.</p>
<p>The general plan is aimed at ensuring that the Commission, EFSA and the Member States co-operate smoothly in order to collect and share all available relevant information; co-operate on the evaluation of the data collected, the identification of appropriate risk management options and on ensuring consistent communication to the public.</p>
<p>These operational procedures are an additional tool to ensure an efficient management of a crisis through better co-ordination and rapid actions. However, they do not substitute/replace procedures used in the framework of the Commission’s or Member States’ or EFSA’s own competence. For example, since the Member States are responsible for the management of official controls on their territory, the specific modalities they have put in place to perform the necessary urgent controls in situations of crisis remain.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the discussions foreseen on the general plan will be an opportunity for the Member States to contribute by sharing their national experiences and best practices, including those signaled by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A levy is payable on imports of dog and cat food containing more than a certain percentage of starch.

<p>(FR) It is quite correct that customs law, as applied to dog and cat food put up for retail sale and classified under tariff heading 2309, varies according to the starch content of these products. This is particularly the case for feed containing around 30% of starch.</p>
<p>Customs laboratories in the Member States have therefore been set the task, by their customs authorities, to measure the amount of starch content in dog and cat foods and also to forward the results of the analyses they have performed to the customs services responsible for tariff classifications, with a view to establishing the tariff code applicable to this type of animal feed.</p>
<p>The modified Ewers polarimetric method, published in Annex I to Directive 72/199/EEC<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> must be the method of analysis used. It is now known that this method does not give proper results when the feed contains, in particular, beetroot pulp. For this last case, it is appropriate to use the enzymatic method described in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1822/86<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> known as the Boehringer method.</p>
<p>This issue has been examined by the Customs Code Committee, Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature section, Agrichemistry sector. It was revealed that despite using the same enzymatic method to perform these analyses, the customs laboratories of the two Member States concerned obtained different starch contents, 33% and 28%, respectively, which would lead to different classifications for the same type of feed.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that it is quite normal for laboratories to obtain different analyses results within certain limits which have been previously defined in interlaboratory studies.</p>
<p>In the case in point, however, the deviation observed went beyond normal variations and research into the reasons for these differences was justified. This is why delegates from the Member States who sat on the Customs Code Committee requested that the group of customs laboratories responsible for ensuring the coordination of work between the customs laboratories of the Member States within the framework of the Customs 2007 programme conduct a joint study on this issue in order to identify the reasons for these differences and to resolve this problem. This study is currently in progress and is due to end during the first half of 2004. A detailed report is planned for the end of this joint study, and the results therefrom will be entered into a database of analysis methods called 'Iliad', which was created by the group of customs laboratories and is accessible via the Internet. In this way, the results can be used by all the customs laboratories of the Member States and candidate countries. Hence, a uniform application of the analysis method can be ensured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with Declaration 17 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides that consultations shall be established with the High Commissioner for Refugees on matters relating to asylum policy, the Commission maintains close contact with the Office of the High Commissioner on EC asylum instruments. Consequently, it pays particular attention to the positions expressed by UNHCR in the course of the negotiations on EC asylum instruments.</p>
<p>High Commissioner Ruud Lubbers addressed a letter to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, ahead of a 27 November meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council, expressing his concern with the draft ‘procedures’ directive. An Aide Memoire was attached to the letter setting out in detail UNHCR’s concerns and a press release was also issued.</p>
<p>On 25 November the Member of the Commission in charge of Justice and Home Affairs and Mr Lubbers met and discussed the state of play on the draft ‘procedures’ directive. They have compared notes and agreed to stay vigilant. The Member of the Commission shares some of the concerns of the High Commissioner, in particular regarding the provisions on review.</p>
<p>The 27 November JHA Council took note of the state of play and concluded that no agreement was possible, under the current circumstances, whilst recalling that Article 63 of the EC Treaty sets a deadline of 1 May 2004 for adoption of this Directive by the Council.</p>
<p>The Commission will work closely with the incoming Irish Presidency to finalise the negotiations as soon as possible. The Commission has as its end goal a draft directive which amounts to a harmonisation of the asylum procedures of Member States which is as meaningful as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the 2003 Greek National Action Plan for Employment, measures to raise employment rates, combat unemployment and strengthen social cohesion and inclusion are among the main priorities of the Greek Government.</p>
<p>Greece has set quantitative targets for 2010 as well as intermediate targets for 2006 and 2008. These targets include a substantial reduction in the unemployment rate, a continuous increase in the employment rate, the improvement of educational achievement, a doubling of expenditure on active labour market policies as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product and reducing by half the number of people at risk of poverty.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that despite certain improvements, Greece must maintain its efforts to increase labour force participation and employment rates, to further decrease unemployment and to increase the participation rate in education and training, especially for the adult segment of the population. This will contribute to the effective implementation of the European Employment Strategy. In this context, it is considered vital to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of active labour market policies, including a major reshaping of the OAED’s<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> measures and programmes, in line with the mid-term evaluation exercise and in consultation with the social partners.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is essential to develop measures to combat undeclared work, by giving proper incentives, particularly regarding tax and pension systems.</p>
<p>Taking into account the progress achieved so far, the Council will address new employment recommendations to Greece in mid-2004 in the framework of the revised EES.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In its 13 June 2000 Communication<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission proposed a holistic approach to the enforcement of International Accounting Standards (IAS), acknowledging:</p>
<p>the primary responsibility of companies' management in properly applying the relevant financial reporting framework,</p>
<p>the need for a high quality statutory audit function in the Union and</p>
<p>the prominent role to be played by securities regulators vis-à-vis listed companies.</p>
<p>With regard to European securities regulators, in Recital 16 of the Regulation (EC) 1606/2002<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Commission called notably upon the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) to develop a common approach to enforcement of the financial reporting framework to be applied by Union listed companies.</p>
<p>In accordance with this implicit mandate, CESR started developing standards with a view to ensure effective and consistent enforcement of IAS in the Union. CESR Standard n°1 on Enforcement principles and the forthcoming Standard n°2 on Coordination of enforcement activities, which was submitted to public consultation in October 2003, set the basis for the creation of a coordination mechanism, associating both CESR and non-CESR enforcers, to enforcement of financial information, notably IAS.</p>
<p>Standard n°2 represents the framework for accommodating the diversity of enforcement infrastructures in place or currently being developed in Member States. Standard n°2 acknowledges that in many Member States, the actual enforcement of financial information is carried out by other bodies than CESR members (e.g. the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Review Panel, similar structures in Ireland, Sweden and Germany) in relation with CESR members. The coordination mechanism developed under Standard n°2 will associate non-CESR enforcers to the work on enforcement led by CESR.</p>
<p>Additional work is now necessary to identify those non-CESR enforcers to be associated to the coordination mechanism put in place; to set up a database of relevant enforcement decisions; and establish a confidentiality regime for non-CESR enforcers consistent with that applicable to CESR members.</p>
<p>This network infrastructure should deliver quality and consistent enforcement in the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

However, it is not yet possible for the EU's citizens or organisations to follow the progress of legislation or EU other projects by means of an Internet site common to the various institutions.

<p>(FR) The Commission reaffirms its commitment gradually to develop one-stop-shop thematic sites within the interinstitutional website EUROPA; this approach will be put into practice in the context of the 'EUROPA2' project.</p>
<p>Regarding the legislative domain to which the honourable Member refers, the Commission already has a specific site available to citizens (PreLex ), which allows 'virtual dossiers' to be compiled on all interinstitutional procedures.</p>
<p>In the course of 2004, this site will be closely linked to the law access portal currently under construction at the Publications Office, to ensure that citizens will visit no more than one instrument, thereby avoiding a duplication of tasks. It should be noted that PreLex has already anticipated this approach: this database does not contain any texts but is simply a detailed index on the state of procedures, supplemented by links to the collections of preparatory acts managed by Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Official Publications Office, links to the press releases from the Commission and Council's Spokesperson's Office as well as links to articles from the Bulletin of the European Union.</p>
<p>To conclude, the vision referred to in the honourable Member’s question is already becoming a reality. Some elements, like PreLex, are, at this very moment, up and running. Other functions (including those stemming from the merging of EUR-Lex and CELEX) will be operational in 2004. The Commission is endeavouring, using Internet techniques, to ensure that all the information appears to the citizens as a coherent whole, in particular by using common design standards which will enhance the interoperability between procedure indexes and the documents themselves.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0791"></a>

<p>Among the EU's agricultural products, olive oil is one of those with the brightest future, thanks above all to its positive effects on health and its excellent consumer image. Nonetheless, the Commission's recent proposal for reform does not take account of the realities of production in the Community: this could lead to a slowdown of production and could even substantially prejudice the expansion of the sector, to the detriment of the rural economy in many parts of the Union and, in the long run, to the benefit of third-country imports.</p>
<p>The Commission also fails to take account of the agreement reached in 1998 to review the common organisation of the market once the Union has reliable data on the sector. Is the Commission, despite this, sure that its proposed scheme is consistent with the objective of creating a competitive agricultural sector, or, indeed, with the objective agreed at the Lisbon summit of supporting those economic structures which promote full employment?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The proposal to reform the aid system for the olive-growing sector relates to the transfer towards a single payment of 60% of the aid payable during the reference period to olive-tree growers who farm more than 0.3 hectares GIS (Geographical Information System) and full single payment of the aid payable to small producers. By decoupling aid from production, the proposal aims to stimulate competitiveness in a sector which is already currently heavily market-oriented.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission is aware of the existence of a certain number of olive groves of considerable social or environmental interest which, for these reasons, warrant additional aid. It is for this reason that the Commission proposes the creation of national financial envelopes, from the part of the budget that will not be transferred to the single payment. These national envelopes will be used by the Member States to grant aid, the level of which can be set according to the social or environmental interests associated with the olive groves concerned. The proposal is, therefore, entirely coherent with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit.</p>
