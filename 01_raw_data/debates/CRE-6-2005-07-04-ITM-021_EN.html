In the long, hot summer of that year, the electricity systems in Europe could not cope, and a blackout in Italy and some problems elsewhere meant the Commission deemed this proposal necessary. This proposal should give transmission system operators the tools to balance supply and demand in a much better way.</p>
<p class="contents">The elements of the proposal concentrate on cementing good regulatory practice, to open the electricity market and to encourage investments in infrastructure in a more competitive market. Furthermore, the proposal clearly requires the necessary steps to be taken to meet the needs of the electricity industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their commitment to security of supply and infrastructure. In his report, Mr Chichester has introduced many important and positive amendments to the Commission’s original proposal. The Parliament has contributed a great deal to the improvement of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders regarding the delivery of secure electricity supplies and the upkeep of the networks. The Commission is therefore in a position to accept most of the amendments. However, the importance of cross-border interconnector projects has not been reflected sufficiently in the amendments made by Parliament. There is a clear regulatory gap in this area and the directive as drafted by Parliament does not fill this gap adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, the Commission takes note of the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council while regretting the change concerning Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains its position as to the need to strengthen the regulator’s role with regard to infrastructure investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission maintains reservations about Compromise Amendment 23. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their cooperation in the work on this report and on this proposal, which has enabled us to come before Parliament with a clear and united position. I also wish to compliment the Council on working with us in informal trialogue towards an agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Picking up on the comments of Commissioner Piebalgs, whom I naturally welcome here this evening, I should like to console the Commission for the way in which we and the Council have cut back its text and therefore some of the proposed powers that were envisaged, which we deem unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">When it came to us originally, this proposal reflected a certain element of split personality, because it addressed physical security of supply – keeping the lights on, and investment in infrastructure – but also market measures aimed at the same thing. It is not possible to underestimate the importance of energy in general and electricity in particular to our way of life, to our quality of life and to our standard of living. It is a vital element in a modern society and economy. Consequently, it is ironic that Parliament has chosen to put this item of primary legislation as the last item on Monday evening, although, naturally, I hope that we have saved the best until last for your edification.</p>
<p class="contents">Security of supply is about keeping the lights on. It must be admitted that we had quite a debate with the Council about whether to include a definition of security of supply in this proposal and, if so, what that definition should be. I am glad to say that we have prevailed and that a definition has been included in Article 2.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises: how does this directive help address security of supply – keeping the lights on, avoiding blackouts and outages – and what have we in the European Parliament added to it? The objectives are quite clear: it is about establishing measures to safeguard security of supply and ensure proper functioning of the internal market – these two elements of the proposal. It is about ensuring adequate generation capacity, an adequate balance between supply and demand and appropriate levels of interconnection. That is referred to quite clearly in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we in Parliament have insisted on the definition of the roles and responsibilities of a full list of players – stakeholders, if you will – in the electricity supply industry. We have sought to make Member States define those roles in the cause of security of supply so that everybody knows who is responsible for what. That includes Member States themselves. We have achieved the inclusion of a requirement for a report on overall system adequacy for operational network security for the projected security balance of supply and demand over the next five years and prospects for the security of electricity supply over the next 15 years beyond that, thereby flagging up what investment requirements will be needed. We can also claim credit for slimming down the original proposal and giving it more focus.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will not guarantee that there will be no more blackouts: that would be impossible. But it points out where responsibility rests and it will be for Member States to spell that out in detail so there is no uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Primary operational responsibility must be with the transmission system operators and, to some extent, the distribution system operators. But we should all recognise that a whole range of factors are involved in maintaining overall security of supply, not just transmission and interconnection. We must remember that the primary responsibility for that at present rests with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this proposal to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, I felt, when it came to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing up its draft opinion on this report, that the Commission and Parliament should offer us a global perspective on this issue. It is clear that a sound single market for energy cannot be created in an environment in which there is major inequality in the conditions of supply, in terms of price, regularity and indeed taxation. This crucial market will also be incapable of growing stronger unless there is a shared vision of the use of the various forms of energy production.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of safety – of the energy supply and the interconnection of infrastructures – must not merely be as a consequence of, and in response to, the sudden shutdowns that have happened in recent times and that have had a highly detrimental effect on the development of the European economy. These elements must be – and I wish to stress this point – the building blocks of the common energy policy and must be the catalyst for the much-needed policy of increasing energy efficiency and of diversifying sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, some of the proposals that I tabled in my committee did not receive the required majority, despite the fact that they are based directly on the philosophy that I have just detailed, a philosophy that, I am sure, is shared by most Members of this House. Stepping up investment in the distribution network and in the interconnection of networks will help to improve the competitiveness of the Member States’ economies and to drive forward the European economy. It will also make it possible to strike the necessary balance between supply and demand, within a framework of excessive differentiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chichester’s report takes these points on board and, accordingly, represents a positive step towards improving upon the Commission’s proposal. Nonetheless, the report needs to be adopted so that the codecision process can be closed at first reading. The main priority, however, is that the European institutions must be seen to be capable of reforming the energy market from a European policy perspective, taking a global view of every aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens of the Union likewise expect guaranteed security of supply, along with stable prices. Let us therefore ask the question: does this directive fulfil these expectations? Certainly in itself it does not. But there is a good chance that we are now taking a step in the right direction, bearing in mind considerations of competition and sustainability, and reconciling rules and objectives already negotiated and those to be negotiated in future. We certainly agree that reconciling these different perspectives is no easy task. But we also have to agree that there is a great need to ensure security of supply, reasonable prices and sustainability, because many European citizens have not yet been able to feel the benefits of market integration. We could no doubt mention many examples of this, but allow me to cite, as one such example, central-eastern Europe’s power generating units, which are not infrequently more than 40-50 years old, or the fact that, in purchasing power parity terms, a Hungarian citizen today pays twice or three times as much for electricity as the citizens of some of the older Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to expand transmission network capacity, an opportunity to develop new, cross-border connections and an opportunity to renovate production capacities. We will have to seize this opportunity, however, to ensure that this new legislation does not mean increased administration, more and more complicated licensing procedures, in short, a greater burden, but that it means genuine help for the sector and ultimately for consumers. This is what the citizens of Europe expect of us, so we should not content ourselves with less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have become so dependent on electricity now that we even switch on lights during daylight, such as now. The power cuts in recent years have clearly shown how vulnerable we are.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, the greatest harm affects the less fortunate, the poor and those of limited means. That is why the Member States and the Union should stress the importance of the security of supply, even though we still have no viable internal electricity market. This is just what is being emphasised in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Unquestionably, investment needs to be made, for example in transfer capacity, so that congestion can be eliminated. This way the internal market can be developed for the benefit of the consumer. Congestion should therefore be eliminated, which will make exchanges of electricity more effective and the network more stable. It will also facilitate market access conditions. We have to ensure that the same is also true of cross-border networks. There are significant bottlenecks associated with them, of course. The reliability of operations, so important for the public and for business, and the non-discriminatory nature of the market are compatible goals. Member States should ensure that competition is opened up and that existing legislation is implemented. Sluggish implementation of laws slows down Europe as a whole. It is a train that we find difficult to keep running at speed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you all that the Barcelona European Council asked for an assessment at the European Council next spring of the extent to which the internal market for energy has been implemented, and thus the extent to which this proposal has been made part of national legislation. Of course, we also need investment in infrastructure and interconnections. In addition, and in line with the Lisbon Strategy, we should enhance cooperation with the business and scientific worlds. Ecologically speaking, the primary focus should obviously be on energy efficiency and the latest environmental technology. Mr Chichester’s report is in favour of these basic principles of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my group supports Mr Chichester’s whole position. We are left with just one task, which is to secure the reliability of this, our common resolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we compare the draft directive as presented by the Commission with the compromise that we hope to adopt tomorrow, what becomes apparent is what this House is capable of achieving in the field of energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That this House has been able to exert considerable influence is attributable in no small degree to the unambiguous stance taken by the rapporteur. The Commission’s original proposal tended to exemplify a planned economy in which the administration would have determined in which parts of their infrastructure businesses would be allowed to invest. Parliament has succeeded in bringing out of this <span class="italic">dirigiste </span>document an approach guided by competitiveness, which will do a far better job of addressing the problems of security of supply, something made all the more important by the fact that Europe’s current development is characterised by an increasing demand for electricity, which has caused renewed attention to be given to the need for new power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">The right conclusion to draw from the power cuts in Italy in 2003 would have been that the blame for these lay primarily with the lack of competition in the clapped-out infrastructure. Particularly where public services are concerned, privatisation and competition are invariably two sides of the same coin. The Commission took a step in the wrong direction by assuming, as it originally did, that state bodies could make good the lack of competition and would, in cases of doubt, be more competent to judge which parts of the Member States’ network infrastructure were in need of investment. What, now improved, is left in the proposal for a directive itself shows how increased competition can be a winning strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">By promoting the conditions under which a wholesale market can function adequately and send appropriate price signals for investment in production capacity, the EU is taking the right approach to dealing with the issue of security of supply. Its most important objective must be the creation of viable energy market structures in which businesses can make money, that being the right incentive for the creation of an investment climate in which infrastructure can come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is not one of those that are toxic to enterprise, and a good thing too. We therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal and congratulate him too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The uninterrupted production of electricity and its secure supply are therefore important. It is the rapporteur’s opinion that the Commission has been too preoccupied with market mechanisms, instead of which it should have proposed some concrete action. Neither does our group believe that the market alone can solve all the problems of production and ensure the security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Nordic countries have bad experiences of the effects of market mechanisms on the price of electricity consumers pay. Electric power passes freely between the Nordic countries: Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Its price in the Nordic network is determined in their common electricity exchanges. The price reflects the fact that it is determined by marginal power produced at its most expensive, in other words, according to the highest possible price. This market mechanism is very unfavourable for consumers. The fact is that nuclear and hydro-electric power plants obtain the same price for their electricity on the coldest winter days as what is paid for the electricity that comes from coal-fired power stations, which are the last to be connected to the network. When the price of electricity from coal rises still further due to emission rights, the emission-free nuclear and hydro-electric power stations will receive compensation accordingly. For consumers a price mechanism of this nature is totally unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nordic electricity markets are a good example of the market not being able to solve all the problems. They are furthermore able to put up the price of electricity in a way that cannot be regarded as acceptable. We need government measures to safeguard different areas of investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report contains a number of considerations, the majority of which I agree with and believe to be of great value.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I should like to alert the House to three aspects of this issue that have a direct bearing on what we mean by safeguarding security of supply. The first of these is the need to take greater advantage of renewable energy sources. The environmental benefits of the latter are obvious and indisputable, and we should promote their use. The second aspect relates to an issue that has also been highlighted by the rapporteur, namely the importance of ensuring a balanced use of the various primary fuels in electricity generation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect, and one which I regard as absolutely crucial, is the need to secure diversified supply sources for each type of primary fuel. Here I mean not only electricity-related matters but also energy security in general. In my opinion, it is intolerable that certain aspects of the European Union’s energy policy mean that Member States are entirely dependent on one source, as in the case of crude oil or, most importantly, Russian gas supplies to Poland, which are guaranteed by means of projects. I should like to take this opportunity to call for the construction of the second leg of the Yamal gas pipeline to be speeded up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report deals with issues relating to cross-border supply and the main energy grid.</p>
<p class="contents">Small-scale power generation, which involves a small number of electric power plants fuelled by water, wind or geothermal energy and gas power plants fuelled by biomass energy, is also of enormous significance for energy security in individual regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a great many reasons why small-scale power generation of this kind should be encouraged. As well as being environmentally friendly, it reduces transmission costs and minimises the impact of outages in the main grids. Investment is needed to develop regional grids and small-scale power generation, however, and this includes investment in research. The small power generators frequently encounter problems relating to grid connection and the synchronisation amongst themselves. In my opinion, these problems should be given more emphasis in the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if that goal cannot be achieved in that time, it is certainly possible to create a stable environment for it by means of a further framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the increasing demand that is to be expected means that we need, first and foremost, a stable investment environment.

Security of supply can naturally be viewed from a number of perspectives, but in my opinion we should not concentrate solely on back-up systems and other technical aspects. After all, optimising the flow of electricity at critical times, or should I say peak load times, could have a considerable impact on the reliability of electricity supply, as well as reducing necessary reserves and costs, and, most importantly, providing greater security at times of potential crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that now is the time to set up some sort of independent international coordination centre. Systems are being connected and electricity trading is moving at a faster pace, which means that there is an increasing need for timely and more detailed information about electricity flows. Regional coordination is already in place between the Czech Republic and its neighbours, for example, and the same is true elsewhere. Why should we not provide a framework for such activities in the shape of an independent coordination centre for the EU as a whole? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The method used to find the best possible solution for the proposal made by the Commission is very admirable. The result is extremely good.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I should like to say that we have faced the same objective. All of us would like to strengthen the security of the supply of electricity. That means that we should find a way to secure long-term investment, stability of investment, conditions for investment, standards for transmission system operators and also inter-connection capacity in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Strategically the Commission has agreed with all discussions going on in the Council and Parliament. The only difference we have is on how to strengthen the connection capacity. From that point of view I very much hope that the proposal based on the collaboration between the Council and Parliament will work. If it does not, then perhaps we will need to find other methods to strengthen inter-connection capacity, because it is the link in the European energy supply. In general, as already mentioned, this directive definitely cannot rule out blackouts in some places in the European market. It definitely decreases the risks of such a blackout and strengthens the role that the energy sector plays in the well-being of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the Commission expresses a reservation on one particular issue, if the directive is agreed on this basis at Parliament's first reading, the Commission will welcome this directive.
