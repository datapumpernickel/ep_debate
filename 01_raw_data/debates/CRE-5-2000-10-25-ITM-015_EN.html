<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. –</span> Mr President, colleagues, it is always a pleasure to be debating with each other in such cosy circumstances late at night. I certainly did not know when I took on the rapporteurship of something as obscure as local loop unbundling that it would be quite so controversial and so complicated as it has proved nor that our discussions would culminate in such nocturnal circumstances. The local loop unbundling regulation is an important piece of legislation which completes unfinished business from the past but also represents an important step forward into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It completes unfinished business in the past because it is enforcing competition in the final segment of the telecommunications world which until now had escaped earlier liberalising European measures. At the same time, by ensuring that access to the local loop – the last mile of so-called copper wire – is now open to all new market entrants and is not the exclusive province of the so-called incumbent operators, the regulation will act as a significant boost for increased choice of non-voice services for consumers. It should lower prices for consumers and act as a boost to the take-up of new fancy broadband services and so point Europe very firmly in a dynamic, forward-looking direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, it will help fulfil the promise made in Lisbon in March of this year when a number of ambitious targets were set, which, it is said, will help ensure that the gap that has opened between the European Union and the United States in the information economy is closed as soon as possible. The procedure we had to follow, in order to act as quickly as possible upon the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit and the proposal of the Commission in July, has been unusual.</p>
<p class="contents">I am told that if we vote on the report tomorrow and adopt our report as voted in the committee it will be the fastest piece of legislation of this type ever processed by the European Union institutions. This has only been possible because of an unprecedented degree of cooperation. Firstly, cooperation with the Commission – and I would like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and all his extremely good officials who have been working on this for their assiduous help throughout the process. They really have provided us all with an invaluable service.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Council for their cooperation, firstly driven by the mandate in the conclusions in the Lisbon summit but also by a particularly effective series of French Presidency initiatives in the Council of Ministers and last and by no means least I would like to express thanks for cooperation within this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the privilege and the benefit of working with a number of colleagues of all groups who have pulled together in the committee to produce the report which we will be voting on tomorrow. I would like to thank all of them for the great cooperation which they have extended to me.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not been easy: firstly, because the procedure is difficult, it is new. Those of us who have worked on it all agree that if this sets a precedent for the future, we could perhaps consider promulgating some rules which will facilitate this kind of process in the future but also some rules on substance. This is a measure which is clearly going to prove to be painful to some of the incumbent operators involved and I understand that a number of colleagues have been in discussions with incumbent operators and I am very grateful to them for conveying their concerns to me and also working with me to find an appropriate way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be proud of the work that we have completed and that I hope we will complete by our vote tomorrow. It shows that, even in difficult and controversial areas of policy such as this, this House is able to act decisively and clearly when it needs to and for that I would once again like to extend my thanks to all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done some excellent work as part of this difficult process, and, taking into account the problems created by this ‘fast-track’ procedure both for the timetables for the legislative work and parliamentary debate, we should be very satisfied now with the compromise that has been reached. What is important for consumers is that the regulation should enter into force immediately from the start of the year. The matter is very urgent, as free price competition in local networks is one of the cornerstones of Europe and, more generally the development of the European information society.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly satisfied that Parliament, the Council and the Commission were able to work in such close cooperation in this matter and that they treated this complex issue, discussing it constructively, in an atmosphere of understanding that was perhaps unprecedented. As Parliament hopefully tomorrow will adopt the report, as I sincerely believe and hope it will, in the spirit of consensus achieved, the ball will then be in the Council’s court.</p>
<p class="contents">Free competition in local calls will benefit users of the Internet in particular. The telecommunications monopolies have been charging exorbitant sums of money until now. The European consumer has, in the worst cases, had to pay ten times more to connect to the Internet than the Americans. Reduced charges will lower the threshold at which people can start to use the Internet in their everyday tasks. For example, the limitless possibilities of <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce will be within easier reach for Europeans. Lowering local call charges will benefit everyone, including those who are not excited about byte-inspired adventures and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">National watchdog agencies have an enormous responsibility to see that the telephone companies that enjoy monopoly status really do open the end of the last copper wire to the new companies in the industry. It is to be anticipated that some monopolies will try every trick in the book to cling on to their competitive edge. This will have to be dealt with severely. The monopolies will have to be prepared to pay substantial sums in compensation if they delay opening up their networks. Only in this way may we ensure that there is free competition immediately at the start of next year. On behalf of my group, I hope that tomorrow’s vote has a positive outcome and then the ball really will be in the Council’s court, and we shall be able to apply the new regulations within the framework of new legislation at the beginning of the new year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has had a rather extraordinary time of it recently, but, despite all that, I must thank him. For the Commission this is an important and very successful achievement, it must be said. We have now a record in a field in which developments come so fast that records befit it rather well. Opening up local networks to competition is a "fast-track" opportunity afforded by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we are now taking full advantage of, as, otherwise, every day we will be losing money in the shape of exorbitant charges and creating barriers to the process. In just a few weeks we in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have dealt with this issue and have, under the leadership of the rapporteur, succeeded in negotiating this proposal with the Commission and the Council, a proposal that must surely be adopted tomorrow without amendment. This is my firm belief. We have in practice thus discussed the issue simultaneously with the Commission and the Council, as well as amongst ourselves and with many other parties, and now we have achieved this result, which is nothing to be ashamed about.</p>
<p class="contents">Local networks have, I would say, been the greatest bottleneck in the European telecommunications market and now it is being removed, and if it is not, then the national authorities can intervene, and if the prices are not right we then have recourse for compensation. Consumers and enterprises have lost millions and millions as a result of too high charges. Now charges for telephone calls, fast Internet connections and multimedia services will come down throughout Europe. This is just the right measure as far as consumers are concerned, and it will help us too. The networks have to open up with terms and conditions that are fair and non-discriminatory. That is very important. On the other hand, in the parliamentary amendments we have given consideration to the fact that the owners of the network and those who built it should not go penniless: they must receive a fair income for their work and, furthermore, their future investment in the network must be made possible for the future organisation of the infrastructure. The problem here of course is that privacy will suffer, as now anybody with the permission to do so can install their own equipment at exchanges and switchboards. Thus, the traditional secrecy of the sound telephone is now truly crumbling.</p>
<p class="contents">The auction of radio frequencies, however, is promoting developments in the opposite direction. It is pushing up charges to the consumer and has led to something like chaos in the market. This is pushing up charges, as I said, and what is going to happen on the fourth and fifth generation mobile front? States are losing their ability to control matters. Already things are moving in such a way that an oligopolistic situation is developing, which will result in the market being carved up directly. It was the case in Holland, and just recently in Italy, that the number of players taking part in auctions was only equivalent to the number of licences available. This is therefore a matter of a sort of private agreement, which means that the market can no longer function properly. I propose that the Commission should give an account now, while there is so much data on this, of what all this means. This is development in the opposite direction to what we have achieved in connection with this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As part of the European Union's general policy of opening the doors of every sector of social activity to big business, the regulation which we are examining today gives the monopolies what is perhaps the most important chunk of the telecommunications network. This infrastructure, which has taken a long time and a great deal of public money to develop, is being offered for a mess of potage, with the telecommunications organisations receiving no more than maintenance and operating costs in exchange. The argument that this will allow new services to develop does not stand up, given that these services can be developed by the telecommunications organisations equally well and, without the strain of having to make huge profits, certainly more cheaply.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission and the Council are not content with simply handing local loops to the private sector; oh no, they have to do it, and with what haste, in the form of a regulation which will apply immediately. I believe that we can draw useful conclusions from this example as to whose interests the European Union is actually serving. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN).</span></span>   – At the outset I would like to pay tribute to Mr Clegg who has worked extremely hard over the last few of weeks with a view to ensuring that the final report was well-balanced and reflected the concerns of the difficulties of the various political groups within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied that the text voted by the committee takes into account two issues which were of particular concern to me. The first one was fair pricing and the second was the provision of a universal service in the context of the further opening of the communications market to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important to ensure that the changes take place in a controlled way, to allow all players involved the time to adjust and to guarantee the rights of all consumers. It is clear that we must all support the upgrading of existing telecommunications infrastructures so that we can take advantage of evolving new technologies. In my country we are determined that our telecommunications infrastructure be of the highest standard in order to secure new investment into the country. Investment in our infrastructure is a critical component to the continued success and growth of the Irish economy; in particular, Ireland is aiming to become a world centre of e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it is essential that all citizens be guaranteed the same benefits from the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructures. The opening-up of the local copper networks to provide competition must lead to all local networks being upgraded in all towns and indeed in all villages. We must avoid cherry-picking by new entrants who might wish to upgrade only networks in the bigger urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of fair price, the price charge for access to the local loop must be allowed to reflect sunken costs in addition to a margin for reinvestment. In this respect I am glad to see that the Commission supports the historical cost formula for pricing. We must guarantee that existing telecommunications operators can secure adequate financial compensation for opening these local loops. I believe that the national regulatory authority should be able to play a fair and mediating role between existing operators and new networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that it is a fair and well-balanced text. I should like to thank Mr Clegg for being prepared to listen to so many of his colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this statement to become reality, it must be followed by measures to liberalise the markets, promote competition and thereby open up access for new suppliers of telecommunications services and in particular Internet services. In my opinion, the Commission and the European authorities have always been consistent with the Lisbon declarations: I refer, for example, to the proposal for a directive on e-commerce which, with the objective or the excuse of removing a form of discrimination against European producers who distribute information services will, in the end, be penalising the development of e-commerce throughout the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a matter on which we are, however, moving swiftly and, it would appear, genuinely in the right direction. Our rapporteur, Mr Clegg, has done a good job, making the Commission's proposal clearer and more specific and setting out the necessary conditions for that rapid conclusion of the legislative process which so many of us hope for and for which we too will vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to take this opportunity to warn the Commission that, once this regulation has been adopted, other obstacles will have to be tackled if the ‘last mile’ of the telecommunications sector is to be genuinely liberalised as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, Italy, the conditions for the liberalisation of the last mile have existed for a long time, but the national telecommunications authority has delayed practical implementation, in particular with regard to fixing price charges for access to the local loop. In the case of Italy, but also other European countries, this is probably due to the powerful position of the incumbent operator, which is trying to put off the move for as long as possible. There are parties who have much to lose and, in Italy, there is a conflict of interests between the State as regulator and the State as owner or controller of some of the main telecommunications services companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accelerated procedure provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam is being used for the first time, that is, there is no second reading. The aim of this is to approve the Regulation on unbundled access quickly, so that local telecommunications markets can be opened up to competition by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initial experience with this procedure suggests that it is only suitable in very exceptional cases, but that it is possible with important subjects like unbundled access to take legislative decisions with all due speed here in this House. I am of course particularly pleased about this. Without Nicholas Clegg and all his commitment it would not have been possible to consider the regulation so swiftly in committee and here in the plenary and, I hope, to approve it tomorrow. He has been able to reconcile varying positions and to present Parliament's views to the Council. My dear Nick, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you again very sincerely for your splendid work!</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need the regulation? Despite the complete liberalisation of the European telecommunications market since 1998, the "last mile", that is the subscriber's link to the network, is at present still in the hands of the "incumbent" telecommunications company. The regulation is intended to provide for competition in this "last mile". Only by ensuring that there is true competition in this market segment can we guarantee rapid and low-cost access to the Internet and to multimedia applications in the long term. This is not only the dream of every Internet user, it is also an urgent necessity in the era of the new economy. The reality in large parts of Europe is at present very different, so that dialling into the net is expensive, telephone lines are engaged while surfing the Internet, surfing is costly, and there are long waiting times.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest studies, at the beginning of 2000 only 400 000 Europeans had access to broadband services, compared with 3 million in the USA. The European Commission has therefore rightly decided to lend a hand here – and quickly. In my opinion there is no other alternative politically speaking but to approve the regulation in its present form and thus remove the final bottleneck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To give one light-hearted example, his compromise proposals reached me when I was on the way home on the motorway. Of course I pulled over, in accordance with the law, and then discussed them further with him. This shows how we worked on this and I think that this was superb. We are also willing to do this again in future, but we could do with a bit more time now and again to discuss particular points in still greater depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political objective was to enhance competition and so smooth the path to the information society. This regulation is intended to achieve a marked improvement in competition in the local access network, with the aim, for example, of giving Internet services better access to the mass market, so that market penetration will increase. This initiative will ultimately also help to promote the information society. But quicker and cheaper Internet access without content is worthless. Above all, the information society must mean investment in people and their skills.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point is that the regulation regulates in the spirit of the original telecommunications liberalisation, that is in an asymmetrical way. This has certainly demonstrated its value when it comes to improving competition. But this regulation will be superseded in future and we will move on to a new regulatory framework under competition law.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>In view of that, I would say that Amendment No 13 is particularly important, as it provides for a new Recital 10(a) which emphasises once again that a new regulatory framework will replace this regulation in the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">Of at least equal importance is the fact that the Council is not holding up the telecommunications regulatory package. I also trust that the Council will adopt it soon and that we will continue the consultation procedure on the rest of the package quickly and in a serious manner. I hope that the Council will not leave us in the lurch should one or other Member State perhaps still have reservations. Our work should set an example here. We have reached agreement quickly and effectively, and I hope that the Council will follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has been very unflappable throughout and, on behalf of the House, I would like to record that at the time he was successfully decoupling the local loop, he was also making a very successful coupling of his own, by getting married. I am sure that we all pass on our congratulations to him.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not surprise this House to know that, as a representative of the British Conservative Party – and it was the Conservative Government that privatised British Telecom over 17 years ago, probably the first of the large-scale telecom privatisations in Europe – I very much welcome this essential further action to deregulate and open up the market. In pushing this forward it has been very important for the Commission to lay the foundations with the telecoms package that we are now considering and we very much admire their ambition and their zeal to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">My only comment, when looking at the slightly loose wording on some of the timing – for example, that notified operators shall from 31 December meet reasonable requests from beneficiaries – is to ask the Commissioner to assure us that he will be very severe in monitoring this, because there is no point in pushing this text through here if we have very slack and loose implementation in the Member States where this also needs to be pushed through.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also say this that this has been an admirable initiative resulting from the Lisbon summit but a lot of other key aspects concerning moving forward in the new economy were mentioned in Lisbon? Who is going to use all this new low-cost deregulated capacity? We want to see the new entrepreneurs, the new Internet companies coming into the market. I remind the Commissioner that one of the other key aspects of Lisbon was the creation of new conditions in the European economy, to get the new investors. Can I encourage him with the new spirit of adventure that we see here – and perhaps that is not a word that we always associate with the Commission – to move forward with zeal and vigour to achieve these other aspects of Lisbon with the same effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed Commissioner Liikanen's predecessor, Commissioner Bangemann described us once as 'we few, we happy few, we band of brothers'. He rather ignored the sisters but I think you get the drift from his Shakespearian quote.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on the legal instrument – the regulation – because it is exceptional and historic and there are very special reasons: reasons of speed – post-Lisbon summit – and reasons of technical consistency which I think we all appreciate and understand. Parliament must be ready to look at new ways of working, imaginative and, as Mr Harbour says, adventurous. But we also must make it clear when such measures are appropriate and it is almost certain that the other parts of this latest telecommunications package are going to take rather longer and will be along more traditional lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment too on one very important part of Mr Clegg's proposal which relates to the powers of national regulators and powers of initiative, which I think are very important components in the speedy and consistent enforcement and implementation of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Others have mentioned the Lisbon summit and it is of course right to stress that this legislation follows a commitment from the European Union Member States to support the growth and use of the Internet in Europe under the e-Europe action plan. Much of this would not happen without this promise to provide affordable, high-speed Internet access and we note the importance of unbundling in the success of the e-Europe plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that the combined efforts of the Commission, Parliament and the Council have brought about this legislation as part of an overall effort to modernise telecommunications law. This effort will bring openness, transparency and competition to the industry while balancing the need for regulation with the desire for liberalisation. We have more legislation ahead of us and we have to learn the lessons from so much of the legislation with which we have been jointly involved over many years in the past. Then we tried to look backwards, to extrapolate from what we had done, before looking forwards and guessing, second-guessing or third-guessing what lay ahead of us. We made mistakes in such a fast-moving and volatile market but I would like to end with the point that if Europe is to stay competitive, to stay in this field, to bring the very real benefits of e-Europe to all the citizens of the European Union, to remain ahead in third-generation mobiles – if I can jump ahead – vis-à-vis the United States of America, it is going to need all our combined efforts to make sure that the total package is safely accomplished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome these promised developments. But as the rapporteur mentioned, many of us have been made aware of the concerns of the local telecommunications provider. The Irish telecommunications provider, Eirecom, maintains that it should be allowed a reasonable time period to implement the changes and that the 31 December deadline is practically unachievable. Also, charging for unbundled access to the local loop should be fair and adequate to ensure the long-term development and upgrading of the local access infrastructure. If it is not financially viable to invest in less populated and less developed areas, it is unlikely to be attractive to new operators.</p>
<p class="contents">When we combine this possible scenario with other measures that adversely affect rural areas, such as the liberalisation of the postal service, which threatens the survival of small rural post offices, and the recent closure of many small rural banks, how will the possible reduction of investment in long-term development and upgrade of local access infrastructure affect already disadvantaged rural regions? It is my sincere hope that none of these concerns becomes reality and that in future we avoid the risk of seriously limiting discussion in Parliament by speeding up procedures on issues that will ultimately have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have heard this evening, for some in this House, the closing of the final chapter of a public monopoly can only lead to an automatic reduction in the costs of local communications and this can therefore only be positive for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">For others, including me, this is far from being quite so obvious and, above all, quite so automatic. If unregulated competition always leads to a permanent reduction in prices, and always benefits each and every consumer everywhere, this would have happened long ago. Moreover, the example of mobile telephony, which is completely open to competition, proves precisely the opposite. Real prices of calls from mobiles continue to be high and the transparency of costs and prices is far from being guaranteed. Between the hype and the reality there is not a divide but a chasm. Many citizens have fallen victim to this and are unable to pay their bill, and resort to declaring their mobile stolen.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I approve of unbundling, but simple, clear constraints need to be worked out in this area as well in order to define the limits, follow progress and lay down terms for the financing of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur and colleague, Mr Nicholas Clegg, has certainly done a lot of work, and I congratulate him on that. He has even been open to the arguments of his colleagues, and I thank him for that. But he is very liberal and so he has naturally rejected anything that could lead to a genuine universal service. He is more afraid of public monopolies than private monopolies. I hope, therefore, that the framework directive entitled ‘A Universal Service’, for which I was appointed rapporteur in July of last year on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and which I now have to salvage despite the attempts of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, will enable us to redress the balance to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Clegg has correctly and very seriously set forth the Commission's proposal on unbundling from a technical standpoint. But I am sorry to say that, as I see it, he has not adequately responded to the longer term risk posed for the weaker and the more susceptible players in a deregulated system, and to the risk posed by private monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, I repeat once again that, for me, a public service must not be a sink for the market. It must be, and it can be, an objective in itself and, for us Europeans, a value and an asset for balanced and sustainable development. All things considered, Madam President, as the three European institutions are in agreement on uncoupling, I will not be more catholic than the Pope, and I shall therefore be voting in favour tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we really are taking genuinely forward-looking steps as far as the European public is concerned. The public in Europe will feel, in their wallets, in the quality of services and also on the labour market, that these measures have made Europe more internationally competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that UMTS will provide us with a new service. The environment and telecommunications will in future play a very special role in international competitiveness. That is why I think it is important to create a level playing field. This directive in particular demonstrates that we have been very thorough in aiming for fairness, and this has been a model of how to legislate, with a review, with a proper and thorough examination, with all stakeholders being consulted, and, lastly, a good, efficient, swift and precise procedure in the European Parliament.</p>

I do not normally take a position in this House which is based purely on national considerations but it seems to me that we are attempting to put in place a regulation which is inflexible and does not take into account the position of the market in Ireland. The proposal that we have will oblige Eirecom, a private limited company, a former state monopoly, to open up its local loop to alternative providers and will not oblige alternative providers already in the market place such as cable TV, satellite and wireless local loop operators to do the same. They are excluded from the scope of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Cable TV companies in Ireland already possess the network and are already gearing up their network to provide telephony, Internet and other interactive services. In many cases they operate large and exclusive franchise areas. In the case of Ireland, penetration rates by these companies in the larger cities and towns is of the order of 90%, far exceeding those of Eirecom PLC. It is impossible to understand and entirely unacceptable that the proposal does not also encompass these TV cable companies. In addition, fixed network operators such as Eirecom will find it impossible to compete with these companies which are providing bundled services to customers, which often include Internet access and free local calls as part of their standard bundle of service offerings.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly where an alternative competing network coexists with a copper network, either all should be unbundled or none. This will be consistent with the stated justification for unbundling put forward by the Commission. The regulation on unbundled access to local loop is by its very nature inherently flawed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that worst law is in most cases bad law, and this is the case in relation to this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The night sessions are not always the greatest pleasure in the European Parliament but tonight, I must say, it has been an extremely pleasant and positive debate. I share the view of those who consider this issue to be historic. It is historic in two ways.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we will now complete the long march towards liberalisation of telecommunications. This also serves the interests of universal service. When we increase competition in the networks it will cut prices, improve quality and make the services more affordable. It will help to create an inclusive information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is historic in the sense that we have replied to a question which is often asked: Is Europe too slow to act? Are we able to seize the opportunity of information technology? There is a lot of suspicion around. Can Community institutions ever make it? If Parliament were to accept tomorrow the Clegg report we would show that we can. We can show that we are able to act in Internet time. We will have concrete proof, which would increase enormously the credibility of the European Union, especially in the eyes of the younger generation which lives in this age of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this would not be possible without excellent cooperation between the institutions. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Clegg, for the excellent work he has done, and also the whole committee. It would have not have been possible without profound knowledge of the issue. Neither would it have been possible without a strong will to negotiate, with many partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank the Council presidency, which has been very firm and very determined to drive this issue through. In many Member States it has been a very sensitive and complicated matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gallagher and Mr Haarder raised a few issues in this context. It really is a key part of the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe action plan to liberalise the telecommunications market to make the prices cheap and the quality of service higher. At the same time we must remember that this is one side of the coin. On the other side, we need people with skills and qualifications who can use these services. So we must continue to invest in the education of all people, young and old alike.</p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as the implementation of this regulation is concerned, yesterday the national regulators had a meeting with Commission officials. They agreed to try to accelerate the implementation on this regulation and to do it in as harmonised a way as possible, so as to have a strong European market in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also welcome practically everything in the report. The report is supportive of the objectives and draft measures included in the Commission proposal. I should just like to mention three of those.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the aim is to mandate operators not defined as having significant market power in the provision of fixed telephony networks to provide unbundled access to the metallic local loop from 31 December 2000 under transparent, non-discriminatory and cost-oriented conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to ensure transparency by other operators we will have to publish a reference offer for the access conditions to the local loop and associated facilities such as co-location, including pricing, under the scrutiny of the national regulatory authority in order to ensure fairness. Here I am happy to note that the national regulatory authorities want to cooperate to make this effective everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the regulations to unbundle the local loop will allow new entrants all types of access modalities where technically feasible, full unbundling and shared access to global loops and sub-loops. This maximises technical innovation, greater competition and choice for users. The Commission accepts in full all 18 amendments to the Clegg report. They improve the Commission's proposal, providing for more accurate technical definitions and more specific requirements of the national players and national regulatory authorities. These amendments are constructive and will ensure that the regulation is fully operational. Thus they guarantee that unbundling is rapidly and effectively implemented from 31 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also hopes that the Council will approve the text as amended in the report and hopefully accepted by Parliament tomorrow. Then the Council would be able to complete the codecision policy in one reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
