<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Council</span><span class="bold">. − </span>Mr President, after a brief, but heartfelt, welcome of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which was felt by all to be a tribute to past work and an invitation to redouble our efforts for the future, the focus of last week’s European Council was on the economic issues, namely the implementation of the Compact on Growth and Jobs approved last June and the discussion on the interim report on deepening economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p class="contents">We also spent time on some foreign policy questions and touched on a matter which I know is of concern here, the appointment to the vacant seat on the Board of the European Central Bank, which was raised both by me and by your President in his speech at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s commitment to promoting the equality of women and men is an objective laid down in the Treaty. Yesterday’s vote by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the appointment is an understandable expression of concern that a great deal remains to be achieved, notably regarding the European Central Bank. But I note also the committee’s recognition that the candidate’s professional competences are in no way in dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, at last week’s European Council, I made a strong appeal to all Heads of State or Government to identify and propose female candidates for vacant posts at European level, in particular in the economic and financial sectors, where the under-representation of women is blatant. I underlined that we need to be active in encouraging this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, with such renewed commitment to gender balance, Parliament will base its final decision on the current candidate for the ECB executive board on the sole criteria of professional qualification and experience. It is urgent to fill that vacancy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me move on to the economic questions which were at the core of our discussions. First, growth and jobs. We are still suffering from a lack of growth – 25 million people are unemployed in the Union, many of whom are young people. Overall growth projections for next year are at best modest. I am painfully aware of the toll this is taking on our societies. In several countries, the adjustment is more severe and lengthy than many had expected. Reining in budgetary deficits and restoring competitiveness would have been necessary even without the crisis in the eurozone. It is therefore all the more necessary to share the burden of this adjustment fairly and to have policies especially targeted at reducing unemployment. Here, the EU instruments can and should assist.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating jobs and boosting socially-inclusive growth remains our utmost priority and our ultimate goal. The commitments made under the Compact for Growth and Jobs cannot wait: they must be followed by decisive action and translated into concrete results. This is particularly urgent for the implementation of the EUR 120 billion package we agreed in June, for progress on the single market issues and on our EU-2020 goals. It is also urgent for measures supporting social inclusion, promoting research and development, developing the competitiveness of our industries, and harnessing the potential of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meanwhile, we will discuss in November the multiannual financial framework at the European Council. We need a growth-oriented EU budget. Although it represents only 1 % of European GDP, it can, as an investment budget, have a huge impact on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, restoring confidence in the eurozone is a key part of bringing back internal demand and growth. On this, we can now witness the first results of our cumulative actions. Let me give a few examples. The so-called spreads are decreasing significantly in almost all eurozone countries. Public deficits are now lower in most countries. Competitiveness and export performances are stronger in all countries. The upcoming common bank supervisor is a major breakthrough and we launched two weeks ago the European Stability Mechanism so that our ‘firewall’ now amounts to EUR 700 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Greece, significant progress has been made. The eurozone Heads of State and Government issued a statement welcoming the determination of the Greek Government to deliver on its commitments and also commending the remarkable efforts of the Greek people. The Eurogroup will examine this progress in light of the forthcoming troika report and take any necessary decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second major debate was on the interim report which I drew up in collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank – a group of four presidents who also met with your President, Martin Schulz. My office also consulted Member States and the European Parliament’s delegation, whose contribution was significant. I also personally met some of your rapporteurs, coordinators and committee chairs. This was an interim report seeking to clarify concepts and test the level of support for various ideas that have arisen, with the aim of reaching conclusions in December. It highlighted points of convergence and outlined areas that would require further work. The European Council gave a mandate to continue this work and propose a specific and time-bound roadmap to be presented at its December meeting so that it can move ahead on all the essential building blocks on which genuine EMU should be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Our immediate priority was progress on financial integration. In June, we agreed to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. The urgent element now is setting up a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) to prevent banking risks and cross-border contagion from emerging. That is why the European Council called for swift progress, with the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework by 1 January 2013. Once this is agreed, the SSM could become effectively operational during 2013. This places a huge responsibility on all of us to meet this ambitious timeline. We cannot afford to risk losing momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">When establishing a Supervisor, several aspects need to be taken into consideration. First, there must be a clear separation between the monetary responsibilities of the ECB and its supervisory functions. The ECB should be able to carry out supervision directly in a differentiated manner, meaning using national authorities in supervisory tasks as much as possible. The SSM will be designed and implemented with the integrity of the single market for financial services in mind. Finally, the mechanism should be inclusive and transparent: all Member States are free and invited to join. This openness should be reflected in the governance structure, with appropriate rights and obligations for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The SSM is a first, essential step towards a complete, integrated framework for the financial sector. Other steps also need to be taken quickly, starting with harmonising national resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, following which the Commission will propose a single resolution mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">As agreed in June, direct recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism will be possible once an effective SSM has been established. We asked the Eurogroup to draw up the exact operational criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">For a stable economic and monetary union, we also need stronger integrated frameworks for budgetary matters and economic policies. On both these fronts we have already done a lot. Let me put it this way: if we fully use all our tools – the six-pack, the forthcoming two-pack, the European Semester with its country specific recommendations, the new macroeconomic imbalance procedure and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance – then we will have already taken a major step towards fiscal and economic union. Yet to secure the eurozone’s long-term stability, we also need to be able to better deal with economic shocks and spur economic convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, some new avenues in my report attracted attention. I received a mandate, together with my colleagues, to explore them further between now and December. One of these is that Member States could enter into individual arrangements of a contractual nature with the EU institutions on the reforms they commit to make, in response to the country specific recommendations of the Council, to promote growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another is the possibility of an appropriate fiscal capacity for the euro area. This new idea requires further exploration and it was agreed that this is unrelated – I emphasise ‘unrelated’ – to the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be crucial for the new EMU to be fully legitimate and accountable. As a general principle, we all agree that democratic control should occur at the level where decisions are taken. It is also important to build this deeper economic and monetary union on the EU’s institutional and legal frameworks, and to make sure that it remains open and transparent towards Member States outside the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">As in all our regular European Councils, I wanted to devote some time to strategic discussions on our external relations and our foreign policy. We focused on two main issues. First, our relations with China – taking a step back and looking at the long term. I debriefed the European Council on the September Summit with China, a very positive one. As you know, this key partner is undergoing a ‘once in a decade’ leadership change. We exchanged views on how to engage constructively with the new leadership. We must pass on the same messages to Beijing, both the easy and the difficult ones, in our contacts at all levels. China presented a package of proposals for future cooperation between the EU and China. We will respond in the same spirit with our own proposals. We will come back to this issue to prepare the next summit, which should take place in China in autumn 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we addressed crisis areas in the world: Syria, Iran and Mali. This was indeed the first time that we had discussed developments in Mali at European Council level. The situation has a security, humanitarian and regional impact on the Sahel. It could also become a threat to our own societies and to our own security. The Union is contributing to the international efforts led by the United Nations to stabilise the situation. We decided to accelerate our own planning for a possible European military crisis management operation and support for the international military force, in accordance with the recent UN Security Council Resolution 2071.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this was a positive summit. It is good for Europe that we will have a single supervisory mechanism up and running in the course of 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Between now and December we will work on further progress to reinforce our economic and monetary union. The biggest contribution to growth in the short term is restoring confidence in the eurozone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, last week’s European Council was the first in a series of three summit meetings this autumn. Our objective in these meetings is to reach decisions which will have a significant impact both on short-term stability and our longer-term objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we must deliver on the Compact on Growth and Jobs agreed in June. The reality is that the crisis is still with us: too many of our Member States are facing recession; unemployment remains worryingly high (with the potential to further undermine social cohesion), and I am painfully aware of the difficult situation in which many European citizens find themselves. Implementing the growth compact is, therefore, much more than a demonstration of our political will; it is a question of fairness and equity.</p>
<p class="contents">In some of our Member States, citizens are making major sacrifices because of the situation resulting from excessive debts in the public sector and irresponsible financial behaviour in the private sector. This is why we need to provide citizens with hope, and a realistic prospect that growth and jobs will return and that the most vulnerable in society will not suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has delivered a great number of proposals and inputs to underpin the Growth Compact. However, the reality is that this Growth Compact, including an important investment package worth EUR 120 billion, has not yet been fully implemented. Some progress has been made, but frankly it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I presented to the Heads of State and Government a detailed report describing what is on the table, where the blockages exist, and what the next steps are. It is high time that proposals on negotiation tables became reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give some examples. Agreement is within reach on the proposals on venture capital, accounting and alternative dispute resolution in the next two months. But work on several other proposals that are crucial for growth and fairness in the single market needs to be accelerated. Public procurement reform; a tax on savings, including mandates for agreements with third countries; professional qualifications; e-signatures: we need to give a new political push in all these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I urged the Member States’ governments to do their utmost to bring the Compact on Growth and Jobs to life. Likewise, I count on this House to assume its responsibility and play its part in finalising legislation on its elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us demonstrate to our citizens that Europe carries a message for growth and jobs. When talking about growth, it is clear that the financial sector must also make a fair contribution to recovery. I welcome in particular the recent progress on a European Financial Transaction Tax. Following the requests we have now received from 10 Member States, this very afternoon the Commission will make a proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation. This will be the first step in the process. We will also present an action plan on tax fraud and tax evasion – including tax havens – before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to confirm to you that, following the adoption of the employment package, the Commission will introduce a Youth Guarantee Scheme before the end of the year. This will aim to ensure that young people are presented with either the offer of a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of being unemployed or leaving formal education. This will be supported by the European Social Fund. We will also introduce a quality framework for traineeships to help young people in their transition from education to work. We are taking these measures to prevent a ‘lost generation’ in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the Compact on Growth and Jobs where we have to turn political will into reality. It is essential that by the end of this year there is agreement on the single supervisory mechanism for banks. This is also a pre-condition for the direct recapitalisation of banks under the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">By reaching agreement on this, the European Union has a huge opportunity to restore confidence, demonstrate its capacity to take difficult decisions in times of crisis and send a message of stability. Let us not fail to seize this moment. And let us also be clear about one thing: reaching agreement on these issues is a fundamental precondition if we want to be credible in our further deepening of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Single Supervisory Mechanism for banks, without prejudice to the ongoing legislative process, the European Council confirmed many of the key principles on which the Commission proposals were grounded. This includes being as open as is legally possible to all Member States who want to participate. As we have stated time and time again, we do not need new walls in Europe between the euro area and non-euro area members.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need proper accountability at the level at which decisions are taken, which for the Commission clearly means to this Parliament, and maintaining the level playing field and the integrity of the single market. This also includes tasking the ECB with responsibility for prudential supervision and the power to intervene, if needed, with any bank in the euro area, as well as a clear separation of this supervisory function and monetary policy. We will continue to work closely with the European Parliament on all these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">One important element is the political commitment of the Heads of State and Government that agreement should be reached by the end of this year. I hope that the governments will now respect the commitment they have taken at the highest level. Let us not forget why we are acting here: we are advancing in our response to the crisis. We need to definitively break the negative link between bank debt and sovereign debt – and this is urgent. That is why the Commission put its proposals on the table within weeks of the June European Council. Delivering the single supervisory mechanism will give a very important signal to our citizens, but also to our international partners and to investors in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also spelled out the need for rapid adoption of the provisions relating to the harmonisation of national resolution and deposit guarantee frameworks based on the Commission’s legislative proposals on bank recovery and resolution and on national deposit guarantee schemes. It also called for a rapid conclusion of the single rule book, including agreement on the proposals on bank capital requirements. This House has a decisive role to play in all these matters, and the Commission will work closely with you in the coming weeks to move ahead quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I look at the other, longer-term elements of deepening EMU, let me start by underlining how crucial it is to finalise the legislation known as the ‘two-pack’. The prior coordination of national budgets is one important pillar of our crisis response, and it is in the interest of the European Parliament, I would assume, that we incorporate as many elements from the Fiscal Treaty into the Community method as is legally possible. This is what we are doing with the two-pack.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the European Union institutions and Member States have embarked on a reflection process which will cover all aspects of a deeper EMU (including issues of solidarity), I am hopeful that we can agree that the two-pack goes ahead and not deal with other issues covered by the further deepening of the EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as these other aspects of EMU-deepening are concerned, the summit was also an occasion for the Heads of State and Government to look in more depth at the issues on the basis of the interim report prepared by the President of the European Council, myself, and the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup. I would also like to underline the very useful contributions that the European Parliament and President Schulz have made to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the next steps, I had already informed this House last month that we will deliver a blueprint for EMU in time before the December European Council. This blueprint will set out the Commission’s own thinking on all the building blocks of a deeper, genuine EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me a specific word about the issue of the fiscal capacity of an economic and monetary union. As I said in the State of the Union address before this House, to deliver lasting results, we need to develop a fully-equipped Community economic governance, together with a genuine, credible Community fiscal capacity. This would complement our efforts for a stronger and more binding framework for the implementation of key economic policies, in particular in the euro area, as one important means of preventing imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">While much has been done here, for instance through the Six-pack and the country-specific recommendations, further steps are crucial to combine specific conditions with specific incentives and to really make economic and monetary union sustainable. One interesting idea in this context is that of contractual arrangements between the Member States and the Commission. Such arrangements could underpin the commitments taken under the country-specific recommendations with specific support for their realisation. We must, however, be clear that this has nothing to do with the decisions on the next multiannual financial framework, which we will, hopefully, be able to take in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank this House for its important contributions and the cooperation with it on all these matters. It is very important to have the views and the involvement of the European Parliament at every stage in this process. We are designing a new system whereby more decisions will be taken at European level. We therefore need stronger accountability. Fixing accountability at the level where the decisions are taken will be one of the fundamental principles which will guide our discussions on economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we need to make sure that more democracy means more transparency and not more complexity. We already have a very complicated system of decision-making in Europe. A proliferation of institutions, mechanisms and procedures would make Europe more opaque and less readable and would distance us from our citizens precisely at a time when we need to draw closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a few more key principles for these reforms. First, we need to build on the existing institutional and legal framework based on the Community Treaties. We must support the deepening of integration in the euro area as the basis for strengthening our currency, the euro. We must ensure convergence between the existing and future euro area members. And we must respect the integrity of policies conducted at the level of the current 27 (very soon 28) Member States of the European Union, particularly the integrity of the Single Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our tasks are mapped out. Let us not forget that, beyond the Growth Compact, the two-pack and banking supervision, we have other tasks and responsibilities this autumn. I am speaking in particular about the MFF. I expect those governments which are always talking about the need for investment to promote growth and jobs to contribute their support for the instrument for investment at European level. Once again this will be a critical test of our commitment to these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">During the summit we also had an opportunity to send a very important message regarding Greece at the level of euro area Heads of State and Government. I welcome the conclusion of that meeting, when we said: ‘We expect Greece to continue budgetary and structural policy reforms and encourage its efforts to ensure swift implementation of the programme. This is necessary in order to bring about a more competitive private sector, private investment and an effective public sector. These conditions will allow Greece to achieve renewed growth and will ensure its future in the euro area’. It is very important that the Heads of State and Government have expressed this willingness and this commitment and their hope about keeping Greece in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Council discussed the external dimension of our actions, with a focus on our strategic partners, including China, and the need for a proactive agenda for trade. It is crucially important that Europe defend its interests in this globalising world. But openness is a vital element in facing the challenges of growth, and we must not miss out on the opportunities for further trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that, at a time when many of our citizens have doubts about the ability of Europe to meet the challenges we face, the international community, through the Nobel Peace Prize, has sent us a clear message: the world needs a stronger European Union. It is indeed an honour to have this recognition for the project for integration and unity of this continent which has, over 60 years, brought us so much. But it is also a responsibility and a challenge for us to show the ‘courage de chaque jour’ – the everyday, mundane, courage – to do the right thing and take the decisions we need to take.</p>
<p class="contents">By advancing the deepening of economic and monetary union and progressing towards a political union, let us make sure, together, that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 will not be awarded to an idea of the past but to a project of the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, President Van Rompuy, I would like to start with the same issue that you began with, namely the European Central Bank and gender equality. First of all, I have a rather different view on the substance of Mr Mersch’s comments. I was extremely disappointed by them. However, I am even more disappointed by your position and your explanation here today. Mr Van Rompuy, it is simply not good enough!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are not prepared to accept this kind of evasiveness. We have shown personal commitment because we believed that we could move forward, and we have built bridges. The President of this House built bridges, and yet all you have to say about gender equality is that, yes, we do not have enough of it! What we wanted was not a description of the situation but a commitment from you on how to move forward, and I am very sorry to say that we did not get it!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As for the Council, I believe that the outcome was half-hearted. I would not go as far as to say that it was negative, but it lacked substance. As for the Compact for Growth and Jobs, we do not need 27 or 28 countries to meet in order to determine that, so far, it has had no effect. The Member States must play their part in ensuring that it is effective. Indeed, that is the critical task for the Member States. However, the problem is not only the Compact for Growth, of course. I think it is very regrettable that we have no opportunity to discuss in more detail today the reasons why the Commission and the majority on the Council still do not accept the World Bank’s findings, namely that their calculations are wrong and that the policies which we are pursuing are leading us into recession. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and, indeed, the Liberals are blocking any discussion of this issue. It is not about the Compact for Growth; it is about changing our policies for growth. We need policies at last which do not lead to recession but promote growth and employment. That is what I am demanding from the Commission and from the majority in the Council!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do you not see that as unemployment rises, so does Euroscepticism and even outright rejection of Europe? That is the problem we have today. Chancellor Merkel and Mr Schäuble are throwing up a smoke screen, and there is a lot of talk about eurobudgets and a super-commissioner, but this is not going to solve the problems we face today. Even with the banking union, we can see how important it was that François Hollande said that we need the banking union now, or relatively soon. That is not just a question for France and Germany. It is a question of two fundamentally different concepts. The one says that institutional issues are important, so we will think about a convention which we want to appoint as soon as possible, perhaps as early as December, and we will think about a super- commissioner. However, as for thinking about the social problems which our policies are creating – no, they do not want to do that, nor do they want to think about the problems facing Spain and Ireland with the banks and their recapitalisation. Let me assure you that as Socialists and Democrats, our Group will not leave Spain or Ireland to fend for themselves. We will fight to make the banking union a reality soon – with sensible rules, of course – and to ensure that the ESM can finally progress with recapitalisation. Those are things that we agree with, Commission President. Indeed, that is why we are resisting these delaying tactics. In-depth consultation? Yes, by all means, but we need a solution soon, for we do not want any further deepening of the crisis in Spain and Ireland and other countries, with even more people losing their jobs. That cannot be our goal. For us, that is an intolerable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to mention the social question again. Mr Van Rompuy, we need this fifth sector, this fifth pillar, on social issues. That is an urgent necessity. We cannot have a situation in which social issues are simply mentioned in passing and dealt with in a few sentences. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said at the press conference that they can see the misery within society. Let me say it again, gentlemen: your job is not to describe what is happening. Your job is to change the situation and to work for a social Europe. That is what we need!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are very proud of the Nobel Peace Prize. We are handing out badges because we are so proud of this achievement; that applies to us as a Group as well. However, we were not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for social peace within the EU. We do not deserve that yet. If we are awarded a Nobel Prize on that basis some day, I will be very satisfied with what we have achieved in Europe. However, we have not achieved it yet. On the contrary, many of the measures being agreed today move us in the wrong direction. </p>
<p class="contents">My final comment concerns Mr Cameron. We should make one thing very clear to Mr Cameron, who wishes to veto the budget. Mr Cameron, the fact is that we have a stronger veto: if you veto the budget, there will still be another one, namely the budget for 2013 and 2012! I would be very happy if Mr Cameron were to pursue that course of action, if he showed that he is not interested in Europe, and if he issued an even stronger rebuff to countries such as Poland and so on. We have more leverage than he does. If Mr Cameron does not want to give us his support, we will simply take the 2012 budget as the basis for the future budgets. That is the message that Mr Callaghan should be taking back to Mr Cameron! </p>
<p class="contents">I have one final comment on this subject: it is not acceptable for Mr Cameron to steadily withdraw from Europe while still wanting to have a say on every issue. Mr Cameron and the Conservatives, but also the Liberals in the United Kingdom need to make a decision. If you want nothing to do with Europe, then act accordingly, but do not try to have a say on every issue or contribute to decision-making on what happens in the Europe that you reject. Decisions on Europe should be taken by those who are committed to Europe. In my view, that is a fundamental principle which Mr Cameron needs to understand. </p>

Nevertheless, I have to tell you that I thought it had already been decided in June – but better a European Council that decides the same thing twice than nothing at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad to see that the Council finally agrees with the position of the European Parliament and that of the European Commission. We said from the beginning that this system has to be applicable to all banks, and it was an absurd idea to supervise only some banks.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is also what our colleague Mr Swoboda said on the timetable. I have to tell you that I am less positive, because this timetable that they agreed on is firmly linked to – what? To the electoral calendar of Germany. I find it irresponsible that we first of all have to wait nine months before we can start to implement something that we will approve here through legislation by the end of the year. Nine months to wait for what? For the electoral calendar and the outcome of the elections in Germany. This is the intergovernmental method; if every time you have to wait for the electoral calendar of France, then Italy and now Germany, you will do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the Paper. I think there are many good ideas in the Paper, and there are also ideas with which I have some difficulties: the idea of individual contracts, for example. I do not think that our European Union is what I would call a private law concern, based on contracts between the Member States and the European institutions. No: we want common policies and binding legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point on the paper is on mutualisation of debt. May I ask you, Mr Barroso – you know, I will do it every time – every month I will come back to you and ask you: where is your proposal on the redemption fund and on the start of a Eurobond market? Because you know that it is the only way that interest rates can go down in the European Union. Take, for example, Slovenia. Slovenia is a country with less than 60 % public debt; at the same time it has a fiscal deficit of more or less 3 %, and it has an interest rate of 6 %, because it is a small market and nobody is interested today, with this crisis, in buying Slovenian bonds. The Eurobond market is the only way to solve it. I can tell you I have talked about the necessity to approve the two-pack, while Parliament’s position is clear: if there is no proposal on the redemption fund on the table, we will not approve the two-pack. It is the same for Mr Schäuble’s proposal. Mr Schäuble can say, ‘I want the Super-Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs’. We will not go in that direction – even if I am in favour of that proposal – if there is no proposal on neutralisation of the debt as a first step towards the redemption fund or a first step towards a Eurobond market. We are firm on this within Parliament because we know that it is the only way to end this crisis, besides all the other measures which need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, something completely different, Mr President: Syria. It is time for the European Council to do something, for the Nobel Peace Prize winner to do something. We all know what is needed in Syria. We need, as fast as possible, a no-fly-zone so that Assad can no longer do what he is doing now: using his air force to massacre his people. Aleppo, dear colleagues, is becoming more and more like Dresden. Daily bombardments, shelling by the Syrian air force and a whole city in ruins. I find it a scandal that neither the European Council nor the other European institutions are taking their responsibility regarding that scandal together with the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think she has hit exactly the right note with her proposal for quotas. I would also like to send a message to all her female colleagues and the other female Commissioners. I believe that every woman who has achieved power and influence in today’s European Union should be aware that on the one hand, this is of course due to skills and qualifications; on the other, however, it is also due to the fact that other women have campaigned for instruments such as the quota. This awareness should guide all those who are tasked with decision-making or who are in leadership roles, such as Ms Reding’s female colleagues at the Commission. Mr Barroso, I urge you not to undermine a positive initiative that enables the Commission to stand out as a beacon. On the contrary, I urge you to give Ms Reding your support. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Mersch, it is a great shame that Mr Mersch, of all people, appears to be undermining Ms Reding’s strategy. Indeed, let me make it clear to Mr Van Rompuy that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not support this under any circumstances. Perhaps it is enough for you to know that women have a future at the European Central Bank from 2018 onwards. However, this knowledge and prospect are not enough for us! We want a woman at the centre of power in the European Central Bank today, and we are not going to be fobbed off by you. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Nobel Peace Prize has been mentioned in passing in today’s debate. I was starting to think I was mistaken. When I first heard about this decision, taken in Europe’s northern-most region, I was deeply and genuinely moved. As a European politician, I almost took it personally. I felt that this came close to being an unexpected declaration of love for this great shared European project. Of course, it also meant that I looked forward to the summit with very different expectations, Teflon-coated, perhaps. So what happened? Where was the moment of reflection? What happened to the Nobel Committee’s appeal for reflection and for ‘thinking big’ in the European Union? From my perspective, that is the crucial aspect of the award: it makes us think about what we have achieved by working together, and what we may achieve in future. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, it has been agreed once again that we should give ourselves more time to deal with the banking union. We can afford to do so because the European Central Bank has bought itself some time under Mr Draghi, as it did before under Mr Trichet. Once again, we have seen the crisis pass from an acute to a chronic phase. However, you should not take too long, nor should you be under any illusions, as you were once again with your speech today. In my view, at the end of December, we not only need to have the clear contours or a legal framework for supervision in the banking union. We also need to have the other two pillars in place, the two pillars which are never mentioned in the front row, namely deposit protection and the possibility of bank resolution in the European Union, which must take place in a process which is not only subject to democratic controls but also inspires confidence. In other words, there is a lot to do before the end of December. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me take up a point made by Mr Swoboda. Mr Van Rompuy, you said earlier that things are improving. You obviously consult a different set of statistics from mine. Perhaps we should swap. I have figures from the IMF and the World Bank which clearly show, once again, that single-minded and aggressive austerity policies do not improve matters. They do not even support the recovery of public budgets. In our crisis countries, we have higher deficits, and we also have an ailing economy, not only in the crisis countries but Europe-wide. We also have higher unemployment, especially among young people. Knowing this, I then came across a further publication from the IMF which says that fiscal consolidation can only be successful in the context of economic recovery. This requires very serious consideration, and highlights all of the shortcomings in the present policies to overcome the crisis. Economic recovery can only take place on the basis of better growth policies. I am interested to see what will happen now. I regard the comments made by Mr Tajani and Mr Oettinger almost as a threat. As for Europe 2020 – which, incidentally, they appear to have written off entirely – let me say that I cannot imagine being able to achieve sustainable economic recovery with industrial policy strategies of the kind proposed by Messieurs Oettinger and Tajani.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, was it President Hollande or Chancellor Merkel? After the summit, everyone was asking who had won. If we needed any further proof that the two of them did not merit the Nobel Peace Prize and did not match up to the Nobel Committee’s expectations, it can been seen in this particular issue. Political union and deeper European integration have to be dragged out of them. Chancellor Merkel should go to the German public long before the election and explain why financial solidity on its own makes matters worse. President Hollande, for his part, should explain to the people of France why even France has to transfer sovereignty to Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, there was the support for the single market of 27 Member States, developing more open trade, the cutting of some red tape and the withdrawal of some pending Commission proposals. These were all good things. However, we need to see more action on all of those initiatives and my group will certainly support Mr Barroso in taking these initiatives forward.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it comes to the main topic of debate – yet again the euro crisis – we can see that the summit manifestly failed to deliver. Both Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso spoke in this Chamber after the previous summit in June. They spoke about balancing solidarity with responsibility and described the results back then as ‘significant’. They said that these took Europe a few more steps down the road to recovery. Well, of course, over the summer it became clear that some key Member States had had second thoughts about what they agreed then, and the few small steps forward were overwhelmed by some pretty giant leaps backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The only significance of that summit, with hindsight, was that it represented yet another missed opportunity. The window created by the actions of the ECB to enable political leaders to get ahead of the curve in reassuring the markets was lost then, and it is lost now. No amount of fudging over the timetable for the supervisory mechanisms or the carefully chosen words about mutual support can cover up for the fact that this summit simply backtracked on what had been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of sympathy for both Mediterranean Europe and Northern Europe, but we cannot go on with this stalemate, with one side unwilling to hand over budgetary sovereignty and the other side unwilling to hand over its chequebook and its cash. It seems to me that, as Mr Verhofstadt observed, we now have no chance of making any headway towards a solution to the crisis before the elections in Germany. The problem that we face is quite simply one of leadership. To take a topical example that has been mentioned in this debate, when the EU was awarded this famous Nobel Prize, the bickering began immediately about who was going to collect the prize, who was going to make the speech and who was going to talk at the dinner. I started thinking about all of those political leaders and organisations who actually really deserved to collect that prize for delivering peace in Europe, for holding firm during the Cold War and for challenging the might of the Soviet Union. I thought about the contributions of General de Gaulle, President Reagan, Prime Ministers Kohl and Thatcher, NATO, and Pope Jean Paul II. No doubt everyone in this Chamber has some figure that they want to put forward as contributing to that list. It seems to me that they had one thing in common – they had political courage, the courage to stand firm, to take political risks and to make sacrifices for what they believed in.</p>
<p class="contents">What a sad contrast to the modern day Europe of today, where difficult decisions are delayed, timetables slip, and political realities are ignored. It was sobering to note that that Nobel Prize was awarded to the EU, not because we are dealing effectively with the current crisis, but because we are failing to do so. It is not a message of congratulations to Europe’s leaders, it is an act of charity. The prize has not been given to the EU because it is strong and doing well. It has been given now because the EU is weak and doing badly. That was made clear in the citation itself – in the announcement – if you read it.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us put aside the self-congratulations and let us forget the mutual backstabbing. Let us get on instead with the difficult task of making the urgent decisions that are required to make the European economy competitive and to launch the project again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is the right decision. I also see it as sending out a signal which, hopefully, when the time comes, will secure majority support in this House, because it really does send out completely the wrong message to tell us that Europe should continue to be run solely by men, and to say that everything arising in the various policy areas dealt with by the European Union, whatever is necessary to safeguard social and indeed regional cohesion, can only be dealt with by male representatives. I think this is the wrong form of representation, at least in the majority of cases, although I admit that there are exceptions. </p>
<p class="contents">The results of the most recent summit are relatively limited. A previous speaker said that at the end, two victors appeared in front of the microphones and cameras and went through the usual ritual of saying that there were no losers. There are losers, however. Ordinary people are the losers. People within the European Union have lost out because once again, we are playing for time, because no one has given any thought to the fact that European policy needs to be corrected as a matter of urgency!</p>
<p class="contents">I will come back to the example of the Compact for Growth and Jobs in a moment. You surely cannot seriously be proposing in your recommendations or in the Council’s decisions that, ultimately, the Structural Funds must be reprogrammed to fund the Compact for Jobs and Growth. This would mean that 25 % of the ESF would be under threat. With that proposal, you are also putting a question mark over the future of the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion. In the fight against poverty, we are talking about the fate of 120 million in Europe. Then you say that the Nobel Peace Prize for Europe is well-deserved. It simply does not add up!</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, which signals should the summit have sent out? Firstly, there should have been a recognition that austerity policies do not automatically lead to more growth. If the International Monetary Fund can do it, it should be child’s play for the European Union to admit that these policies have plunged hundreds of thousands more people into poverty and social exclusion. We do not need an undemocratic fiscal pact which erodes the rights of the national parliaments and especially the European Parliament. We need a solidarity pact, one which is designed for 99 % of the people of Europe, to replace the austerity pact from 1 % of the people. We need sustainable growth which can only be achieved with decent work, equitable redistribution and appropriate contributions from those who caused the crisis in the first place. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a look at Greece again: the next tranche will amount to EUR 600 million and is supposed to be spent entirely on repaying the national debt. That means that almost EUR 30 billion have now been earmarked solely for the banks. Portugal was in a similar situation: of the EUR 78 billion allocated, only EUR 8 billion were actually earmarked for the public budget. What you are talking about, and what is being practised here, is certainly not the right balance. That needs to change, and that is what we are demanding. The timetable – the roadmap – for the banking union is really only a brief moment. Why will you not admit that this is simply about splitting up the national banks? You do not mention the ECB’s mandate and role as a lender of last resort or the ancillary roles which could be played by the European investment banks in this context. You need to change your approach. You need to change course – and then perhaps we can talk about the Nobel Peace Prize being well-deserved! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown... But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through the fault of unelected, incompetent Eurocrats and blinded Member State leaders, the financial crisis is being used as a tool for further EU integration. What a heavy price we are paying for the Eurocrats’ fantasy of a United States of Europe. Have they learned nothing from their folly?</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso and his apparatchiks care little for the ordinary person. This latest round has been done on the back of the Greek collapse and the 43 % increase in the suicide rate there. My fear is for the UK which, despite being out of the eurozone, is seemingly unaffected. Yet this deal fails to safeguard the City of London and its prosperity. David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats. But Cameron turns out to be nothing more than the German Chancellor’s poodle.</p>
<p class="contents">Three out of four Conservative voters want an ‘in or out’ referendum but are being deceived by their leadership, which continues to sleepwalk the UK into a federal Europe. So I call on those Conservative supporters to stand up to David Cameron for the future of your party and for our country.

<p class="contents">The main necessity for the banking union is the moral hazard which exists in asking taxpayers to shoulder the recapitalisation of private banks, and even their rescue. The idea is for banks to borrow directly from the EMS, under conditions to be established in the coming months and through a supervision mechanism at European Central Bank level, and thus to decouple the burden of Member States’ sovereign debt for the sake of banks. If a number of banks now need direct support, this is due to the necessity of capitalisation at the new levels required and to the non-serviced loans as a consequence of the economic crisis. That is why this new mechanism should apply retroactively, covering banks that are now in this difficult situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I mean by that is that, contrary to popular belief, I do not believe that the European crisis is behind us. Thus, we do not want proposals for tomorrow or the day after, we want actions for today, and I will give you a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the banking union. We are all in favour of it. The key is to make it effective and make it operational now, not in a year’s time, in order to allow recapitalisation of the banks; otherwise, of course, public debt will increase, and that would not be very smart.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, alongside the banking union, we need a solidarity mechanism, the creation of a European bond market. Once again, we need to do it now, before the countries in difficulty are completely ruined and, indeed, need more support from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards the budget and the economic and investment policy, we need to implement the necessary public policies now; otherwise, there will be a recession tomorrow. It is better to do this before there is a recession than when in the midst of one, because then it will be too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as regards gender equality in the European Union institutions and the ECB in particular, Mr Van Rompuy, we need to act now, not in 2018. Otherwise, what kind of credibility will we have if we are defending women’s rights outside the European Union yet having to teach a lesson to the governments of certain countries that do not respect those rights themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the political union, democracy and democratic legitimacy, which accompanies them, we need to put these issues on the table now and make progress on them now; otherwise, we will lose the confidence of the European people once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I cannot congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras, Vice-President of this Parliament. On Spanish television he suggested sending the Guardia Civil to Catalonia to deal with moves towards Catalan independence. This remark was utterly appalling. Let the Catalonians themselves vote on their future. Look at Prime Minister David Cameron with regard to Scottish independence. Cameron said, ‘OK, let’s hold a referendum in 2014’. That is the way to go about this, ladies and gentlemen. Not the army, but democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to explain his remarks, Mr Vidal-Quadras sent us a letter which makes it even worse. Here is the letter. Reading it, I had the impression that it had been drafted by General Franco himself. He calls Catalan independence neither peaceful nor democratic. Well, what about him? So, dear winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, what are you going to do about that?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, what are you going to do about it? Not much, so far. You said that Mr Vidal-Quadras was just expressing his private opinion and that he was not speaking as a Vice-President. But he was. He was announced as Vice-President and he is Vice-President 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is he not? So, Mr President, please do not run away from reality. Call upon your Vice-President to apologise to this House, to apologise to the Catalan people and to resign. He does not reflect the dignity of his position and he is not worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. I would say to Mr Vidal-Quadras ‘<span class="italic">verguenza </span>– shame on you’!</p>

Instead of giving the bankrupt countries the opportunity to leave the eurozone if necessary, the discussions focused on a fiscal union, with Brussels in control of the national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">More robust supervision of systemically important banks is undoubtedly to be welcomed. After all, uncontrolled speculation has created a situation in which bank after bank has had to be shored up with taxpayers’ money. Nonetheless, banking supervision, no matter how effective, cannot contribute substantially to ending the euro crisis; for that, what is needed is a comprehensive reform of monetary union. However, instead of applying the brakes at last, the eurozone is apparently to be further centralised, with talk of a single budget for the eurozone and, indeed, Eurobonds, which would amount to nothing less than the irreversible ‘communitisation’ of debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It looks to me like banking union ‘lite’ – getting the taste without the commitment. But, like monetary union, the ‘lite’ version will tie Member States together with de facto mutualisation in the event of systemic failures. Of course, we hope that stays theoretical, but citizens should know. Meanwhile, to avoid mutualisation, the ESM is out and recapitalising Spain’s current bank debt is out. Bond buying is linked to other conditionality. So what is the hurry? Is it a question of pushing through a good news story before the citizens get to understand it or before Parliament finds a better way, leaving the substance to never never?</p>
<p class="contents">We are working to this mad timetable, but I see this as ‘legislate in haste and repent at leisure’ when a few months more could actually deliver the real deal. For all the gung-ho about banking union, I see no sign of it in CRD IV, which is still an exemption fest. Is it the intention for the ECB to stop all that? I think we should know and we should know up front.</p>

I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain.</p>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, it has not been an especially successful summit, and this is because of the following: the repetition that sees some decisions taken and then taken again, the slowness with which some measures are put into practice and their vagueness once they are, and, finally, the failure to achieve a balance between strict austerity and real social content. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reiteration of agreements, it must be said that, now that we are approaching almost 30 summits, it is hard to tell one from the next; we remember the summit of May 2010, because it was the ‘Austerity Summit’, and that of June 2012, because it was the ‘Growth Summit’, but while austerity has certainly materialised, we have yet to see growth to the same extent. </p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the slowness and vagueness of the measures adopted, the European Council conclusions usually state that it is essential that the measures agreed are implemented swiftly, but, looking at the conclusions of the recent summit, it is phrases such as ‘in the coming weeks’ and ‘work is under away’ that predominate, while the only thing that really is under way since the ‘Growth Summit’ is the EUR 100 million for a political programme. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the lack of balance, the fact is that the Council’s work does not include a significant amount of social content or social dialogue, and there is a danger, for instance, that it will fall to the Member States to find solutions for the problems arising from poverty. We need a European response to help Europe’s poor. It is the only way to lend the European Union legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed. </p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented.

There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative. </p>
<p class="contents"><br />We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament.

The most recent Eurostat statement shows unambiguously that our crisis management is inadequate. In spite of this, decision-making at the current summit continues to be erratic. No decisions have been arrived at, only a direction. At the same time, I think it is important that the new banking supervision should be able to start operating on the basis of the current EU institutions and treaties, and that in future a clear separation will be made between the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and its supervisory responsibilities. We have wasted a great deal of time, but this is not a good reason to make irresponsible decisions now on the pretext that time is short, and which could result in flawed supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the sort of decisions that will be detrimental to non-members of the eurozone, or indeed to those who voluntarily sign up to the new supervisory mechanism. It is a well-known fact – we have stated this several times and we will not deny it – that the crisis does not respect borders. This is why it is clear to me that we must also have cross-border crisis management – while of course taking into account the interests of the Member States. In other words, saving the euro requires maximum integration. For those of us who have stated that we want to join the euro in future, it is unacceptable to hear talk of a multi-tiered Europe in connection with banking supervision. Those who say this are flying in the face of the fundamental principle of European solidarity. They have not read the signs of the times and they are refusing to learn from the bitter lessons of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The citizens of my country, and other countries too, who are experiencing the harsh reality of budgetary adjustment, should soon come out of this situation. As regards the single supervisory mechanism, this is indeed an element in the deepening of monetary union, and its creation must be expedited. All too often, the banks are part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, comments have been heard here about whether or not there is equality between the sexes. We must move on from talk to action. Europe received the Nobel Prize, not only for what it has done in the past 60 years, but also for what it ought to do in the future, and especially in the immediate future, as a force for stability, democracy, freedom, social justice and growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, confidence has not been restored and it is confidence, above all, that is necessary to recreate a financial and economic climate that is conducive to economic growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, complex structural problems require structural solutions, in the Member States, but also in the Union. That is why we are anxiously looking forward to the final road map to a strong economic and monetary union that you, Mr Van Rompuy, have been working to complete with the Presidents of the other institutions, and that you plan to use to eliminate the flaws in the economic and monetary union. It has to be an ambitious plan, a plan that is implemented without delay, because the crisis will not wait for politics. That is also the reason why we in Parliament are not sitting around doing nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week in Brussels, we voted on my report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the building blocks of the road map<span class="italic">.</span> As rapporteur, I would, of course, recommend that you read it. We discuss the four building blocks but we also add a fifth: a social pact to remind us what it is really about.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the banking union is concerned, Mr President, we are working hard on amending the proposals, as the Commission’s text really could be improved on a number of points, but that need not cause any delay. We in Europe will be able to take further significant steps during the course of this year if everyone shoulders their responsibility. We in Parliament will certainly not cause any delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that progress has been made. Precisely because I agree with everything said by Mr Kasoulides, I would simply like to ask the President of the Council one question: those countries which are struggling and which are receiving assistance have fought hard for the retroactive application of the scheme to bank debts in order to decouple their sovereign debt. This has apparently not been accepted. However, we heard statements yesterday from the highest German and French authorities that Ireland would be treated as a special situation. My question is whether the Council has approved a decision to act discriminatorily and treat Ireland in a different manner from countries such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and so on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the outset, we agreed, firstly, that in all of the Member States, we must make more sparing use of our financial resources; secondly, we agreed that we urgently need structural reforms; and thirdly, we agreed that we need to stimulate growth. We have done all this. The truth is that things are moving forward. This is happening slowly, but we are making progress. Sometimes, I do not understand why there are these agitated speeches, as if we were constantly expected to reinvent the world. We are on the right track. Mr Van Rompuy, I am most grateful to you for being such a staunch advocate of an approach which relies on steady and systematic work. It is not about introducing something new every week. It is not about producing a new instrument or investing hopes in some other marvellous innovation week after week. What we need is a systematic approach. That is the only way to move forward. Indeed, progress is being achieved, slowly but surely. Thoroughness and reliability are better than speed and a hectic approach. That is why implementation and systematic controls are more effective than a constant stream of new ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy with the way we are working now. In fact, let me say this on the topic of banking supervision: it does not matter which day we introduce this system of banking supervision, as the two Presidents have said. What matters is whether it works. We ourselves adopted all manner of decisions in connection with the European Banking Authority and we wanted more. Today, we are doing things differently, more systematically. What matters is whether and how the new structures work, not when they work. So I would like to thank you for this systematic and somewhat calmer and more dependable approach. I think it is the right one. What ultimately counts is not who talks a better game but whose actions speak louder than words.</p>

<p class="contents">Can I also ask the ushers here in the Chamber to approach the individual discussion groups that appear to be forming and perhaps make it clear to them that they should take their seats. Unfortunately, I do not have a command of all of the various languages; otherwise, I would make the point myself in Spanish, for example, given that part of the PP delegation appears to be holding a meeting here in the gangway.

Consistency in enforcement is a principle which must apply at national and European level. You underlined this in the case of Greece, and rightly so, but to achieve consistency in enforcement, government commitments are not enough.

<p class="contents">The European Research Area must remain a priority that we should implement more rapidly in line with the Ljubljana Process. We must facilitate mobility for researchers, and in particular proper working conditions and comparable pay for the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare ourselves with the United States, we need to do more primarily in the area of designing a suitable environment for researchers and private investors. Our deficit of up to 3 % of investment in research and development lies principally on the side of private investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the internal market binds us and provides an opportunity for development. However, setting this up comes at a price, which we must take into account when adopting budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">An example is the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators: owing to the low budget there is indeed a threat to implementation of the Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT), which should prevent information abuse and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the strong words from the Council regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, but at the same time I regret that next week a European Parliament delegation will supposedly be visiting Iran.

The Stability and Growth Pact has shown that political supervision does not work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. − </span>Mr President, first of all regarding the assessment of this European Council, some of you have probably noted that in my initial statement I mentioned three European Council summits. I did that on purpose because this summit was important in terms of confirming some earlier decisions. That represents some progress already because the reality is that, unfortunately, doubts existed as to the commitment of some governments regarding decisions they had taken previously. In fact, though, the final decisions on some of those most important matters will come later, namely regarding the EMU in December and regarding the MFF, hopefully, in November.</p>
<p class="contents">So my assessment of this European Council is that it was certainly a step forward in terms of previous decisions being confirmed, but it was not yet the comprehensive response needed for the current challenges in the euro area and in the European Union. I consider this a fair assessment of the results of this European Council. Of course we have to know that we are working on extremely sensitive matters where, to be frank, the initial positions of our Member States are very diverse and where the interest, I believe, of all the European institutions is to create the right conditions for consensus and operational decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">One point where there was some progress was on the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and I am also glad that this debate today has shown a broad degree of consensus on the principles set out in the Commission proposals and reflected in the European Council conclusions. These include, most importantly, that the SSM should cover all banks, that there needs to be openness – as full as possible – and to have as full as possible participation by the non-euro Member States which so wish, and that the SSM is a key element in proving that the European Union is capable of moving forward, of restoring confidence, deepening the EMU and opening up the way to decisions on bank recapitalisation by the ESM.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the determination expressed by Parliament, namely by rapporteur Ms Thyssen, to advance the SSM work so that we can reach a quality result by the end of 2012. The Commission will work closely with you to further improve the SSM proposals and open the way for the operational phasing-in of the system in 2013 – as had in fact been proposed by the Commission – starting with systemic banks and eventually extending to all banks in the euro area and participating non-euro area Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue that was mentioned here – I think it was a question by Mr Mauro – was the sense of urgency. I want to tell you that I made that urgency clear. The reality once again, if you want to be honest in our assessment, is that not all Member States feel the same degree of urgency. This is probably due to the fact that they are in different financial and fiscal positions, but I believe that it is important for the credibility of our response that this response is properly prepared. Some of these issues are extremely difficult from a political and technical point of view but the decisions should be as urgent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was raised concerned a social pact for Europe. How can we complement some of these decisions with proper consideration of the social dimension? The elements proposed in the social pact are, to a large extent, already reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy. That is, let us not forget, a strategy for inclusive growth, and in fact the macroeconomic imbalance procedure has been an integral part of the implementation of this strategy during the second European semester. This has implied a number of new challenges for all of us, notably in terms of ensuring that the labour market and social issues are adequately reflected and assessed within this new framework.</p>
<p class="contents">This integration results from the fact that economic growth and employment and social aspects are two sides of the same coin. It was interesting to see in the debate that many people are speaking about having a real minister for finance in Europe. They should probably also be thinking about having a real minister for the economy in Europe, so that we complete the work on financial stability with a commitment to sustainable growth and also to the economic and social dimension. Employment and social cohesion are not just an outcome of economic growth but are also an important determinant. The Commission strongly believes that our values of social justice, solidarity and equal opportunities must remain at the heart of European integration and continue to be understood as prerequisites for our future economic prosperity, for the well-being of European citizens and for European cohesion. They must also appear in the European Union’s growth agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of 2013 the Commission will present a social investment for growth and cohesion package which will also address various aspects mentioned under what some of you have described as the social pact. The message I want to convey to you is that, yes, we are doing everything we can with the tools and instruments available at European level to inject this economic and social dimension into the broader response to the current crisis in the economic situation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the future responses on mutualisation of debt, you know what our position is. The Commission has stated it and we will also address this issue in the blueprint I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">One point I want to make clear, and that I do not agree with, is the position of those who say that they are in favour of the content of the two-pack, they are in favour of more integration in supervision of budgetary policy, they are in favour of reinforcing the competence of the Commission and the European institutions, the Community method, in terms of economic governance, but they will not support this – they will not approve it – before decisions are taken on other issues like the redemption fund. This is a mistake. It is a mistake because if you make progress on one very important issue in the European Union dependent on other issues, where you know very well that there is not yet agreement between all our Member States, you are in fact paralysing progress and economic governance in the euro area. That is a choice for you to make, but my strong advice to all the pro-European forces is to support everything that enables us to put as much as possible under the Community method and in the European institutions and this is certainly the case with the Two-pack proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now another issue which was mentioned was the situation regarding some statements made by the IMF. I want to be clear on this aspect as well. The reason we have this crisis today, contrary to what some Eurosceptics suggest, is not because of the euro area. We have a crisis today in the European Union economy because of excessive debt created by national governments and because of the irresponsible financial behaviour in some sectors, including outside of Europe. So Europe was not the cause of the problem, Europe is indeed the victim of the problem and is now trying to be part of the solution. This is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was irresponsible behaviour in terms of the excessive debt of public authorities and the sometimes completely irresponsible behaviour of some actors in the financial sector which created the problem. The proof of this – that this is not the problem of the euro – is that, for instance Mr Farage, your own country, which is not a member of the euro, is now implementing a very difficult austerity package. The British people are suffering the consequences of past mistakes. It was not the euro that created the Britain’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So it is intellectually – I repeat – it is politically and intellectually dishonest to pretend that the euro is the cause of our problems. In fact, it is the European Union that is part of the solution because, without the support of other countries in the euro area, some of our Member States would not have the financing necessary to keep their states running, to keep their social services, to keep their national health systems, to keep their public education. This is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">So Europe is part of the solution and now we have to do everything we can to stabilise the euro area and to create the conditions for growth. But what growth? Sustainable growth! Not the growth of the past. The growth fuelled by excessive debt is not sustainable. The growth fuelled by irresponsible private credit is not sustainable, as we have seen.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to return to conditions for growth that is sustainable. This why the IMF, like the Commission, like the ECB, is in favour of fiscal consolidation. What the IMF said, and we can completely agree with this, is that the situation is different in some Member States and so those countries which have the margin to promote growth in terms of internal demand can do so, and in some cases there can be fine tuning of the objectives. Indeed I want to make it very clear that it was the Commission which proposed, and we were supported by the IMF, but it was the Commission which proposed one more year for Portugal and Spain to reach the budget consolidation targets. It was our proposal, not the IMF’s proposal. So, first for Spain and then for Portugal, the Commission recommended to the Council that the deadline for correction of excessive deficit be extended by one year.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fiscal rules, the revised Stability and Growth Pact, allow for this: when the economic situation turns out to be worse than expected and the reduction of the deficit in structural terms is taking place, an extension of the period to correct a nominal deficit can be granted. This is not automatic. The situation will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This was also the position of Madam Lagarde when she said <span class="italic">‘conseil nécessaire et possible’</span> which means in English: advice ‘when it is needed and possible’, and this is exactly the position taken by the institutions that are monitoring the situation in some of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, in the case of countries under financial assistance, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal, one must assess the consequences on that sustainability of a possible prolongation of an adjustment period. Prolonging the adjustment period can delay reversing the increase in the government’s debt ratio and put it on a declining trend. This in turn will delay the return of those countries to the market, possibly requiring extra financing, and then comes the question: are the other euro area countries – because decisions are taken by the governments – the Commission makes the proposal in the end but I want to make it clear that the decisions are taken ultimately by governments – are the euro area countries ready to provide extra financing? This is an important issue. This means that for programme countries the possible prolongation of the programmes is subject to the severe constraints stemming from high levels of debt. These are also in fact the views of the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, one thing it is important to note and which people have not paid sufficient attention to, is that some of those who are now saying that we should be more, let us say, flexible in terms of the fiscal targets, are exactly the same people as are proposing hard restructuring of debt; are exactly the same people as believe that the euro area is too big, that southern Europe should not in fact be in the euro area, that it was a mistake to have those countries in the euro area. This is exactly the point I want to make: we do not agree. We believe we should do everything we can to keep the integrity of the euro area because when you accept more flexibility in terms of fiscal adjustment you have to think what the consequences in terms of deficit stability will be and how we can keep those countries going to the market as soon as possible so that they can finance their own state. It is very important to understand this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why in fact I wanted to respond to those direct questions from you, to say that a lot remains to be done, but I believe that this European Council was an important moment for discussing the difficulties in a relatively open manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not underestimating in any way the difficulties and challenges ahead. I think we are now coming to a moment where, probably because there is less pressure coming from the markets, the sense of urgency in all of our capitals is not the same. That is why I expect Parliament and the Commission, as European institutions that keep firmly to the agenda, to understand that, without a complete comprehensive response to the euro area governance, we will not have the necessary conditions of confidence and confidence is critically important to restore investment and growth and jobs. This is our final and ultimate goal. Growth and jobs, but I repeat, sustainable growth for sustainable jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. − <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have said: ‘you need to act, you need to act now’. I have given you an overview of everything that we have done over the last two or three years, with which you are very familiar, and some of you have even said: ‘you have done a lot; now you need to act and implement your decisions’. We thus do not need to create new instruments, as some of you reiterated, before the instruments we already have are implemented. At the same time, we are told: ‘you need to act now’.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done – and I often say this – was inconceivable a year or two years ago. In fact, when it comes to the economic and monetary union, I must say – and you will also have seen this in Mrs Thyssen’s excellent report – that we have already made a great deal of progress on the economic union, on the budgetary union and even on the banking union. We have to intensify our efforts, but we have already made a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have underestimated, however – and I think we must all take the blame, both in the Member States and in the institutions – is the breadth, the depth and the seriousness of the crisis in some of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The loss of competitiveness and damage to the sustainability of the debt have been so severe that we need much more time to change course. We cannot think for a second that with a deficit of 15 %, as in one country, or a debt of 160 % we can escape the austerity policy. We cannot think that with deficits of 10 % to 15 % on the current accounts of other countries, we can escape a corrective policy, an amending policy, an austerity policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not imposed, first and foremost, by the European institutions, it is imposed by the reality of the situation; it is the consequence of maladministration in quite a few countries over a period of time. We did not act soon enough, neither in the Member States, nor collectively at European Union level. Therefore, the so-called austerity policy is not a policy imposed from above; it is a policy that was inevitable, completely inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have underestimated the breadth and the seriousness of the crisis. We have done many things over the last two or three years, and that is underestimated, too. We have not finished yet. That is why the four Presidents of the institutions are currently working on more initiatives. One of the key points, and something that we lacked, was sufficient financial integration.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of the financial crisis, we set up three or four institutions, of course, but they focused mainly on coordination. Now we need institutions that are much more European, that are shared more fully by all. In fact, what we are going to do now, with the single supervisory mechanism, is in some ways an unprecedented breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is serious work to be done. We took that decision in June. The Commission put forward its proposal in September and the October European Council laid down the broad guidelines to enable the ministers to complete the work. You, too, have a responsibility in terms of the implementation of this banking union and we hope – and it is an extremely ambitious timetable – to continue and complete the work by the end of the year. </p>
<p class="contents">Once the legislative framework has been determined, there is all of the operational work by the Central Bank to put this single supervisor in place, and that will take a number of months, too. Step by step, but with serious and continuous efforts, we are endeavouring to ensure that this first pillar of the banking union is a truly European pillar. We are told that we need to act. We are acting, but we are acting in a serious fashion, in a fashion that guarantees a certain level of quality.</p>
<p class="contents">If things are moving somewhat slowly, that is one of the reasons for it. We have done many things and we are in the process of doing things that, in relation to the past, are quite revolutionary, when we talk about certain new institutions that we are going to set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we reached the end? No. That is why we are going to work with December in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the work will be harder than we imagine, because now, after everything we have done – the six-pack, and let us hope that the two-pack will be implemented quickly, too – with the Treaty on Stability and the Stability and Growth Pact, with everything we have done on the financial assistance mechanisms, with everything we have done in all of these areas, now we are really getting to the core of sovereignty and the core of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The next stage will thus be a qualitative leap. It will also be a gradual process and I can assure you that the debate will not be straightforward here in this House, nor in the European Council, nor in other institutions. Indeed, the further we go, the harder it becomes to make further progress without touching on certain taboos relating to the concept of sovereignty and the concept of solidarity. I would warn you then that between October and December the work will be very difficult and we will have to take decisions that affect a number of taboos.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of a fifth building block, but the social dimension must form an integral part of every single policy. That is what we did with the Europe 2020 strategy. Mr Barroso and I fought to ensure that this fifth goal of combating poverty was approved. It was not easy; most of the Member States were totally opposed to it. However, we eventually incorporated it in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, what is the Compact for Growth and Jobs but an element of the social dimension? What is more social than trying to create jobs in extremely difficult circumstances? The social dimension can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The four building blocks that I have proposed are building blocks that are traditional in every economic and monetary union. Moreover, in the European Council, no Head of State or Government, of any ilk or any political leaning, has called them into question. Therefore, we will also work on this social dimension, as I have just said, within the framework of these four building blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The social policy is most important at Member State level. When the Member States take decisions on fiscal consolidation – and I was a finance minister for a very long time – they have to evaluate every measure in terms of its social impact. What is needed is a policy where the strongest shoulders bear the heaviest load. That is a general rule; but when it comes to implementing it and making it a reality, it is much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The social dimension is everywhere, both in the Member States and in the policies adopted at European level. Some people say: ‘we need to act now on growth’. Ladies and gentlemen, the monetary policy – and I do not want to pass judgment – is not a restrictive policy, when we see that the interest rates are, in practice, negative interest rates and that the Central Bank is providing liquidity to the tune of EUR 1 000 billion by the end of the year; EUR 1 000 billion! The monetary policy is by no means a restrictive policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budgetary policy is concerned, are we once again going to move to deficit spending? No! Where possible, however, we are going to make the path a little easier. We have done it for Spain and for Portugal, and we may do it for other countries, too.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, if we do not continue with these fiscal consolidation efforts, the markets will, unfortunately, punish these countries immediately. Everything that is gained by making the path a little easier will be lost immediately because of interest rate increases.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we do not have not dozens of different ways to generate economic growth in the very short term. The most important thing in the short term is to restore confidence in the euro area. That is more important than anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">If you do not mind, I will give you some figures because when you say something positive, you need to be careful because it is not really politically correct. If you look at the difference between the bond rates 10 years ago in most of our countries and the benchmark, which is the German interest rate, if you look at the current situation and compare it to the worst situation in the last 12 months, you will see a decrease: 239 points in Italy, 249 points in Spain, 800 points in Portugal, 900 points in Ireland and 270 points in Belgium. It is therefore not right to say that there have been no results.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these results last, and the difficult lesson here is, of course, that we have been wrong on several occasions in the past. Well, perhaps I am the only one who has been wrong and some of you are always right. In any case, I can get things wrong. This result is also a clear sign that we can make progress in terms of restoring confidence. If we continue like this, consumers and businesses will also gain in confidence and that will lead to an increase in growth, albeit too low, at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, and, indeed, we are starting to see the first signs of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Restoring confidence in the future of the euro area is the best way of promoting economic growth in the very short term.</p>
<p class="contents">This work will take place here and in the European Council, gradually, step by step. Each time, we are comparing completely new elements to the past. We will continue the work in December. In the meantime, I, like you, hope that in November we will reach an agreement on the multiannual framework. To do that, however, we need one thing, without which an agreement will be impossible: we need a sense of compromise and the political will for this to work. Without that, an agreement will not be possible. For our part, like the other Councils that I have chaired, we will make every effort to reach a compromise.</p>

I simply wish to remind my fellow Members of an event of major European significance that began on 23 October 1956. I am referring, of course, to the revolution in Hungary. Unfortunately, it is sometimes misused by extremists, such as today’s demonstrations by Jobbik and by Nick Griffin, a homophobic extremist from the British National Party. This was a major and very important event in European history, along with the Berlin uprising and the Prague Spring, of course. We should not let this day pass without remembering all those who fought bravely in a revolution which, tragically, was crushed by Soviet troops. Even so, it was an important symbol of freedom in Europe. As the European Union is now a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, it is important to commemorate this day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no public support for a bigger emergency fund, but is a new budget not a way to hoodwink our citizens? In Mr Van Rompuy’s proposal a separate budget for the eurozone comes down to ever more ‘Europeanisation’ of social policy. Calling for more Europe at a time of crisis threatens to trample subsidiarity under foot compared with economic, social and fiscal policy. Does the Council not recognise an area of tension here?

Access to finance is essential for financing business investment, to guarantee that they reach their full development potential and so to facilitate the creation of new enterprises that can generate growth and future jobs.

It is essential that we rebuild European competitiveness and encourage investment and job creation, as the number of unemployed in the EU is around 25 million. We therefore need a growth-oriented budget. It is also vital to restore confidence in the euro area and ensure the EU’s long-term stability, by guaranteeing economic convergence. However, it is not only EMU that needs a boost, but also the Union of citizens. The creation of a common European identity, in an area without internal borders, is under threat. We have to urgently reach compromises in this area, too, as the Europe of which we want to be proud is not limited to the common market, but goes further, by prioritising people within European policies. I regret that, in all of these areas, the Council has simply repeated previous decisions and postponed others, which does not give hope to Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To reduce the vicious circle of increasing interest rates, the lowering of ratings and liquidity problems, we need more than just measures; we also need a framework that will force the banking sector to become sustainable and responsible when faced with speculative tendencies.

The contradictions surrounding the banking supervision mechanism and direct financing of the European Stability Mechanism by the banks are a clear example of this.

Swaying between gloating and sincere concern, almost everyone agreed on one thing: that there was an evident delay, an increasing lack of clarity and a feeling of a lack of political will. Today we can view matters with more optimism because a decisive step has been taken towards the introduction of a single banking supervisory mechanism. I am very pleased that its development was announced as a priority and that a deadline was fixed for reaching an agreement for its legislative framework, that is, 1 January 2013. There is no doubt now that the European banking union will be realised. Its new, stricter rules will give security to citizens and increase confidence in the markets. However, I must reiterate: the ease with which some leaders make references to the inevitability of splitting Europe into a ‘two-speed’ Europe is frightening. The European banking union and subsequent fiscal union will form the future not only of the eurozone countries but of the entire EU, and their success will depend on everybody, not just the countries that are directly involved in the euro crisis today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk about different unions: economic, monetary, banking and political. We establish new mechanisms, authorities and agencies. Summit follows summit. Some time ago, a strategy paper was adopted on Europe 2020. Meanwhile work has also been ongoing on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 and on reforms to the main policies. For the average EU citizen, the sheer number of initiatives and actions is often confusing. In my opinion, three objectives are the most important right now. First of all, reaching an agreement on the future financial framework in order to ensure the stability of the EU and financing for growth measures under the EU budget from 2014. Secondly, a single banking authority should be set up that will strengthen the banking system in Europe and help establish a banking union. Sound and effective banking will create the conditions for the much-desired growth. We must ultimately make sure that there is no repeat of a situation in which a crisis within financial institutions and the collapse of banks become the cause of a financial, and subsequently economic, crisis, with huge sums allocated from national budgets in order to rescue these institutions. Thirdly, more robust economic management and budgetary supervision and coordination in the Member States must go hand in hand with deeper structural reforms and greater productivity and competitiveness. These measures will help strengthen the EU politically, as an efficient structure bolstered by economic integration and essential reforms designed to tackle the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as banks in countries outside the eurozone are concerned, the possibility of joining the banking union and applying community regulations is a given, but they will not be able to share in the resources of the planned bank rescue fund. Meanwhile, the countries of the eurozone will be able to offer financial support on a contractual basis to less competitive members for the purpose of structural reforms, while this possibility is not available to countries outside the eurozone. It is becoming increasingly clear that the rules of the common market are being shaped according to the demands of the eurozone, quite simply because the countries outside the eurozone are in the minority (EU17-EU10). Participation in deepening integration is vital to the interests of small, open economies such as Hungary that are stuck outside the eurozone. Being stuck on the outside will mean a steady decline in their ability to service national debt and attract vital capital into the country to ensure a functioning banking system, finance development and enhance competitiveness. It is high time that Mr Orbán’s Government abandoned its freedom-fighter economic policy, which runs directly counter to the European mainstream. It is a policy that will mean the ruin of the Hungarian economy and leave the country lagging behind in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, reference was also made to the difficult economic and financial situation of Greece. I support the new Compact for Growth and Jobs being rapidly implemented to the tune of EUR 120 billion, the capital of the European Investment Bank being increased by EUR 10 billion, trans-European networks in the area of energy and transport being adopted, and the internal market being extended or the amounts for research and innovation or industrial competitiveness being increased. I am therefore critical of the lack of agreement between the Member States on the entry into force of economic and monetary union, with the decision having been made that the European Central Bank will not extend its responsibilities for supervising all European banks until next year. I would also stress that, if any Member State in receipt of external financial support manages to make the adjustment period more flexible, or if the bank recapitalisation amounts do not influence the budget deficit, all of the other countries should be entitled to receive exactly the same treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not enough progress has been made in implementing economic growth and job creation as agreed in June and therefore we ask for firm, rapid and result-oriented measures. We ask the Commission to support the Member States in the process of reprogramming their structural funds so that they can be strongly focused on economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The competitiveness of the EU and its economic and social development depend on ensuring a modern and efficient infrastructure for transport, energy and information and communication technology. The Connecting Europe Facility will help deal with bottlenecks and the problems with cross-border connections in trans-European transport, finalise the internal market for energy and create a fully functioning digital single market by 2015. All this will promote research and development and improve the competitive edge of EU industries as they contribute to growth and to the creation and preservation of jobs within the EU.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want real answers from the leaders of the Union to the questions from the thousands of workers at Ford Genk who are threatened with redundancy, and to the concerns of the ‘lost generation’ of 14 million young people in the EU who are not in education, employment or training. These young people, who will have to take the future of the Union into their hands, have nothing to do, are powerless and have lost all belief in the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is cultivating a generation of mistrust which feeds populist and nationalist tendencies that encourage Europeans to retreat to the little islands that are their Member States. We really must go for a social pact in Europe. What we mainly see now is that the Union continues to blunder about in the economic margin by blunting the sharp edges of the misappropriation of the unregulated market a bit, without really looking to the future, giving hope to young Europeans and developing a real vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
