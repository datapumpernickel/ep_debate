<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to start by explaining exactly what we are discussing. We are dealing with the economic guidelines, and in my view, there are three novel aspects to them. Firstly, they are economic guidelines for three years, not just for one year. Secondly, they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines. Thirdly, we are holding these discussions at a time of recession. We have learnt this morning that the most powerful economy in the European Union has entered into recession. These are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and myself in particular, were requested to draft a report promptly to allow the Commission and the Council to study it. We were asked to try and arrive at the broadest possible consensus. We have achieved this. All the groups had to make compromises but we did manage to reach an agreement. I should like to take this opportunity of highlighting the splendid work of the spokespersons for the various groups. Othmar Karas spoke on behalf of my group, Robert Goebbels spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Carles-Alfred Gasòliba i Böhm spoke on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to the Commission that whenever Parliament has been invited to respond, the response has invariably been helpful. As suggested in the Poem of the Cid, a servant will always respond well to a good master. I urge you to bear this in mind and to involve Parliament in the discussion of these economic guidelines. Amongst other things, this discussion will serve to put pressure on the Member States lagging furthest behind.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now outline the key points of my report. Firstly, we want to know whether the current coordination mechanisms are adequate, or whether further measures are needed. We understand that the Treaty states that national policies, supply policies and short-term policies are policies of common interest and should be coordinated. We are now three years behind with the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Whenever the Commissioner appears before us, he states that the delay is due to lack of application and due diligence on the part of the Member States We wish to do more than simply wring our hands. We would like to suggest appropriate action to remedy these failures concerning implementation. We have two proposals in this regard. We would ask the Commission once and for all to draw up a list detailing the rigidities hindering implementation of the internal market and structural change. This list should also detail priorities, measures required and the calendar for meeting the Lisbon objectives by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming that lack of due diligence on the part of the Member States is the reason for this delay, we call upon the Commission to explain to us what it could do to remedy the situation. Once upon a time there was a Spanish constitution stating that Spaniards should be fair and charitable. Unfortunately this constitution did not contain any provisions detailing how such a transformation was to be achieved. Subsequently, Spain endured three civil wars during the nineteenth century. We call for coordination to guarantee that all economic policies are going in the same direction. That is what coordination is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to stress that I believe wholeheartedly in maintaining balanced budgetary positions. There is no need to change things that are working well just because other things are not. Monetary policy has worked well during this period. This policy is aimed at achieving price stability. It is managed through an independent bank and a Stability Pact that has maintained only a certain degree of discipline in the Member States. I stress that there has only been a certain degree of discipline. Some States have gone significantly astray. I would therefore like to reiterate my conviction that budgetary balance must remain the objective. As the Commission stated, those extravagant countries will have to reduce their structural deficit by half a percent of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, convergence programs should be assessed differently, as the Commission itself highlighted. The Commission has to verify that budgets are balanced. It also has to check carefully to ensure Member States do not exceed the 3% limit. In future, the Commission ought to take account of each Member State’s starting point. It ought to take account of each country’s debt and of how it plans to use resources obtained. It ought also to take account of the country’s anticipated future commitments. Take the case of a country which is not in debt, which plans to allocate money to public finances, notably to measures promoting the Lisbon strategy, and which does not have significant commitments for the future. The case of a country where these circumstances do not apply is entirely different.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Commission to ensure that Member States build up a budgetary reserve when times are good, or, to use a Biblical image, when the cows are fat. Such a reserve could be drawn on in bad times. We stress that countries should also reduce taxes whenever possible. In particular, we advocate a reduction in taxes increasing labour costs, as this would stimulate employment. Countries that cannot afford to reduce taxes should introduce supplementary measures. They should reduce public spending or increase income in other ways. It is impossible to maintain a balanced budget and reduce taxes at the same time. You cannot have your cake and eat it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the policy on wages, we advocate keeping wages in line with the Retail Price Index. We believe actual wages should be in line with productivity. We advocate increasing labour mobility. In addition, we call on the Commission to speed up work on eliminating the fiscal barriers hindering the transfer of employment pensions. We further call on the Commission to establish an appropriate fiscal policy to complement the agreement reached on pensions. We appeal for social dialogue. Allow me to reiterate that we would like to see fiscal incentives for employment. We call for a reduction of the burdens that make employers unwilling to take on staff, especially those on the lowest wages.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to policies on investment, we are aware it has frequently been said we are lagging behind the United States because of lack of investment, especially in technology. We are also aware that we are more or less on a par with the United States in terms of public investment. Under investment occurs in the private sector. We therefore call for a benchmarking exercise to pinpoint the various needs, inadequacies and shortcomings of those companies. This is particularly relevant if small and medium-sized companies, with less than nine employees, are to access new technologies. Resources can only be allocated efficiently if the full picture is clear. We just need to know how things stand. We would like the Commission to report on this promptly. After all, to paraphrase a Spanish poet, there is no such thing as a favourable wind for a sailor who has not yet set his course. All we are requesting is a report to identify inadequacies and deficiencies in SMEs. It would then be possible to establish how best to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking all the groups and their spokespersons for their efforts. Once again, the Commission can be assured that Parliament is ready, willing and able to help overcome the difficult situation we find ourselves in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank all those Members of Parliament involved for their active cooperation in its production.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we are launching a new venture. It differs substantially from our activities in previous years. For the first time, the broad guidelines of economic policy cover a three-year period. The Commission recommendations on these guidelines are based on the fundamental principles established at the 2003 Brussels European Council. As Mr García-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it is also the first time these guidelines are being put forward alongside the broad guidelines on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time too, a number of changes to the broad guidelines of economic policy have been included. We believe these changes are crucial. The general part of the guidelines has been drastically cut. We believe now is the time to focus more effectively on priorities. We have defined the specific guidelines for each country in a more precise and systematic manner. It is also the first time a specific reference to the Eurozone has been included.</p>
<p class="contents">As is only to be expected, the economic strategy built into the guidelines of economic policy is based on the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council. The García-Margallo y Marfil report contains some criticism of the broad economic guidelines. It alleges they are not sufficiently ambitious. In my opinion this criticism is not justified. The broad guidelines relate well to the agreements reached at Lisbon. It is also true that we are aiming at commitments that can be defined and assessed more effectively. I agree with Mr García-Margallo y Marfil on this, and will comment later on his idea for a specific action plan. The underlying problem however is not devising new plans, but implementing what we have already agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we also need to take account of the particular situation we are in at the moment. We need to deal with the difficulties posed by the cyclical conditions. Mr García-Margallo y Marfil emphasised this. I also agree however that we should not set aside the fundamental elements of our strategy just because we are currently in a somewhat difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our strategy is based on three key ideas: healthy macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and sustainable processes. As regards healthy macroeconomic policies, I think we all agree that achieving budgetary balance is essential. I also agree with Mr García-Margallo y Marfil that it is especially important to guard against repeating past mistakes. The latter entailed implementing polices promoting cyclical economic patterns thus storing up problems for the future. The Commission outlined its concern over this problem in its communication last November. We pointed to the need to implement the Stability and Growth Pact during the good periods of the economic cycle, not just during the bad ones. This is essential if we want to avoid subsequent problems. In short, we are seeking to establish a sound policy and allow automatic stabilisers do their job.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the potential for growth, I completely agree that the necessary structural reforms should be implemented. These are key to ensuring the economy of the European Union stands up better to external fluctuations. Nonetheless, if these reforms are to be effective they must be all-embracing and applied jointly. We fully agree on the need to increase employment. The difficulty concerns whether we need to implement specific employment incentives or whether it would be better to draw up a general economic policy with employment as its objective. We think the latter is the best option.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, you said that one of your concerns was the implementation of an action plan on structural reform. You asked two questions. Firstly, you asked why we do not have a list of structural reforms. Secondly, you asked why we are not using mechanisms to monitor these reforms more effectively. In my opinion, the list of structural reforms is contained in the Lisbon conclusions. Our yearly progress reports are contained in the summary reports. It also true that it falls to Member States to implement them. Establishing another new plan would not resolve the problems. We believe we already have the plans. We know what we need to do. I feel the crucial issue is how we implement these plans. We therefore think we should focus on two essential aspects of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are the yearly reports issued by the Commission on the application of the broad economic guidelines of economic policy. The main idea behind moving from one to three years is to focus more on the application of annual principles, and less on their definition. Another reason was to place greater emphasis on the peer pressure system established in the European Union. This is a key aspect of the coordination of economic policies. You raised an important issue, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil. You queried whether or not this is sufficient. I believe that it is sufficient if we can count on political agreement on the part of the Member States to apply joint decisions. We must remember that the system of coordinating economic policy consists of coordinating national economic policies based on a Community system. We must also remember that peer pressure is the only way we have of implementing this. The sole exceptions are the recommendations we use to identify certain failures and, of course, the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards improving sustainability, the importance of public debt is worth noting. I agree with you on the need to focus on this issue and we are paying special attention to it. We think it is essential to provide for future obligations by setting aside assets beforehand. We also feel it is crucial to ensure a greater and better use of natural resources. Consequently any form of sectoral subsidy resulting in a less efficient system in environmental terms must be given careful consideration. Similarly, sustainability and social cohesion must be considered as objectives of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer briefly to another proposal presented in your draft involving a Lisbon implementation plan. I think we share your disquiet. The Commission has made it clear that it is concerned about the failure to implement the decisions taken at Lisbon. Clearly, implementation is behind schedule. Once again, however, I do not feel that the solution lies in devising new plans. Rather, I believe we must move ahead more speedily with what we have already decided. Political will is essential for this. So too is Parliament’s support. The positions adopted in this House will be crucial to the success of all the efforts required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is, however, one point to which allusion has already been made and which it is important to underline from the outset. We have an internal market concept, we have the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, we have European competition policy, we have the Financial Services Action Plan and the Risk Capital Action Plan, we have Article 2, which obliges Member States to pursue a course of economic policy coordination, we have the Stability and Growth Pact, we have the euro, we have EU enlargement and hence the expansion of the internal market into a home market, and we have the eco-social market economy as our model of economic governance, which means competitiveness within a free market, promoting social cohesion while being mindful of its responsibility towards nature and people. Should not all this be enough to put us in a better position than we are in? Why do we need new economic policy guidelines? We need them because we have no European employment policy, because we have no European economic policy, and because the task of implementing all the various decisions that we jointly adopt is therefore primarily a matter for the Member States and because many Member States fail to do their homework. Half-heartedness, superficiality, a lack of courage, and complacency, indeed, insincerity about many of the key issues on the Community's agenda shape the picture. There is a lack of ambition and a lack of political will. Let me say this here today: new economic policy guidelines are no substitute for political will, for the willingness to act instead of apportioning blame, and for greater commitment and a willingness to accept responsibility for all these issues. We need more European thinking instead of wrong-headed national egotism.</p>
<p class="contents">There can therefore be only one message sent out from here today, and it is this: we need a benchmark. Who is the best, the most creative, the fastest, the most successful in implementing common decisions? It is results that matter, not guidelines or a succession of summits. It is the successes, not the means of achieving them, that matter, and we must therefore do our utmost to implement what we have agreed. We need fresh impetus, new and courageous efforts, more own capital, more risk capital, and a climate that favours business start-ups. We must strengthen the internal market and remove distortions of competition. We must introduce majority voting on matters relating to taxation and harmonise all business taxes in Europe. We need more competitiveness, more research, more competition in education and research, and more competition on merits. If we finally do what we all pledge to do at all the summit meetings, Europe will not only be the world's number one in terms of its population and area, but also in terms of competitiveness and employment.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trentin (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr García Margallo’s report, which I consider to be an important contribution to the development of effective coordination of the Union’s economic and social policies, starkly exposes the<span class="bold"> </span>shortcomings which have characterised the drawing up of the broad economic and social policy guidelines in recent years. On the one hand, there has for too long been no attempt to establish a proactive policy that can combat the trends towards stagnation and recession which are still raging through many of the Union’s economies. On the other hand, to say the least, the principle of streamlining and coordinating employment policies through the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines has been belatedly recognised. Moreover, the goal of achieving the strategy laid down in Lisbon in 2000 and the related structural reforms by 2010 has been included in what seems as yet to be a rather ill-defined fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not underestimate the progress made, but it must be stressed that we now need to overcome the delays and ambiguities, providing for effective coordination of Member States’ economic, employment and environment policies by establishing a proper calendar setting out the intermediate steps for achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives by 2010, particularly with regard to public investment in the research, education and lifelong training sectors and a European network of essential services, starting with transport and telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we also need to set up an institutional coordinating structure in the euro area so that – as stated in Mr García Margallo’s report – the euro area has a single representative in all the international economic and financial institutions. Lastly, we need, for the euro area too, to define the phases of an economic, social and environment policy which is also compatible with the Lisbon strategy and with flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">As of 2004, these measures should become the core of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new goals for enhancing flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this regard, I would stress that we need to avoid general formulae and great ambiguity: not all economic policies can both satisfy the Lisbon and Gothenburg criteria and respect the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of public deficit and government debt, even in the event that the Pact is managed more flexibly, as proposed by the Commission – whose efforts we appreciate – particularly in this current phase of virtual stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission cannot ignore the fact that a discrepancy of 3% with regard to the minimum objective of 60% of government debt is due to an increase in current expenditure, or maybe to tax cuts across the board, or to a policy of boosting public and private investment – for example, in research, in training, in retraining workers of retirement age who wish to continue working – especially considering that such investment is recognised, formally recognised, by the Commission itself as an objective of common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The same priorities should be pursued, as Commissioner Solbes said, in periods of growth too, when the conditions are created for greater compatibility between the broad economic and employment policy guidelines and the parameters of the Stability Pact, which is also – and the Central Bank itself must not forget this – a Pact which should seek to increase income and employment and, after Lisbon, to bring about full employment and social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe it rightly emphasises the importance of providing a more appropriate framework to ensure that the objectives set in the various stability pacts and the main broad guidelines of economic policy are attained. The stability and credibility of the Union’s economy and its single currency are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days we have become very much aware of social unrest resulting from essential proposals to reform pensions systems. Reform is needed to guarantee pensions and associated benefits. These are integral parts of the welfare state system characteristic of the European Union. The Union provides and guarantees the best social protection and the greatest social balance when compared to other large economies.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is to preserve that balance, the European Union must make a more determined effort to take the action many have called for in recent times. During the preparations for the Spring European Council in Brussels under the current Greek Presidency, we highlighted two shortcomings. The first was failure to attain the Lisbon objectives. The second concerned the need to tackle a number of outstanding structural reforms mentioned in Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report. Action on these is certainly needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate the importance of this area. It encompasses a number of unresolved key issues which are therefore still holding back economies and their development at European level. Liberalisation of some sectors is one area where action is outstanding. Another is failure to adopt technological innovation. Research and development is not being promoted adequately either. Further, as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it has now become urgent to give priority to SMEs, especially to those with the most potential for growth and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that large corporations tend to shed jobs when times are hard. This is happening at the moment. It is actually the SMEs that create more employment and stimulate economic recovery. I would emphasise once again that such recovery must take place within a strict framework and budgetary balance. It is also essential to attain the objectives set in the stability pacts. These are an integral part of the framework on which the European Union and the euro are based and from which they will develop. We cannot afford to restrict or weaken it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Herman (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I am the rapporteur for the report on the Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States. The idea was for us also to have voted on that report today. For the first time, we would have seen economic and employment policy guidelines coordinated in terms of time, but that was unfortunately not to be the case. As rapporteur, I pulled out all the stops so that we should be ready in time, but to no avail. It means that this report will not be presented until the June part-session, and by then it will be too late. It means that the Council will decide on the guidelines on the same day that we vote in Parliament, and the Council will not therefore be able to take account of our points of view. That is serious because it means that the important balance between the two processes will go to pot. Instead, the economic perspective will totally dominate. It is a shift we also see elsewhere in political life. It bodes well neither for the Lisbon process nor for the social Europe in which so many Europeans have placed their hopes and confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU now finds itself in a difficult economic situation, with weak demand, low levels of investment and growing unemployment in ever more Member States. What was of course needed was a clear overhaul of the economic guidelines, but the Commission continues, unfortunately, to support the Stability and Growth Pact and budget discipline and to believe in the possibility of saving our way out of the crisis. If, through having a common currency, it is not permitted to increase state expenditure and there is no possibility of regulation by means of flexible exchange rates, only the labour market remains. The measures proposed by the Commission are therefore concerned not so much with economics as with the labour market. It is a question first and foremost of reducing labour costs and the attendant social costs, but that leads to a reduction in domestic demand, which is incredibly important. That, of course, is what needs to be increased if we are not to enter a vicious circle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact was duly created in order to keep inflation under control during a period of growth when there was a perhaps justified anxiety about inflation. Today, the situation is different. Now, the same Pact is instead giving rise to deflation and growing unemployment. The policy of economic and monetary union binds all the eurozone countries to a common fate and to a policy of cut-backs leading to a type of collective decline. ‘United we stand and united we fall’, the refrain might go. It means, on the other hand, that those countries are well placed that are able to say no to the euro and to remain outside the policy of economic and monetary union. My own country, Sweden, is to hold a referendum on EMU in September, and, with each month that goes by, opposition to the euro is growing, both among the general public and among economic and political experts.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe it would be infinitely better to continue with the Lisbon policy and to pin our faith in investment in skills, knowledge and innovation. Ideally, we need comprehensive public investment programmes strategically designed so as to strengthen demand both for products and services from the private market and for training, research and other such things that increase knowledge. That is the way forward, and if the actors in the market do not themselves succeed in meeting these requirements, it is we politicians who must create the conditions that induce companies to dare to think in the long term. It is impossible to save our way out of the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bouwman (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, rapporteurs, today it was the intention to have a joint debate on both the global economic guidelines and the employment guidelines. The rapporteur for these employment guidelines of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stated a moment ago that we have a problem. Not only are we trying to simplify the guidelines, not only are we here to talk about a three-year period, but we are also trying, as they say, to 'streamline' them. We have not managed to do this. This is very unfortunate since the broad and global economic guidelines in the text to a large extent refer to the employment guidelines which are yet to be discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems are patently clear, and in the light of these problems – some people in the Netherlands say that every disadvantage has its advantage – in the light of these circumstances, we have held emergency talks with the Council and the Commission in order to alleviate this problem we have, namely the inability to submit our opinion on the employment guidelines on time. The Council has promised that, in the next few years, the consultation period will be longer, and the Commission has also promised that it will submit its proposals more quickly. Both have pledged this in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, there is still a problem in my view. As Mr Schmid has already pointed out, we are unable to commit to deadlines in certain areas. This means that we need to inform both the Commission and the Council of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in a more informal manner as and when we can and, at a later stage, of the opinions of the plenary too. I would mention the fact that, since there were 167 amendments to the employment guidelines, some restraint is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few comments on the broad economic guidelines and particularly those employment guidelines. As some speakers have mentioned already, we are at the moment talking about both long-term policy – which could be referred to as the Lisbon policy, 2010 – and short term policy, and, in the short term, we are facing a recession, as we were reminded a moment ago. During a recession such as this, there is no longer a labour shortage, but rather a job shortage. This means that employment guidelines should be more dynamic in the short term and should also be more country-specific in a number of ways. This job shortage also translates into a shortage of work placement and work experience places. Neither does it offer any incentives to solve the poverty problems. Reintegration is said to be adversely affected and the concept of availability comes under pressure. Financial incentives that are being mentioned here are more limited and will not immediately have the desired effect on the poverty trap and the promotion of jobs. In fact, what we need to do in the short term is to consider job sharing again. Issues that are very much on the agenda and which I should like to emphasise are working shorter hours, options to cut down the number of hours, the reduction of overtime, which is currently growing rapidly, and possibly promoting subsidised work and social economy or the third sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, entrepreneurship should be stimulated. In our committee, a number of proposals have already been expressed in the form of compromise proposals in order to stimulate the small and medium-size businesses, and they strongly emphasise the fact that the pillar of equality has taken a knock. We should like to maintain this equality. This does mean, however, as the Belgian Employment Minister has already pointed out, that certain target groups, such as the elderly, should perhaps be pleased with the fact that they can enjoy their early retirement at the moment. This is the subject of political debate. We will bring our proposals to the next meetings and we will take it from there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For those like myself from countries within the eurozone it is clear that the constant decline of the euro vis-à-vis the United States dollar is causing considerable problems for our exporters. All of this at a time when the global economy is already facing many uncertainties. Rather than dwelling on the current difficulties and becoming doom and gloom merchants, we need to take a positive approach and I commend our rapporteur for his approach in this regard. I fully share his conviction that the European economy is one which urgently needs a new approach to economic policy making.</p>
<p class="contents">This year's broad economic policy guidelines cover a three-year period and a new streamline procedure within the European employment guidelines has been put in place. I very much welcome this. I would hope that this integrated and longer-term planning perspective will bring about the desired level of economic policy coordination between the Member States. At the same time it is important that each Member State government fulfils its duty to react to the particular set of circumstances in that Member State and uses those policy instruments open to it to boost competitiveness, employment and the national economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit's decision to set up a special employment taskforce in this regard is welcome. While the successful completion of the enlargement process is clearly being focused upon by all institutions, we must avoid becoming too inward-looking in the Union. The newly-enlarged market will add a new impetus in terms of investment opportunities and labour mobility to the whole competitiveness agenda. I sincerely hope that forthcoming presidencies will take this view and prioritise those areas of the Lisbon Agenda where further progress is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion of enforcement powers for the Commission smacks of a centralist approach to economic development that has long become obsolete as our new Member States from central and eastern Europe can testify. I doubt if any of the ten new Member State governments would take kindly to the idea that their national budget must be vetted in Brussels, rather than in their own national parliaments. I would be opposed to any proposal to bestow economic governance powers on the EU in the context of the forthcoming Treaty revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in the context of this debate, it is proper to put down a marker to make it clear that attempts to create a federalist EU, as distinct from a confederation of Member States, must be strongly resisted. The EU is unique in this respect and our goal and vision must continue to be a Union of Europe of the Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it was one year ago yesterday that we held a debate on the global economic policy guidelines in this plenary. During this debate, I made some critical remarks about the economic policy guidelines. I indicated that the promises were very rarely kept. To my chagrin, I have to say that little has been done with this criticism since. It is therefore logical that the same criticism should now also apply to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we already saw a decline in economic growth. We now have to conclude that, despite fine policy intentions, recovery is still not on the cards. It appears that, with the policy guidelines, which form an open coordination method, we in the European Union are unable to cope with an impending recession. In addition, the objectives of the Lisbon process do not appear achievable with the current instruments. In short, the transposition of the policy intentions under implementation and the implementation of the guidelines leave something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I have gleaned from various sources that an open coordination method does not work. In practice, this method is apparently too non-committal and is also not very well-defined. Consequently, cooperation by means of the open coordination method is not sufficiently binding upon the Member States. It would therefore be useful if it were made clear in what way the Member States can work together in the field of employment and social policy, obviously thereby taking into consideration the Member States' responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put a question to the European Commission, and specifically Commissioner Solbes, in this connection. Can you indicate whether, and if so when, you will be tabling proposals in order to improve cooperation within the framework of the Lisbon process? In this respect, do you deem it possible to come up with a clear definition of the open coordination method in the short term?</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago at the Stockholm Summit, it was decided to aim for integration of environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines. This was with the intention to establish a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union. At present, economic prospects are uncertain, which has an impact on the creation of a sustainable and social market economy. I should therefore like to bring two important points to your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, social policy. In the debate on social policy, the European model is compared to the American model. The European model is based on solidarity, while the American model is not. The question is now to what extent this solidarity is still reflected in the policy which the Union is wishing to adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to draw your attention to the need for integrating environmental policy into economic policy. In my view, there is too little attention paid to the environmental aspects of economic policy. It seems that the integration of economic and social policy is more obvious than integrating environmental policy into economic policy. Might the reason lie in the fact that environmental policy costs money initially and does not lead to profits that are readily measurable? I would therefore welcome, alongside references to the importance of the environment, clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the economic policy guidelines. Objectives with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions spring to mind in this respect. Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources. Moreover, I consider taking active government measures aimed at increasing birth rates in Europe in a bid to keep pension schemes affordable extremely debatable.</p>
<p class="contents">Since both the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and this debate are critical about the global guidelines, it is time that the European Commission took these comments to heart. We, as the European Parliament, will need to ensure that economic policy is implemented in a consistent manner. The Commission must be pro-active and must inform Parliament in good time about the results achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can see why, but I believe that there lies the limit of our work and, ultimately, also one of the limitations of the BEPGs as such. It is easy to support the Lisbon objectives – who would not agree on these objectives – but what is difficult is to agree on the instruments. If you were members of a national parliament, Mr President, Mr Trentin, it would ultimately be a hard task to achieve consensus on the choices to be made and the positions to be adopted. I believe that this – but we know that now, it is an intrinsic problem<span class="bold"> </span>– is the limitation of these major guidelines and the open coordination policies, particularly because I feel we need to have the courage to go further on some issues, making decisions rather than seeking the lowest common denominator of different positions held within Parliament and by the different Member States, and getting to the heart of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention three points, which I feel receive insufficient emphasis in both the BEPGs and the report. The first is pension provision. Let this be understood – and we must shout it out loud and clear – there are going to be generations of poor pensioners in Europe and we are not doing anything about it because we do not want, we are not strong enough or courageous enough to impose certain choices on those who stand to benefit from pension systems not changing in due time. We have systems which are financially unsustainable, whose treatment of the younger and future generations is wicked, and yet we cannot muster the political will to change the situation. The issue would cause a heated debate even in Parliament. We have witnessed the strike in Austria, we have witnessed the strike in France and there will soon be a strike in Italy. The <span class="italic">status quo</span> lobby upholding the interests of those seeking to prevent any changes in the field of pensions is powerful and active. I believe that the European Parliament’s documents and statements too must call strongly for protection of the interests of all, especially the youngest citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, which is, moreover, valuable, Mr García-Margallo calls for social dialogue. I believe that, where an issue such as pensions is concerned, what is needed is not dialogue but a social debate instead and, where necessary, a political debate too. The pensions dialogue with the people filling the squares in Vienna, Paris or Rome, where the people’s fear is exploited with demagogic proposals when they know full well that something needs to be done, is a sterile dialogue, a dialogue that can lead nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: immigration. Although I can think of an amendment which I hope will not be supported by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I hope that the reference will be retained in the report to the important role played by immigrants and immigration in increasing the dynamism and flexibility of the European economy at precisely the time when, with enlargement, some of the larger countries are calling for the introduction of the free movement of workers to be postponed until 2011. The free movement of workers will contribute greatly to the dynamism of the European economy and the reference must be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with one last point, Mr President: the Lisbon goals, making the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy. We must ask ourselves how that will be possible in countries such as the European countries which reject the cutting-edge technology of GMOs and stem cells. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">status quo</span> is not really an option for European governments. In order to prepare for the overall as well as the budgetary effects of ageing populations we have to increase employment, reduce public debt and reform pensions and health care systems. The additional costs that would result from postponing the pension system reforms will in the future be taken out of the pockets of today’s youth. Change, even change that is necessary and inevitable, always meets with resistance, which is what we have also experienced this week in Strasbourg. This resistance to change, however, cannot be allowed to become a pretext for delaying necessary reforms or a barrier to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s economic situation is worrying and our economic growth is clearly poorer than what was forecast. Avoidance of geopolitical risks now gives us some hope of faster economic growth, but numerous experts are also pointing out that in forecasts made in the last two years faster economic growth has always been put off until the following six-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">Our poor economic growth is largely home-made: ‘made in Europe’<span class="italic">. </span>Ladies and gentlemen, sluggish growth, falling productivity, a decrease in external demand, a decline in business and consumer confidence, and the continued rise in unemployment are facts of life this year. The only positive factor is the low rate of inflation, which has averaged around 2% and will possibly fall even further.</p>
<p class="contents">At their summit meetings the heads of our Member States have promised to implement structural reforms allowing growth and stability. The extent to which this has been done in practical terms, however, has been inadequate, and poor economic growth and mass unemployment are the price we pay for putting off these reforms. If we want the broad guidelines of economic policies to have a successful outcome they should incorporate a clear work programme which defines the main areas of action for reform and a timetable for completion. In addition, the guidelines should list the special actions which are needed in those areas where internal political ‘stalemate ’ has obstructed progress in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is still characterised by its under-utilisation of human resources. Our employment rate, which is low when viewed in the international context, is also due to the misconceived incentives embedded in our benefit systems, which are conducive to withdrawal from the labour market or remaining outside it. Tax and benefit systems should be reformed, for example, by reducing excessively high rates of tax for those on low incomes. Tax reductions, however, should be made for everyone in paid employment. More flexible arrangements for working time and less stringent regulatory systems would enhance participation in the labour market and improve employment opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact is that actual economic conditions in the United States bear less and less relation to the dominant political discourse in Europe.

<p class="contents">In fact, despite a very flexible labour market, the official rate of unemployment has just reached 6% in the United States. It thus exceeds that of more than half of the Member States of the European Union. This official unemployment figure of 6% does not reflect the reality as a whole. The United States keeps two million people in prison, and that is another form of unemployment. Moreover, the definition of unemployment is particularly restrictive since it takes no account of all those Americans who are not actively in search of jobs. According to the American Ministry of Labour’s figures for March 2003, out of a total population of 290 million people, some 74 million adults were out of work in the United States, approximately 18 million of whom were officially unemployed and some 56 million of whom remained outside the labour market. This latter figure represents an increase of approximately five million since President Bush came to power.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United States, job creation was particularly vigorous in the area of what are called ‘face-to-face’ services, that is to say services not subject to international competition, such as the health sector, education, supermarket retailing, hotels, catering and entertainment of all kinds. All these sectors prosper thanks to consumers who spend on credit. Private debt in the United States at present exceeds 120% of GDP, that is to say the incredible sum of USD 13 000 billion. Stronger growth in the US is the result of the country’s private and public deficits. The American trade deficit with the rest of the world at present exceeds 5.5% of GDP. Foreign debt in the United States at present amounts to more than USD 3 000 billion. The American budget deficit, calculated on the basis of European criteria, also exceeds five per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">Superior growth in the United States is in fact a consequence of deficit spending.</p>
<p class="contents">The greater productivity to be found in the United States is the result of a more generous policy of national and regional development than is to be found in Europe. The greatest increases in productivity are linked to shopping malls and other forms of green field investment<span class="italic">,</span> a policy with which Europe, with its larger population, could never compete. Nonetheless, Europe is certainly no less productive than the United States. In 2002, the European Union had a share of world markets practically double that of the United States. Ought we really to follow the American example, Commissioner? Ought we not to set ourselves other objectives, that is to say a policy of stability that is less ideological and more pragmatic? Ought we not to admit that, at a time of soft recession, it is necessary to invest in research and development and in infrastructure and, therefore, not to sacrifice future expenditure, as Europe is doing at present? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This situation requires a new approach to drafting economic policy decisions in order to achieve the aims of high growth, full employment, sustainable development and greater social cohesion. The only problem is that, when confronted with the evidence, the answer is unfortunately always the same: speed up the process of liberalisations and structural reforms, as recommended in the Lisbon strategy – an approach that the employers’ representatives welcome so wholeheartedly – wage moderation and sticking to labour flexibility and job instability. Let us be clear about this: the rapporteur’s amendments accept and support the guidelines proposed by the Commission. The rapporteur himself acknowledges that these guidelines are a repetition of previous recommendations, but what is being called a new approach is only ‘more of the same’, with even greater intensity when what is crucial is to find a new direction. We would need to propose a total change to the liberal shift of the EU’s economic and social guidelines. We must also ask ourselves about the causes of this situation and the answer to this question can be found in the policies that have been pursued to date. One only has to look at the current situation to see that making the labour market more precarious, eroding workers’ rights and moderating wages are not going to increase productivity, combat poverty or respond to demand that is falling, both internally and externally.</p>
<p class="contents">The link between the economies of the Member States and the reduction in purchasing power is well known, as is the need to invest in education and training and in research and technology in order to facilitate higher productivity. As has already been stated here on several occasions, however, we need to do the opposite of what the stupid rules of the Stability Pact call for, which is forcing a reduction in public investment, leading to the State having no responsibility in the fields of health and education and making it difficult to use the Structural Funds correctly in the countries with the weakest economies. Similarly, economic and social cohesion requires a bigger Community budget, not the smallest budget to be proposed in recent years, which is what the Commission has just presented for 2004, accounting for less than 1% of Community gross national income. Similarly, liberalisations and privatisations are calling into question public service and its quality, as demonstrated by recent workers’ protests throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The most shocking aspect of this report, therefore, which closely follows the Commission’s recommendations for this year’s economic guidelines, is the argument it makes for its increasingly neoliberal measures despite the serious consequences they are having. The Commission makes its aim clear, by expressing the view that wage increases must remain moderate, with the aim of allowing profit margins to be re-established. The focus of the Commission’s policies is always profit and not people and this is why it is so insistent in calling for a flexible, mobile and cheap labour force, without rights, which can be used whenever, wherever and however employers wish, thereby supporting job instability over employment, and demonstrating total disregard for working people. I reiterate: this cannot be the way forward. The European Union must be a project for people and not only to increase the profit of a few and the workers should be given greater respect. Treating workers with dignity is a crucial step in increasing labour productivity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are debating these broad economic policy guidelines when, barely 48 hours ago, the French state was paralysed by a general strike and when huge demonstrations against government projects to reform the retirement pensions system brought together more than two million men and women from every town in France.</p>
<p class="contents">Has Mr Raffarin misinterpreted these broad guidelines that, overall, echo those of previous years? No, Mr Raffarin is a faithful disciple of the Commission. He forces himself to administer one of the potions, namely the sixteenth, recommended by the good doctors of Brussels. ‘In particular, Member States should over the coming three years design, introduce and effectively implement reforms of pension systems, encourage longer working lives by modifying incentives that encourage early withdrawal from the labour market and by restricting access to early retirement schemes, increase funding and improve, where necessary, access to supplementary pension schemes’.</p>
<p class="contents">Potion number 3 is also in danger of failing to promote social cohesion, which is however one of the objectives adopted in Lisbon. It concerns salaries. The Member States must ‘ensure that nominal wage increases are consistent with price stability and productivity gains. In particular, wage developments should remain moderate.’</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same lines, the measures providing for greater ‘flexibility’ in the labour market might be cited. Potion number 6: review labour market regulations. Potion number 7: facilitate labour mobility, both geographical and occupational.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Margallo report introduces a few touches of humanity into these economic remedies reminiscent of Molière’s Doctor Diafoirus, but he does not fundamentally alter the ultra-liberal philosophy underlying them. They are about erasing the social advances that, more often than not, are the result of workers’ struggles. Under the guise of promoting competition and increasing productivity, the process is under way of creating a society in which everyone is engaged in open warfare against everyone else. We are a long way from the model of the social market economy that might represent a European ideal, humanely reconciling the necessity for private initiative with the need for a social guarantee that each and every person’s basic needs will be met. It is symptomatic that these prescriptions demand sacrifices from employees alone. There is no mention of those possessors of capital who have accumulated, and are accumulating, considerable profits, in particular by practising unfair dismissal and by dissolving companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to quote an extract from an editorial in the Basque newspaper, <span class="italic">Egunkaria</span>, which was arbitrarily banned a few weeks ago. I quote, in translation: ‘Today, we are no longer in the age of Aristotle, who justified slavery by observing that ships did not sail unaided. Nowadays, when ships do in fact sail more or less unaided, economic policies should not seek growth at any price. They should seek quality, not quantity.’ That is not, unfortunately, the perspective from which these guidelines have been written, and that is why I shall not be able to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the eurozone – especially in France and Germany – these recommendations are, unfortunately, scarcely put into practice. Economic revival is having to wait, unemployment is increasing and the date of a return to balanced public finances is forever receding. Nowhere are anything but rigidity and tensions to be seen. I would also emphasise, incidentally, that the situation in the eurozone is much more serious than that in the rest of Europe. Responsibility for this failure is shared. At national level, never enough emphasis can be placed upon the disastrous consequences of the socialist periods in France, which set rational public discourse back years by inculcating the belief that increased spending could be accompanied by less effort, with people on a 35 hour working week and retiring at the age of 60, having contributed to their pensions for only a limited period. We have ended up with the unrealistic mentality that can be observed today and from which it will only be possible to emerge by educating people over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is also partly responsible for this situation, however, although this is not of course mentioned in the Commission’s document. The blame lies partly with the ideology of out-and-out openness, which ought to have stimulated reforms and which, in reality, destabilises societies and increases tension; with the pro-immigration policy, which was to have reinvigorated society but which, in reality, increases the burdens upon it and leads to social disintegration; and with the euro itself, which has done away with internal currency fluctuations but has at the same time introduced new and different forms of rigidity that impair growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not here talking solely about the rigidities of the Stability and Growth Pact, which will probably need to be deferred or made more flexible, but of forms of rigidity that are very much more serious because they are structural and that stem from the unification of monetary and exchange policies. Recommending the broad economic policy guidelines, as does the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil of this Assembly, is no way to solve these problems, because it does not give rise to any soul-searching or to any criticism of the European policies followed to date. The only perspective outlined is that of continuing down the road to unification and of doing so more radically, with more powers of coercion for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Only under duress could we recommend this path of unification, for it will prove disappointing, unproductive and, no doubt, even dangerous for Europe. In our opinion, the EU should change strategy and make the protection of European societies its number one priority. If people felt better defended, they would no doubt be a little more ready to adapt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I reject any coordination of Member States' economic policies by the European Union. The Member States must continue to be responsible for coordination. The method whereby, in all areas where the European Union has no competence, conditions are stipulated in the framework of open coordination and guidelines, is fundamentally wrong and moves Europe in the wrong direction. The responsibility for economic policy in Europe must remain with the individual Member States. What we need in Europe is competition between locations, which can be stimulated by the Member States' different economic policies and which in turn strengthens Europe as a location for business and investment and fosters positive development in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, economic policy coordination can take place, at best, where the bases for competition are strengthened and also, of course, wherever this common coordination aims to guarantee currency stability. It follows from this – if we emphasise the Member States' responsibility in this area – that the Member States also have a specific responsibility for taking the action now required. To put it another way, the economic problems which we currently face in Europe's economy are largely the economic problems of large Member States, namely France, Italy and Germany. What we must do is clearly underline that these are not cyclical problems but structural problems. The key question for these countries is this: will they manage to summon the strength to undertake reforms? These future reforms cannot simply mean tinkering with the system. No, the key question is this: will they summon the strength to overhaul the systems <span class="italic">per se</span> in these countries? When I say ‘overhaul the systems’, I mean the areas which exacerbate the structural problems. I mean the high labour costs, the high taxes, the costly healthcare systems, the inflexible labour markets, the obstructive trade unions, and the soaring costs of pensions. These are the areas where there are structural problems, and these are the areas which must be tackled. I believe that by undertaking structural reforms in the major areas of social spending as well as in the pensions sector, we will also remove the budget risks which in turn have an impact on the debt situation in the various countries. This is a crucial point, also in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact.

It is a balanced report which, more so than the guidelines themselves, is seeking to strike a balance between financial-economic and social and employment-directed policy. Like others, I think it is unfortunate that we were unable to discuss Mr Schmid's report on the employment guidelines today, for it is precisely this integrated approach that is of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Something which I would particularly like to address is the report's plea to set up a structural reforms action plan. Like others, including the Commissioner, I am critical about setting up yet another plan. I do think that the underlying analysis is right, namely that so little comes of the recommendations from previous global guidelines and of the Lisbon agenda because the Member States do not actually implement those recommendations and because the Commission does not have any actual power of enforcement in these matters. I share this view. Very often, many fine words are spoken and nothing is done about them. Furthermore, the same government leaders who agree on this are, in Brussels, often those who are reluctant to actually implement the attendant legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would welcome is for the plan for a task force, which was set up during the previous European Summit and which mainly aims to implement policy, to be coupled to this idea of structural reforms. I think that this idea fits in very well with what must be done by this task force under the leadership of Wim Kok, namely to draw the attention of the Member States to the need for implementing the strategy. In my view, the economic rigidities which Mr Margallo mentioned are precisely those things that fall within this scope of financial-economic and social and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a few points. Flexible employment patterns with certainties for workers; increase in labour productivity with a better quality of work; less rigid working and opening times, but also workers’ having more say about their hours; intensification of the knowledge potential, but lifelong learning for all, and all age categories; greater labour mobility, but with continuity of accrued rights; and the list goes on. In all those structural reforms, it is important to strike this balance and to create a basis for improvements rather than to call for protest.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the urgency is clear, that the direction is also clear if viewed in this context and that it is essential that those paper recommendations should be translated into real policy. Moreover, I hope that this task force can play an important part in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence, the regret and even anger I immediately feel at seeing Parliament consulted too late, and therefore too briefly, about an issue that is, however, vital to our fellow Europeans. We are indeed concerned with the period 2003-2005 which, as may be seen, has already largely begun.</p>
<p class="contents">My second regret, which also amounts to clear, firm disagreement, relates to the liberal philosophy underlying the report. The European Commission’s proposal and the report, are again based upon a justification of the Stability and Growth Pact, a fact which goes on to lay the foundations for almost all the proposals put before us. As many of my fellow MEPs have said, this is a step that is, at one and the same time, outmoded and retrograde. When growth is seen to have declined considerably and sharp increases in employment are again seen everywhere, there is nothing for it but to be in favour of revising the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">If growth is to be stimulated and jobs created, we must, as Europeans, give ourselves room for manoeuvre in our public finances in order to increase public and private investment, to stimulate research and development and to take account of the social dimension as a positive factor, rather than the restraining one that the liberals maintain it is. In the guidelines proposed to us, there is therefore, at one and the same time, an evident lack of political ambition and a dramatic inversion of political priorities, whereby employment becomes what I shall call a variable used to make adjustments to finances, the economy and the stock exchange and which leads to a proliferation of company restructurings whose only purpose is to increase financial profits.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, this morning, I would state my overall disagreement with the spirit, the principles and the poverty of the proposals being put before us. We shall therefore, of course, vote in favour of the amendments aimed at improving them, but we shall continue to fight for a Europe in which citizenship and the social dimension count for more.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I still have a few seconds left, I should like to conclude with a final word in the form of a question to those of our fellow MEPs who, this morning, have had some very harsh words to say about employees who defend their pensions, and I would ask them if they themselves are prepared to sacrifice their parliamentary pensions. In the light of my experience, allow me to say, Madam President, that I think they are probably not so prepared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is a genuinely disastrous situation, but the question is: what is it due to? I agree with the rapporteur that a new approach to economic policy is required, but what new approach? Neither the Commission nor the rapporteur seems to have a proper answer to that question. Might it have to do with the fact that the very starting point for the analysis has no basis in reality? The report says that economic development is poor in the EU. On average, that is of course no doubt the case, but the fact remains that, beneath that average, the reality varies incredibly from one EU country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the situation in Germany is incredibly serious. At the same time, it is by no means as bad in the three EU countries that have chosen to remain outside the eurozone: Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. In these countries, inflation and unemployment are lower than in the eurozone, and growth is higher. In 2002, growth in the eurozone was 0.9% compared with 1.8% in the three EU countries not participating in economic and monetary union. In Scandinavia, growth is highest in Denmark, the only country which, in a special referendum, said no to EMU. The German financial newspaper, <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span>, also stated the other day that one of the main causes of the German crisis is the exorbitant rate for the euro that makes German exports more expensive. In Sweden, we do not have this type of problem because, fortunately, we still have our own currency, the rate for which varies in relation to other currencies and is thus continually adjusted to the actual situation in the Swedish economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem for Germany is that, in a depression, it cannot, independently and on the basis of its own needs, decide how large a budget deficit it is to permit for the time being in accordance with normal principles of economic policy. When, as now, it is permitting an increased budget deficit to avoid a total economic disaster, the EU instead threatens to impose a fine upon the country.</p>
<p class="contents">All this shows that the attempt, via EMU and the euro, to conduct a centrally managed economic policy in 15 different countries has been a failure. The report does not, however, touch upon this. There is the feeling that EMU and the euro have become holy cows that cannot be criticised at all within the EU. When all the facts conspire to indicate that the EU countries should be permitted a greater measure of democratic self-determination, the rapporteur nonetheless chooses to emphasise dogmatically that the Member States are responsible for coordinating economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that a centrally directed bureaucratic economic policy within the EU is a disaster. There are many tasks to which the EU can profitably devote itself, for example those of contributing to peaceful conflict resolution and counteracting cross-border threats to the environment. The experiment involving a compulsory, uniform and standardised economic policy for all the EU countries has proved a failure. This is something I hope the Swedish electorate will remember when, on 14 September, it votes on whether or not Sweden is to exchange the krona for the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that this is actually not the case. In reality, things are not looking good for us. In recent decades, we have lived beyond our means. The fact is that our social, pensions and healthcare systems are no longer affordable. The result is that those who are willing and able to contribute find themselves burdened with levies and taxes which they can no longer afford. If we want to solve the problems, we must ease the burden on our contributors, which also means cutting taxes. Europe must distribute the burdens more fairly. As well as cutting taxes, we must also create employment conditions which once again enable businesses to create jobs so that working becomes a worthwhile option again. Work must become a worthwhile option in Europe once more. This is the only way to ensure that we can tackle our economic problems effectively in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, we have heard a great many noble objectives being expressed in today's debate. We have heard about full employment and social security, and there is undoubtedly a broad consensus here in this House. The only question is: how do we achieve it?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is responsible for competition, the internal market, the euro, for areas where there are common objectives and a common need for action, and I think that is the right approach. However, I am a fervent opponent of the plan to coordinate economic policies at European level in future. In fact, I would be happy if the things that do fall within European competence actually worked out in practice, which brings me to two points.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are today, with yet another debate about the Lisbon strategy; my astonishment mounts from day to day whenever the Commission talks about this strategy and claims that it is continuing to pursue this objective. Perhaps in many years' time, we will talk about how Europe had a dream. We should look at ourselves self-critically for once and ask how on earth we are ever to achieve this goal. I would like to focus on two points here, and I am particularly interested in tangible action. Firstly, I expect the Commission, in future, to identify exactly where the homework needs to be done at national level. In other words, it must put its finger on the weak spots, and do so promptly. This issue has already been addressed on numerous occasions. The second point that I see as being very important is that the Commission should not undermine its own actions in future. We have Commissioner Monti who is responsible for competition, we have Commissioner Bolkestein who deals with the internal market, we have Commissioner Liikanen who is responsible for business and who says what form it must take in Europe, we have Commissioner de Palacio, and we have Commissioner Solbes, who regularly tells us which structural reforms are needed in Europe and the Member States, and I support that, I am not criticising. However, where I do criticise these Commissioners and what annoys me is when the Commission itself produces proposals which conflict with this Lisbon objective, which conflict with the aim of deregulating the labour market. I am thinking, for example, of the directive on precontractual employment relationships and the form that they will have to take in future and also the discrimination which will occur if an entrepreneur – even if he has not yet signed a contract – fails to keep his eye on the ball and ends up being sued because the Commission did not think to build in a reversal of the burden of proof here. I have written to these Commissioners. Mr Solbes, you have answered on behalf of the Commission. Unfortunately, your answer was not specific enough. What I want from the Commission is a shift away from the principle that each Commissioner conducts the affairs of his or her department independently along the lines of ‘I'll do my thing and you do yours’. Please stop the Commission from producing any more directives like this, which, in practice, conflict with the objectives that you yourselves have set for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second point, namely the Stability and Growth Pact. On the one hand, I would like to thank you, for at a time when criticism of this issue is being voiced in the Commission, you have kept the flag flying and ultimately campaigned resolutely for the Stability and Growth Pact. However, here too, I expect you to put your finger on the weak spots clearly and promptly in future. The last time you appeared before us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinions you expressed on Germany were quite opaque. I asked you this: ‘Are you assuming that what is planned is adequate? Are you assuming that the deficit criterion will not be exceeded this year? Are you assuming that the target will be achieved in 2004 or 2006?’ We all knew that this would not be the case. Here, your task would be to speak up promptly and send out a clear warning signal so that no one is surprised when the target is not achieved after all. False expectations are being awakened, and you have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore to be hoped that these initiatives and the employment instruments and options that support them are coordinated, because they are intended to ensure economic recovery and growth, full employment and an improvement in the quality of work, social cohesion and inclusion and to increase the competitiveness of the Member States’ economies and of the economy of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore support the rapporteur’s ambition – which stands in contrast with the timidity of the Commission proposal – when he calls for the broad guidelines to make good use of the structural reforms and when he states that the Commission and the Member States must commit themselves to fulfilling a strictly timetabled action plan by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint discussion is taking place, coincidentally, a few days after the Ecofin Council was informed that France and Germany would not be able formally to meet the deficit criteria. It is significant that, having received new information, the Commission has confined itself to noting the fact, without feeling the need, where powerful economies such as those of France and Germany are concerned, to make harsher recommendations. If this is a sign that the time has come for the European institutions to look more closely at the real state of the Union’s economic development than at the uncritical and, sometimes, irrational compliance with criteria of debatable scientific value, all well and good. Discipline and financial rigour are obviously crucial, but it is utterly ridiculous to refuse to use the deficit – created by sound investment and accompanied by cutbacks in lower quality expenditure – as an instrument of anti-cyclical policy. Europe’s economic stagnation is serious, far-reaching and sustained and overcoming this will require a policy of active stabilisation that is not incompatible with long-term fiscal equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s observations on the Stability and Growth Pact are, therefore, pertinent. Public deficits must be evaluated flexibly, taking account of each State’s level of overall debt, public investment needs and requirements arising from the ageing of the population. The creation of a budgetary reserve, which is topped up in periods of growth and used in times of recession, will be a good measure, not least because some of today’s problems are rooted in the excessive tolerance the Commission has shown towards spending by some States at times when the economy is working well.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it would have been useful if the report had made a recommendation for the evaluation of excessive deficits to include a toned-down golden rule. It would then be the Commission’s task to identify the investments and public expenditure necessary to comply with the Lisbon strategy, in order to give coherence and harmony to all policies, instruments and objectives arising from the recent initiatives in the field of economic policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reference point for the essence of the economic guidelines was set by Ecofin itself, when it decided that the main objectives for the next three years would be to reform the pension systems in order to cope with the challenge of the ageing population, increase the efficiency and flexibility of the job market and improve competitiveness through education and training, research and technology. Whereas the socio-economic situation is worsening and inequalities are multiplying, the policy of structural reform, which results in unemployment being shared out, makes uncertainty and insecurity the norm and limits workers' incomes, is again being promoted in order to safeguard the lasting growth of the profits of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad economic policy guidelines are guidelines to promote the notorious Lisbon strategy, especially in the fields of employment relations and the social security systems. For the first axis of the economic guidelines, boosting economic growth, there is a call for the faithful application of the Stability Pact, a reduction in wage and non-wage costs, a link between wages and productivity, measures to make part-time and temporary work the norm and the promotion of disincentives which will prevent workers from leaving productive activity, the aim being the mandatory extension of working life, and measures for training in early retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second axis, reducing public debt, there is a call for a drastic cut in social spending on workers' health and health care, the aim being for government pension, health and welfare systems, spending on health care, programmes to support the unemployed etc., in other words all forms of social spending, to be cut back because they undermine financial stability, given that government budgets are not in a position to meet these costs.</p>
<p class="contents">For the third, the reform of the pension systems and health care systems, and in the name of financial equilibrium, there is a call for the speedier overturn of the pension systems by increasing the retirement age and reducing pensions, in other words, the gradual abolition of the state's social security obligations and the encouragement of privatisation and commercialisation of the health and welfare sectors. In other words, the aim is to impose the liberal choices of big business by fire and sword. It is, to say the least, unacceptable, under pressure from monopoly interests, to persist with such unsuccessful measures, which lead the workers into impoverishment and marginalisation, in order to support the unaccountable profiteering of big business. The workers are reacting intensely to this policy and are taking to the streets <span class="italic">en masse </span>in all the countries which are trying to apply it.</p>
<p class="contents">We support them in their struggle and join with them in condemning this anti-grass roots policy for serving the interests of capital and we are contributing to their fight and supporting the formation of anti-monopolistic, anti-imperialistic rallies to overturn it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, time does not allow me to deal in detail with all the points raised. I will however make a few remarks I think are relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am grateful to the House for its cooperation. I appreciate the problems it is up against. I too would have welcomed a joint debate on the broad economic guidelines and the employment guidelines today. Sadly, one was not possible. I appreciate how little time Parliament has available. The Council and the Commission are under similar constraints. It should be borne in mind that the Commission’s proposals need to be based on decisions taken at the Spring European Council. It is therefore very difficult to start on this kind of work before April.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, today’s debate is essentially about whether the economic policy decided on is right for the current situation, or whether this situation should lead us to change our economic policy. It appears that two issues have become confused in the course of the debate, namely economic policy and the instruments of economic policy. In my view, a study of the operation of macroeconomic policy during this period suggests it is helping to handle the crisis. Monetary policy has changed, obviously. Also, fiscal policy is now markedly more expansive than before as a function of the limits agreed under the Stability and Growth Pact. I shall return to this point later.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, however, that the current situation should not lead us to back pedal regarding structural reform. After all, structural reform is about modernising our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested that the Stability and Growth Pact is acting as a brake on the economy at present, and that it is a problem. I would argue that the Stability Pact has been presented in too simplistic a way, as a rigid tool that does not allow any room for manoeuvre. This is not the case. A further mistaken assumption was made, namely that discretionary fiscal policies are right for any economic situation. I think economic theory says otherwise and holds that such policies are only appropriate in very specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is worth thinking carefully about what I consider a crucial issue. It appears that the very countries experiencing the greatest difficulties are precisely those that currently have the greatest deficit. One might wonder whether the deficit caused the poor economic situation or whether it was the other way around. I feel we need to look elsewhere in search of a solution. Recent developments in Japan and the internal impact of measures taken by the present Administration in the United States are worth considering.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain convinced that the Stability and Growth Pact is the best instrument at our disposal. It provides for an appropriate and flexible fiscal policy. This policy is created automatically, insofar as the automatic stabilisers are allowed to operate. Impulsive action is controlled and the potentially negative consequences prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the vision of our economic policy presented has, in some cases, tended to be anecdotal. It focused on detail and veered towards caricature. This is most certainly not a policy based more or less exclusively on wage restrictions. Nothing could be further from reality. Wages are always set in relation to productivity. This is not a policy focusing solely on employment either.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy consists of three key instruments I referred to earlier. These are sound macroeconomic policies, structural reforms together and medium and long term economic, social and environmental sustainability. We do not have flexibility in the labour market exclusively in mind, not even when referring to structural employment policies. What we are about is the development of the population, the rate of employment and, of course, labour markets adjusted to the new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the economic policy guidelines do not run counter to what was agreed at Lisbon. Rather, they are one of the many instruments allowing us to implement the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised at the emphasis on drawing up new action plans and new lists of things to be done. I am also surprised at the many references to the need to be better informed about what is happening. I assume the House is aware that the Commission’s summary report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy was published in January. This report contains all the necessary information on the progress made by each of the Member States in implementing Lisbon. You will even find lists and tables showing which countries performed best and which did worst. In addition, you will find details of which three countries performed best or worst on each of the objectives. All the information is therefore available. Furthermore, a report on implementation of the broad economic guidelines is drawn up annually and indicates clearly where the shortcomings are.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main problem does not therefore involve understanding the situation we are in, but in trying to change it. By virtue of our system, this falls within the competence of the Member States. Our present system is based on peer pressure, as I stated earlier. This is obviously a crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of honourable Members mentioned the open method of coordination. In my view, this should only be applied in cases where the Treaty does not provide for a specific method. It is therefore a useful method, but one to be used sparingly and by agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry time does not permit me to go into further detail. I would however like to take this opportunity of thanking you all for your contributions to this morning’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
