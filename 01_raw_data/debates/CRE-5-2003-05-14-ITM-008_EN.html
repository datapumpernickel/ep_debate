<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity given to me today to refer to the relations between the European Union and Russia is exceptionally timely, given that the summit in St Petersburg, which will be held at the end of May, has given occasion both here and in Moscow for an integrated examination of the framework for cooperation between the two sides. Preparations for this summit were also an occasion for a more global approach to the question of cooperation with Russia and essentially demonstrate the common wish to strengthen our relations on the basis of common objectives, on the basis of a mutual effort to resolve problems and create new prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic parameter of our plan is the realisation that Russia is a strategic partner for the Union, its biggest and most important neighbour. At the same time, enlargement will increase the points of contact, the common interests and the common challenges even more. Despite the difficulties which it is encountering in its efforts to change to a market economy, Russia is still a country with huge potential. The current international climate has also reminded us once again of the importance of our strategic relations with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this image does not make us also forget its major weaknesses. As I just said, the Russian economy is still in a transitional stage. Its economy accounts for just one tenth of the volume of this economy, that is, of the Union of the 15; it absorbs just 4% of our exports, while the European Union absorbs 40% of its exports. Similarly the institutions of the market economy remain weak and the financial sector in particular is facing problems and its regulatory framework needs to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Russia has still not joined the World Trade Organisation. Its political system presents a similar picture. Despite significant progress in the field of stabilising democracy, there are still shortcomings in relation to human rights, especially in Chechnya, which I shall come back to, as well as problems of organised crime and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is without doubt in the Union's interest to help Russia develop a stable, democratic, prosperous society by strengthening its ties to Europe. This is something we have achieved in other cases, using different types of tools, of course, than those which have to do with Russia. And although the means we use are different, essentially the objectives, in other words the dissemination of the Union's values to its surroundings, to its environment, both geographical and political, always constitute the basis of our policy. With this thought in mind, we took initiatives, as soon as we assumed the Presidency, for an initial evaluation of the adequacy of our framework for cooperation with Russia. As we know, relations with Russia are based, from the contractual point of view, on a partnership and cooperation agreement. This was signed in 1994 under the previous Greek Presidency. May I remind you that this is the type of agreement which the European Union has kept for all the countries of the former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic States, which we recently welcomed as members of the ΕU. Consequently, apart from a few differences, the same type of agreement ties us to Russia as ties us to the countries of central Asia. This lack of proportion quickly became apparent, given that the partnership and cooperation agreement was unable to cover sufficient sectors, such as close cooperation on judicial matters and internal affairs, on foreign policy and defence matters, on the questions of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, combating terrorism and other matters. That was one of the main reasons why we adopted a common strategy with Russia in 1999. This cooperation was implemented in a series of ad hoc initiatives. I can mention by way of example the energy dialogue, the initiative to create a common European Economic Area, the action plan for cooperation on questions of justice and internal affairs, which do not, however, have a contractual legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Appraisals of the adequacy of the EU-Russia cooperation framework, as regards covering a broad range of relations, vary. Everyone acknowledges that the framework has, to a great extent, been overtaken by events and that this will become even more apparent in the future. On the other hand, neither the ΕU nor Russia appear to be ready to proceed with a radical reform of the framework, a reform that would also presuppose time-consuming procedures for new negotiation and ratification. In the face of this situation, the Presidency proposed that the work of the summit should focus exclusively on the future of our relations with Russia, approaching the matter at two levels, naturally with the St Petersburg summit, as the datum plane for taking decisions. The first level is to reform the cooperation structures with the objective of rationalisation and of securing tangible results on a regular basis and the second level is to examine the possibility of the summit's giving the political order to start up the procedure for processing ideas and strengthening the cooperation framework in the sectors in which this is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first level for reforming cooperation structures, the procedure has already borne fruit with specific proposals to the Russian side. We hope that Russia will respond positively and that this will be reflected in the summit's decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the second level is concerned, there are some reservations between the partners about the extent to which it is advisable for us to start up the procedure for reforming our relations with Russia, at a time when the existing framework has not yet been fully applied. We believe that, in order for us to engage Russia in a procedure of gradual harmonisation with European standards, a balanced policy of incentives and preconditions is needed, which can also include in the incentives the prospect of the long-term upgrading of the cooperation framework in sectors in which we all know this is needed and in which everything shows that this will happen sooner or later, especially on second and third pillar issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the St Petersburg summit, the first following enlargement and with the participation of all the new Member States, is the appropriate forum for taking this step.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the medium- and long-term prospects of our relations with Russia, we have also focused on achieving tangible results on a series of outstanding issues. A major issue that has dragged on in relations between the two sides, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment and Programme for Russia, has already been set for the 21 May in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the problems with the application of the solution for the movement of people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia have been overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, negotiations have started on the conclusion of an EU-Russia readmission agreement and we hope they will be completed quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we are optimistic that the mechanism for resolving differences within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement will have been set up by the time the summit takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts to persuade Russia to invite the ten new members of the Union to St Petersburg are also having positive results. Thus the summit is acquiring even greater symbolic importance and may contribute to a peaceful and secure Europe which confronts challenges with closer cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also decided in our deliberations with Russia to link progress on matters of greater interest to Russia with corresponding progress on matters of greater interest to us, the ΕU, so that we arrive at specific results. Thus, we have focused our efforts on the environment, by which I mean Russia has to agree to ratify the Kyoto protocol, on nuclear safety, on issues of safety at sea and on issues of justice and home affairs, with the emphasis on progress with negotiations on the readmission agreement. Finally, I would point out the common interest in combating the threat of narcotics from Afghanistan and central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words about Chechnya, to which we attach particular importance. First of all, I should like once again to express our disgust about the recent criminal terrorist bombings which cost the lives of dozens of people. There has been another such attack today. On the other hand, I want to welcome the statements by President Putin following the attack, in which he promised to continue efforts to resolve the problem by political means. We believe that political procedure and dialogue are the only way to achieve a lasting solution to the problem. We continue to take every opportunity to underline the need for respect for human rights and the need to punish those involved in violations of human rights and in violations of international humanitarian law. At the same time, we need to encourage Moscow to move towards the application of an integrated policy on Chechnya, the aim of which will be the establishment of peace, the consolidation of a climate of trust and the economic and social reconstruction of the area. In order to achieve this, we must examine the possibility of drawing up specific programmes that will aim to promote democracy, the rule of law, institutions and social recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the results of the March referendum are concerned, we note with satisfaction that, despite the particularly difficult situation, the ballot was held without any violent episodes being reported. We must point out that, despite any irregularities and organisational weaknesses there may have been, the vote in favour of the constitution would appear at first glance to be positive and may be seen as a first step by Moscow towards a political settlement in Chechnya. Finally, the presidency considers that the OSCE can provide valuable help to efforts by the Russian authorities in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">We heartily support the efforts by Holland which, in its capacity as chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, is holding discussions with the Russian Government in connection with the <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of a new OSCE mission in Chechnya. We welcome the results of the discussions so far, which appear to be paving the way for the presence of Holland there and we hope that the Organization will thus be able to start operating and make a positive contribution to efforts for peace and democracy in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both sides are in full agreement that we have wide-ranging relations on a long-term basis, and that these relations need to be based on common values and should be further developed in the direction of a strategic partnership. For our part, we attach particular importance to cooperation in what we regard as areas of risk that we can only overcome together, such as environmental protection, nuclear safety and justice and home affairs issues. Our relations with Russia will also, but not to the exclusion of all else, be shaped by the enlargement of the European Union, as the debate that we have just had shows. The neighbourhood policy that we discussed here this afternoon plays an important role in our relations with Russia, but there are also other significant factors, such as the security of the European Union's energy supply, the joint war on terror, and the need for cooperation to solve major regional and global problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On Russia's side, there is particular interest in cooperation on security policy, as evidenced by Russian participation in the police mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina or the proposal for a joint European centre for crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently made very good progress in some areas, particularly on Kaliningrad. I am pleased to say that the transit issues that the European Parliament dealt with in considerable detail have now been resolved. The instruments that we proposed in conjunction with Russia at the time have now been introduced and can be implemented as from July. A special Tacis programme for Kaliningrad has also been agreed so as to help ensure that instead of the socio-economic gap between Kaliningrad and neighbouring countries widening – which has already been mentioned this afternoon – it will be narrowed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, good progress has been made in negotiations on a readmission agreement. I would also like to mention that the energy dialogue with Russia has led to concrete results. Examples of this are agreement on projects of common interest and the energy technology centre in Moscow. We hope that we will be able to present a joint plan for the common economic area by the end of this year. Good progress is being made in the negotiations on Russia's membership of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week we will be signing the multilateral nuclear environmental programme with Russia and other donor countries in Stockholm. This certainly represents a breakthrough in dealing with contaminated nuclear sites in north-west Russia. We are hoping for a ban on single-hull vessels transporting heavy fuel oils in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been achieved in Russia. This subject will therefore have to be given high priority in the forthcoming talks at political level.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not ignore the fact that there are many areas where, although we agree on the fundamental objectives, we nevertheless have different ideas about how to achieve those objectives. Neither side wants to see new ‘moats’ or ‘curtains’ in Europe. In particular, the Commission hopes that the neighbourhood policy proposals it brought forward in March will prevent new ‘moats’ developing on the European Union's eastern borders, which could lead to a two-class Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlarged Union will have to further intensify and deepen cooperation with its neighbours, but our security needs dictate that the new Member States should also fully and effectively implement the Schengen rules when they join Schengen. There are considerable reservations within the European Union about the Russians' desire for a detailed timetable for complete visa freedom. It is of course conceivable as a long-term objective, and it is something the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement committees could deal with. Nevertheless, we should as of now be taking advantage of the full scope of the Schengen framework to make minor border traffic as simple as possible and to promote cross-border economic development. This will of course also require the refinement of technical assistance instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful that the President-in-Office commented on Chechnya. I simply wish to confirm that on behalf of the Commission. Chechnya is also still very much on our agenda and our list of priorities remains the same: a peaceful political solution, respect for human rights and humanitarian aid. We concur with the Russians that our cooperation structures should be shaped more efficiently. Nevertheless, we cannot agree to their wish for extensive use of the 15+1 formula, or in future a 25+1 formula. This brings us very close indeed to the central issue of the EU's identity. We do, however, believe that there is considerable scope for improving the way the institutions work under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, especially as regards the Cooperation Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we would like to emphasise that we may have different views about the process of adapting to EU enlargement. Russia is currently working on the assumption that extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new EU Member States provides an opportunity to renegotiate trade policy and other issues. We do not see it that way. In contrast, we hope that the basically positive view of EU enlargement in Russia will help to maintain the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as the basis of our relations, including the new Member States.

<p class="contents">Russia of course remains an exceptionally important topic for us, not so much because our border has become so much longer, since the accession of Finland, which brought the larger part of that border with it. In fact, the border has been extended only around Kaliningrad and the Baltic states.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like therefore to begin with the latter. The last time this was discussed I asked whether the Council, following on from the treatment of the Kaliningrad question on transit visas for Russian citizens, could urge Russia to ensure that the border agreements between Russia and the three Baltic states are all ratified. This question is still hanging over the market somewhat. In the previous debate the Commissioner gave an unambiguous indication of complete agreement, since Russians going to St Petersburg will travel not via Lithuania and Belarus but via Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. That is why it is vitally important that this gives us a means of exerting pressure on the Russians to get rid of this silly little discrepancy. I hope that the President of the Council will give that point a moment’s thought.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Council also talked of the agreements and of course he also had in mind the complaints that have been made about their implementation. He promises us streamlining, meaning that there must also probably be a better focus on Russian complaints too, that greater efficiency, more guaranteed finance – naturally an important point in any case – more support with project management, etc. will be forthcoming and that a new northern-dimension <span class="italic">environmental programme </span>could probably serve as a model. I was gratified to hear that progress in being made in that respect, since on our last visit to Murmansk we found that the cleaning up of those nuclear submarines is proceeding at an extremely slow rate. It is in our mutual interest that this process should be accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it would be interesting if you could tell us to what extent TACIS can be associated with cross-border projects. Cross-border projects are always difficult in any case, but it seems that using TACIS actually makes things a little more difficult still.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to see that the common European economic area also came up for discussion at the summit. I should like to ask whether that is one of the typical effects of our idea of a <span class="italic">wider Europe</span>. Does this <span class="italic">wider Europe </span>in fact relate to these kinds of bilateral agreements, like this common economic area with Russia?</p>
<p class="contents">In that context have we considered other matters that might be raised in the framework of a <span class="italic">wider Europe</span>, for example the democratic development of Russia? Can we exert any influence? If so, in what way? The fact is that, as yet, the Russian Federation cannot be called an entirely normal democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Many say that Russia should be integrated into the security structures of Europe. I have a question on this point. It is naturally splendid that Russia should be integrated into trans-Atlantic security structures. That strikes me as an excellent first step. But what would be the effect if Russia, which after all is a former superpower with a great military capability, were to start playing a major role in European security and defence policy? It seems to me that our relationship would become slightly unbalanced. I should especially like to hear the Council’s assessment of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also calls on the Commission to set up a strategic partnership. That means of course that there must be convergence in EU policy. Strategic partnership, by bringing the whole EU into line, actually has more meaning for us than it does for Russia. That has been apparent in the past. Now, with the crisis in Iraq and the crisis in the EU regarding Iraq, what are the actual prospects of the convergence of this policy in a strategic partnership with Russia? I should like to wish the Commissioner much courage in publishing reports on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now a historic time – in Russia, in the Union, and in the world too – and we must act. We have only partly implemented this master document, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Bureaucracy has obstructed reform, and inertia, the Kaliningrad question, environmental problems and the mass media have generally drained it of its strength. Terrorist attacks, whose victims’ relatives I want to express my deep condolences to – and my sympathies also go to the victims themselves – show that there is opposition to any political solution in Chechnya, although my understanding is that the Russian Government has gone down that path by actually organising elections. The human rights situation in Russia still needs a lot of work. It may be that if we are to deal with the Chechnya issue, which is souring relations between us, we need to provide a working group to plod on with the task in cooperation with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforms in Russia have thus been slow to come about. Meanwhile, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are gaining strength more rapidly and sustainably, being led in their progress by the European Union. Russia may lose its markets in the region, and Union enlargement, if the worst comes to the worst, may isolate Russia. For that reason I want to emphasise the need for a new approach: we need a new strategic partnership with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraq war has shown that Russia is part of a European area of cooperation. It is the most recent example of that. The spearhead of this partnership could be Russia’s modernisation and its civil society movement. Cooperation on energy, an area where still only a little has been achieved, could give a boost to its economy. An example of this might be the Northern Dimension, which, with the right financing, would strengthen this partnership. Russia must put the Investments Protection Agreement in order. The country must be made a member of the WTO as soon as possible, and given a certain role to play in European security cooperation. The fact is, the faster Russia ‘westernises’, the faster human rights will improve there.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is constructing no fewer than three oil ports in a remote part of the Gulf of Finland, which is known for its reefs and which forms one end of the Baltic Sea, the world’s most ecologically burdened sea. In winter the solid ice cover there is 70 centimetres thick and the pack ice is anything up to 20 metres high. This last winter dozens of ships were cast adrift by ice, there being no help available from an ice breaker – ships on their way to Russia. Vessels not strong enough to withstand the pressure of ice and in such an appalling condition as those are an environmental time bomb, just like the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>was. I want to ask the Council what action Greece, as the country to hold the Presidency, has taken to ensure that only double-hull, ice-strengthened tankers, which can get there safely, should travel to these three new oil ports in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing about Russia that has often gone unremarked. That is the importance of its culture, about which still too little is known in Europe. Now that the machinery we work with, the information society, is crying out for content, Russian content production could diversify and enrich content production in Europe, which is engaged in global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has turned westwards, but I think it has also turned to the north, which is apparent from Russian activity in the northern and northwestern regions. This means that a new opportunity has now been created for the European Union and Russia to swiftly improve their mutual cooperation, along with the chance for them both to benefit from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The position taken here is forward-looking and constructive, although it also has criticisms to make. The resolution will also be of use with regard to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting between the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to be held in Moscow next week.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own part I would like to stress that we must try to narrow the economic and social differences that exist on all the Union’s external borders. With the border between the EU and Russia becoming much longer than before, we must make dramatic improvements to cross-border cooperation. We must particularly encourage the Member States and their regions located on the EU’s external borders to create direct links over the border to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Such systematic programmes of cooperation between neighbouring regions have been in place on the border between Finland and Russia for a good ten years now. There now has to be the same kind of action both between Estonia and Russia and Latvia and Russia. Lithuania and Poland, meanwhile, must take special responsibility for the development of the Kaliningrad region. The Union has to be prepared to finance this cooperation between neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">For cooperation in the border regions we need a new system of funding. The current TACIS and Interreg systems are not strong enough and they cannot be adequately coordinated. We have to create a new system of funding that can be used on the Union’s other external borders too. The PHARE scheme, before it became part of the accession process, might serve as a model for this new system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reference has already been made to the issues connected with the Kaliningrad region, which I believe have still not yet been satisfactorily resolved, not to mention the failure of the Russian Government or the European Union to make purposeful, comprehensive or even strategic use of the opportunities that might result from this problem. ‘Strategic’ is, in my mind, the key word in terms of what I am talking about. I believe that we should be evaluating the European Union’s joint strategy from June 1999 – to which Mr Oostlander has already referred – in a much more critical light. To date, I believe, it has been neither joint nor – in the literal sense of the word – a strategy, nor is the far more modest framework for relations between the European Union and Russia that we actually have being adequately realised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in the first place, to highlight our responsibility and the chances we have of a strategic partnership in the area of security policy. I believe it to be of great significance that the European Union and Russia are, by means of the strategic development of their relations, contributing to multilateralism, helping to strengthen international law, to advance international cooperation, the UN, international agreements and disarmament. I can also see the present need for the UN to have a role in the reconstruction of Iraq. Secondly, there is a need for our economic relations with Russia to develop further in terms of substance and of quality. I regard the energy alliance as very important indeed, but as not going far enough. It should, I think, be quite consciously about the development of economic ties that would to some degree be mutual and on an equal footing. I believe that to make economic sense, and that it could make a very close relationship between the European Union and Russia irreversible. I believe it to be also utterly unacceptable that Russia’s exports to the EU are arranged similarly to what one would expect from a developing country that is rich in raw materials. I know it will be very difficult to change that. This makes political efforts by both sides particularly important. Thirdly, any strategic partnership demands that both parties be consistent in their commitment to democracy and the implementation of human and minority rights. One has to accept that this will be evaluated in different ways. What is not acceptable is that human rights and their role should be regarded purely in terms of economic cycles, as I believe they are by many EU governments, especially as regards the issue of Chechnya. I see that as also a sign that there is no strategy. Let me conclude by saying that I hope that we, the European public, and also those of us who sit in this House, will, in our dealings with the Commission, the Council, and the Russian Government, have the courage to speak rather more resolutely about the strategic and institutional objective of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia, so that the door may be kept open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While deals are being done about the shared use of Russia’s enormous energy sources and cooperation in the field of armaments is being negotiated, fundamental democratic rights and respect for human rights no longer have any part to play, even though full respect for human and minority rights are the basis for all forms of partnership, cooperation, and economic relationship – something that the first paragraph of the Agreement makes abundantly clear. What this means is that the restrictions on the freedom of the press, the hounding of journalists, the massive political pressure on the justice system, conditions in prisons and, not least, the human rights violations in the war on the Chechen people must have a central place in the summit talks and must not be allowed to appear only as the dessert course at the final banquet.</p>
<p class="contents">Concessions in economic relations and help with military research must be made conditional on significant improvements in the human rights situation in Russia, and on the country’s respect for fundamental rights. That, at any rate, was what was agreed here in this House between the Commission, the Council and Parliament when the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was approved. My expectation of the Commission and the Council is that they keep their promise, which will mean that the discussion must give priority to peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chechnya, and that there must be real insistence on dialogue at long last. It is clear that we all – my own group included – condemn the crimes that are being committed there by both sides, the bomb attacks as much as the crimes committed by the troops of the Russian Interior Ministry. We condemn the attempt to find solutions by means of violent acts against the civilian population. That is not acceptable. Peaceful dialogue is the only option, but it must be made possible by concessions on the part of the Russian Government and, most of all, by the crimes committed under the aegis of the State against the civilian population being punished.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to ask you to reverse the priorities at this summit and not give centre stage to economic relations in the way you have done today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely this political urgency that demands an effective approach. In that sense clear doubts are being raised about the Russian anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya. Not least by Russian politicians and Russian citizens themselves. On the main cause a recent academic analysis is clarity itself: ‘The main obstacle to a true normalisation and pacification of Chechnya is the atrocities committed by Russian forces and special units.’ Sadly, the Chechen terror gangs attract many young Chechens who are otherwise afraid that they will be picked up, abused, tortured and maybe even shot by Russian troops who are completely out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution before us says nothing about this worrying situation in the Northern Caucasus. This House wishes, in view of the penultimate paragraph, to await the report on the visit of its delegation to Chechnya in mid-June. Hopefully the Council and Commission will raise the question of tackling the thoroughly deplorable Chechen terrorism – let there be no misunderstanding on that point – at the forthcoming summit with the Russian Federation. And not only because of wider geographical repercussions…</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to another important point concerning regional security and stability. Paragraph 4 of the draft resolution welcomes the active participation of both the EU and Russia in the Middle East peace process. However, that process is not served in any way by the military and nuclear ambitions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The US is afraid that these Iranian ambitions are being given practical sustenance by the present nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran. At the beginning of this month therefore there was an American request to Russia to reconsider this specific cooperation. Do Council and Commission share these concerns of our Atlantic ally and do they also intend to raise this question at the forthcoming Summit with the Kremlin? I sincerely hope that they will make a common trans-Atlantic front against Russia and Iran! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (NI).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow on the relations between the European Union and Russia is frankly repugnant. Mr Oostlander talked to us about his concerns regarding democratisation, or the lack of democratisation, in Russia, but he did not say a word in his four-minute speech about Chechnya. Mr Paasilinna, who together with Mr Oostlander is one of the main initiators of this resolution, did not mention it either. The resolution even goes so far as to praise the Russian military forces for their peacekeeping efforts. Russian peacekeeping forces, in Chechnya or elsewhere – like a few years ago in Afghanistan – let everyone judge for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">For once, at least the Council spoke a little about Chechnya, but I feel that the Council is deluding itself and I would even go so far as to say that it is lying to itself. However, by the same token, it is lying to us and telling us stories because the issue is not that which the President-in-Office of the Council outlined. The political solution proposed by Mr Putin is not a political solution. It encourages two forms of terrorism: the terror imposed on a daily basis by the Russian forces in Chechnya and the actions of gangs of terrorists secretly assisted by these same Russian military forces, who now occupy the entire territory and no longer give the political solution advocated by the Council a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried everything, Europe did everything it could to isolate Mr Maskadov, who was nonetheless elected by the people of Chechnya during elections legitimised by the OSCE. The European Union has done everything it can to ensure that the ministers of Mr Maskadov’s Government cannot move throughout Europe and can no longer meet the political authorities in the various EU countries. It has done everything in its power to destroy any possibility of real negotiations between the Chechens and the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have a kind of Quisling controlling Grozny and the surrounding area, who obeys Moscow. From time to time, he rebels and draws up a report, which you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in which he speaks about the daily policy of terror implemented by the Russian authorities in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reality today. Without President Maskadov, peace will not be possible and no political solution will be possible in Chechnya. Without a clear message to President Putin to launch negotiations, there will be no solution in Chechnya. Moreover, Mr Putin stated about 10 months ago in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> that the problem facing Russia was not that of the final status of Chechnya but one of security. Mr Maskadov’s Foreign Minister has proposed provisional administration of Chechnya by the United Nations, precisely to reassure the Russian authorities and to establish, within five or ten years, a Chechnyan administration that would provide a guarantee against the threats to Russian security.</p>
<p class="contents">You do not talk about this; you do not want to see it happen; you do not want to see the Chechnyan Foreign Minister, who can no longer move throughout Europe and to whom you refuse a visa, just as you refuse visas to the other members of Mr Maskadov’s government. That is the opposite of what should be done and yet it is what you continue to do. That is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror, which, every day, as Mr Belder and Mrs Schroedter said, pushes young Chechens to despair, young people who have seen their parents, brothers and cousins killed in Grozny or in other towns in Chechnya, kidnapped and raped by the Russian forces. By acting this way, you are pushing them into the arms of the extremists who finance some of the madmen operating elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to change this attitude as soon as possible. If not, instead of champagne, you will be agreeing to drink blood at the next St Petersburg summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need Russia as a partner, and I believe deeper cooperation with it to be both desirable and worth striving after, for the Russians should understand the enlargement of the European Union not as a hostile act, but as an opportunity. As has been frequently said, borders shift and change, and one of the consequences of enlargement is that we will be sharing borders with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution, under the Danish Presidency, of the problem with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad – the former Königsberg – is very much to be welcomed. Now there is also to be a new summit on 31 May, an EU-Russia summit on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of St Petersburg. There has since 1999 been a common strategy, whose cornerstones are meant to be democracy, the rule of law, further integration into a European economic and social area and general enhancement of security and stability in Europe, along with reforms in the energy sector and the shared struggle against organised crime. Russia does not aspire to membership of the European Union, which would go against its conception of itself as a major power. The European Union should seek genuine cooperation with Russia, which would, not least, involve the European Investment Bank being allowed more opportunities for activity in Russia, an idea put forward by, among others, Mr Schüssel, the Austrian Chancellor, who propounded it in a letter to President Prodi of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If Russia were to ratify the agreement with the European Investment Bank, which agreement is oriented towards the Northern dimension, the Russians would at once have billions of euros at their disposal, which would make it possible for a fair amount of nuclear waste to be disposed of. As far as Chechnya is concerned, it is clear that we must demand that human rights be respected, just as much as we must condemn terrorism, which again claimed civilian victims only a few days ago. Diplomacy, however, is what is called for here, in order to break the spiral of violence and responses to violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On many previous occasions, we have pretended that we have achieved results. Today, we are, however, saying quite clearly that we are holding meetings but that the results are rather far from being achieved. I am pleased about this honesty, and I therefore hope that the Commission’s approach will in actual fact prevail. We do not need any new organisations. As for the advice that has been given – 15 plus 1 – I hope that the EU will reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also in actual fact believe that it is a little too optimistic to do as some of us in Parliament have done and talk in terms of our having the same basis of values. There is a risk of the EU not being so unanimous in its approach to Russia as this debate suggests. There are forces that may intervene in such a way as to cause division in the EU’s view. Moreover, we are silent on the issue of Chechnya. Think of the issue of new organisations and of freedom from visas. I really do hope that the policy adopted by the Commission will apply. If disagreement arises on issues of this type and if the Commission’s and the Council’s attitude does not then prevail, we shall have relations between the EU and Russia similar to those we have today between the EU and the United States, that is to say relations characterised by division.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that both the Commission and the Council addressed the environmental issues. We have had success with the MNEPR. It was really not, however, the PCA Agreement that led the way but, rather, money. In addition to those you mentioned, there are many other unsolved environmental issues. These are issues linked to the Stockholm and Espoo Conventions and marine safety. I would ask you to keep the pressure up when it comes to those issues that are important to us, such as marine safety. Issues of marine safety, the environment and human rights must be on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are, of course, interested in having, as with every other country, a successful summit. The precise objective of the meetings being held is to promote the objectives which we too have in accordance with the ambitions, values and principles that we want to promote. We know that these procedures are often time-consuming and laborious. I know of no procedure which quickly results in changes, in solutions to problems which have dragged on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to Kaliningrad. The solution for Kaliningrad is progressing to timetable and I think that it is progressing satisfactorily. The ratification by the duma of the border agreement with Lithuania will have taken place by 30 June, according to the commitments entered into. And we expect the same for the readmission agreement between Russia and Lithuania.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I should like to say that provision has been made for a special TACIS programme on Kaliningrad and our precise objective is for the summit to give the order to draw up a strategy jointly with Russia, so that there is integrated development of this Russian area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Northern Dimension is concerned, we are currently preparing the new action plan and the Commission is preparing a first draft which we shall subsequently process within the framework of the Council. We consider that the Northern Dimension must continue to be an important development tool in our relations with Russia. The signature of the MNΕPR agreement will release funds for protection against nuclear dangers in north-west Russia, funds which have been amassed precisely within the framework of the Northern Dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that huge changes have been made as regards Russia over the last thirteen years. Traditional stereotypes have been overturned, new premises have been created, Russia's relations with the European Union, with ΝΑΤΟ, with the United States, have changed radically and this is creating new situations, of which each Member State and the European Union as a whole are weighing the importance and deciding to see how to proceed and what momentum to give.</p>
<p class="contents">Within these frameworks, one needs to take account of the reports on foreign policy, security and defence issues, but I should like to point out that one needs to be very, very careful here. These are not issues that can proceed quickly. They need a long-term perspective and strategy and a method that does not create confrontations and contradictory situations on basic strategic choices by the European Union and Europe as a whole. We therefore welcome the possibilities opening up and are proceeding with the methods and the degrees of freedom that we judge are opening up on each occasion and allowing us closer forms of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
