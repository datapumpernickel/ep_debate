<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE). –</span></span>   Mr President, on behalf of all my colleagues I would like very much to welcome Mr Kinnock here to discuss the reforms. I would like to say to him that it is not through lack of effort on our part that it has taken a long time to get this question on the agenda. It has been very disappointing that we have not made progress with the Bureau to elevate the importance of this discussion. Nevertheless we will make up for it tonight and it is a pleasure to have you here.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the reforms – and I know you will be able to tell us much more about them in a moment – are at a critical stage. We know you have been consulting extensively. In a way that presents us with a dilemma in Parliament. You will know from the support for my report last year that colleagues have taken a very deep and intensive interest in the whole package of reforms and we have given you strong support for them. Indeed, we have been very conscious of the fact that these reforms need to be implemented as quickly as possible so that staff do not get disillusioned and they can see that change is ahead of them and new working methods coming before them. We have made some suggestions that are reflected in the question tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to disrupt that process. On the other hand when you send us the elements of the Staff Regulations, as legislators we need to make sure that those changes to the rules are going to work in favour of good administration and not against it. You made out the case persuasively, as it says in our report, that in many cases the current Staff Regulations are deficient in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have tabled tonight goes to what we regard – and I hope that you will share our opinion – as the very heart of the reforms you are putting together. The achievement should be an organisation in which advancement is on merit, an organisation in which all members of staff in the Commission know that they have clear goals, know what those goals are, know that if they meet or exceed those goals their performance is going to be fully recognised. They should know that they work in an organisation in which appraisals of their performance are not bureaucratic exercises that are carried out every two years and put in a filing cabinet and not referred to again, that the appraisal process is part of the overall quality of management and processes within the Commission, part of giving all members of staff the feeling that it is part of their personal development. It is setting them goals, it is identifying the need for training for development, for promotion and identifying the things that they need to do to contribute to the development of themselves and to the organisation overall.</p>
<p class="contents">That question of appraisal links very strongly to an aspect of the reforms about which we know you are engaged in heavy discussions at the moment. I hope you will not mind if I mention that tonight even though it is not part of our question. That is the question of career structure and your proposals to move to a linear career structure. It is clear that appraisal and career structure are inextricably linked together. It is my argument – and indeed that was expressed in my report and supported by colleagues – that if the appraisal and development system works properly there are no obstacles to achieving the linear career structure – and that is the whole thrust of what you are trying to do. There should be no reason for setting artificial barriers to people's progress through an organisation. If there is a need for qualifications or training to move to the next job the development process will identify that. And so a properly designed and effective appraisal system, which we have asked you a number of questions about in the question we have tabled, is also linked very strongly to that move, and indeed it is the very foundation of a linear career structure as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mrs Guy-Quint, is going to cover all the detailed budgetary questions with her considerable expertise in that subject, but I would just like to mention two final elements of our questions, to set them in context. The first is one that we have specifically asked you about as an aspect of a modern public organisation: a policy for whistle-blowing – and the English terminology is now being widely accepted as a very good way of identifying a policy where officials believe and are confident that if they find wrongdoing they can report it without fear of recrimination or their careers being affected. The second links in with a debate we will be having later this week on the code of administrative behaviour: how do you see that as an integral part of the overall reforms?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion we very much look forward to hearing your responses this evening and also your reassurance that the reforms are proceeding to plan as you would wish. We hope you will also identify ways in which you would like more support from this House in what is for us an absolutely crucial development for the future of the Commission and indeed for the future of Europe itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy-Quint (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what Mr Harbour has just said, I will now very briefly talk about technical problems of concern to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I would nonetheless like to tell you, Commissioner, that I am delighted with the advances that have been made in the area of cooperation since our last meeting in a plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact I, in addition to many other Members, regret that the Commission should make proposals and generate information, but does not really consult the other institutions, the trade union organisations or the staff committees of these institutions. Now, since February, my prayers have been answered, because this procedure, thankfully, has been given a great deal of attention and has been widely listened to by the institutions you are currently consulting. I know that you will notice that a wide consensus has been reached on many proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I would like to say something quite different to my colleague Mr Harbour. It turns out that there are still two delicate points for us to consider in these negotiations. To be precise, the structure of careers, that is to say linearity, or else the status quo, and also the pensions system. If, recently, I understood you correctly, it appears that you are currently searching for a compromise between these two career systems. It is my personal wish that a realistic and modern proposal will be found through your negotiations. I would also remind you that as far as pensions are concerned, even if very often it is thought that a pensions system by pre-funding is the way forward, there are many of us, the trade unionists, employees and others, who think that the current system of distribution can be upheld or in any case combined.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come back to budgetary concerns relating to the reform. Firstly, and as a matter of precaution, I have to remind you that the implementation of a system for early retirement has not received Parliament’s endorsement other than upon the specific condition of budgetary neutrality, wherever it may be implemented. In relation to the entirety of the reform, we would therefore wait for, as soon as is possible, a complete document stating the budgetary aspect of the current negotiations. It is therefore very important that the Committee on Budgets should have better knowledge of your current predictions on the global cost of reform. In fact, in March we heard talk of EUR 500 million. Today, EUR 600 million is stated. In addition, further measures proposed and the demands of other institutions have put a large strain on the funds required for the balance of category 5, hence our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element of doubt that makes the 2002 budgetary decision more complex is Council’s failure to respond to the 2001 letter of Amendment No 1 on the implementation of early retirement schemes. If the Council still insists on its proposal to raise the age for early retirement, we have a question: what will be the consequences for your draft, and, more importantly, do you think that it would be wise to continue under these conditions? We do not currently have a document that allows Parliament to measure the consequences of these positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are very attached to the idea of reform, we cannot make blind decisions on choices that are so technically, humanely and financially important. To decide in this way would be like signing a blank cheque to the Commission, which is not in our nature. To this day, we can only remark that the preliminary draft budget put forward by the Commission exceeds the category 5 ceilings of 5 million and that Council is now putting forward a draft budget where these ceilings are most certainly respected, with a margin of 58 million, but where all the policies of the different institutions would not, as a result of this, be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution: should category 5 support the two largest projects – enlargement and the cost of reform – on its own? Should we continue these efforts solely on reform or also on enlargement? In any case, we need a response. Would it not be possible to extend reform over a longer period? On the eve of voting on the draft budget, we are aware that the responses you provide clearly depend on so many pieces of the same puzzle, but it is very important that you clarify matters in order for us to make a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I hope the House will understand, providing detailed replies to every part of this oral question this evening would take up all the time allocated to the debate. I am therefore making a full progress report on all individual reform actions available today to honourable Members in written form. Perhaps some honourable Members will have received that full report and here I will concentrate on the most salient recent developments with the human resources policy elements of our reform strategy and I also refer, as requested by Madam Guy-Quint, particularly to the budgetary issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I first report, without any complacency, that in the five months since the Commission adopted the detailed consultative document on reform and modernisation of human resources policy, progress has been sustained and progress has been satisfactory. The joint high-level group chaired by the former Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Niels Ertsbøl been particularly useful in facilitating a very thorough constructive and productive process of consultation with staff representatives. The Commission has conveyed its warm thanks to Mr Ertsbøl.</p>
<p class="contents">In consultations and negotiations on the complex matters of personnel policy, it is natural of course that some delays have been experienced. I am very glad to say, however, that they have not been of a nature or of a length likely to cause any severe disruption to the reform schedule. As I previously emphasised to the House, and Mr Harbour has repeatedly and in my view rightly emphasised too, the Commission is aware of the need to sustain the momentum of change, not only in the interests of the institution but also in the interests of our personnel and of the public which we serve. We are sure that we can maintain the necessary pace while simultaneous achieving the understanding and the support required for fully effective implementation of the essential changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, the Commission adopted a document on 18 July entitled 'New orientations for the reform of personnel policy'. This has been communicated to Parliament but of course because Parliament rose at roughly the time we were producing that document, there was not an opportunity to formally bring it before Parliament at that juncture. The document includes a timetable for the completion of the current negotiations. By the end of this year the Commission will be in a position to adopt finalised decisions on all issues that do not require changes to the Staff Regulations and also to present a formal proposal for a revised set of Staff Regulations to the interinstitutional Staff Regulations Committee. We hope that the intensive consultations undertaken with the Secretaries-General and Presidents of this Parliament and of the other institutions will facilitate the support that is essential to the changes that are necessary to fulfil, I remind the House, the clear reform mandate given specifically to the Prodi Commission by this House and by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appreciates the supportive purposes of honourable Members in their reference in this oral question to implementation of the new career development policy ahead of formal agreement. We advise the House, however, that such efforts would be certain to attract formal complaints and court cases and therefore lead to delays and indeed to unnecessary ill will. We will therefore continue to fully observe the conciliation agreement which we reached with the staff representatives in March. In any event, as the July timetable shows, discussions with Commission staff representatives will be concluded in the near future and many substantial changes in personnel policy that do not require amendment to the Staff Regulations will then be decided by the Commission and implemented immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to report that the basic objective of our February proposals, of which we are again reminded by Mr Harbour, of directly linking career advancement to proven merit has been accepted in the negotiations to date. Changes in detail made as a result of negotiation and consultation have, I am glad to say, produced improvements in the proposal. Details relating to these matters and to Mr Harbour's questions on benchmarking, appraisal, management and pensions are available in the progress report which I am circulating to the House today. To save time I therefore turn to the concluding part of the question put by Mr Harbour and Madam Guy-Quint relating to budgetary matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I note the reference in the question to EUR 600 million as 'a cost reform' and I must say that the House is in danger of accidentally misleading itself. It is essential to stress with maximum emphasis that a clear distinction must be made between the costs of meeting the Commission's carefully measured request for 717 new posts including 118 posts in Delegations, submitted in the amending letter last September, and the far smaller gross costs of investing in reform. The new posts needed to enable the Commission to fulfil its policy and operational obligations to 2006, set out in fine detail in the amending letter and accompanying documents, will cost around EUR 542 million. The gross cost of personnel policy reform to 2006 will be around EUR111.9 million. The largest part of additional human resources spending is therefore not related to any significant extent to the design and implementation of the reform strategy. I underline the fact that neither the request for Commission posts, nor any of the Commission's reform proposals, would cause a breach of the limitations set down under heading 5 of the 1999 financial perspectives and the Commission will fulfil the undertakings to stay within the limitations which we volunteered last year both to this House and to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Mrs Guy-Quint mentioned, the House should take account of the fact – as a table I am also circulating today demonstrates – that recent proposals made by institutions other than the Commission would have the effect of significantly increasing the forecast rates of growth of expenditure on personnel and administration under Heading 5. The institutions which are at present contemplating an above-average rate of growth in Heading 5 expenditure will doubtless want to give further attention to this matter. It is conceivable that part of the estimates which they are making relate to the anticipated costs associated with enlargement. That is a matter of interest and requires a focus from all of us. The fact remains that, as things stand at the moment, any danger of breaching Heading 5 of the financial perspective emanates entirely, solely and completely from the ambitions of institutions other than the Commission and has absolutely nothing to do with the modest and temporary proposals that we make for additional investment associated with reform, which is a fundamental mission of the Prodi Commission, given to us by the overwhelming majority of this House and the unanimous decision of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Although discussions with staff representatives are not yet concluded, the Commission wishes to emphasise that as examination of all relevant figures will show – and the relevant figures are in the documents that I have circulated today and in the document adopted by the Commission on 18 July – the increase in yearly expenditure under Heading 5 generated by Commission reform will be modest and temporary. The figures published in the new orientations document in July show the maximum yearly increase due to reform – if the measures were adopted by all institutions – would be EUR 34.3 million higher in 2005 than in 2001. Thereafter, after 2005, the cost will actually decrease, leading to permanent savings of EUR 23.5 million by comparison with 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking those factors into account and in specific answer to the question before the House, the Commission considers that our reform strategy does not require that we request a revision of the ceiling of Heading 5 and we will not make such a request. Obviously following from that, we do not consider that it is sensible or necessary to make what would be a false distinction between urgent and less-urgent aspects of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of staging the reform over a longer period, I simply remind the House that first of all, a substantial part of the House argues – rightly in my view – for sustained momentum of change, for the sake of our staff as well as for the sake of the institutions. Secondly, it was the explicit mandate of the Prodi Commission – not any other Commission – to undertake and achieve the reforms in its quinquennium. We certainly intend to do that. At EUR 111 million, over four years, with investments that would result in actual cost savings, as we have demonstrated, none of the reform investment is expensive. All of the reform investment is essential. There is no question of our seeking or accepting a blank cheque. Every argument that we have made, every figure that we have put, every proposition that we have tabled is carefully calculated. We expect no-one to take anything on credit or on trust.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that negotiations on modernisation of the career system have led to a consensus about the objectives of changing the system and also about conditions for reforming the system. Those negotiations have not, however, yet produced agreement on the detailed practical means of implementing the sort of reform that is needed to produce a more continuous modern career structure. The prospects of gaining such an agreement are, however, very much alive, I am glad to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past weeks in August, work has therefore continued in order to produce fresh and detailed models and options, which will be the subject of resumed discussions with staff representatives and with other institutions this month. It is realistic to anticipate that by the end of October the Commission will be in a position to take a final view of the whole of the human resource policy reforms, including a career structure that is more linear and in the best professional interests of the permanent and independent European public service. To turn such proposals into reality the understanding and support of Parliament, both as a democratic assembly and as an employing institution, will be essential. I am optimistic that support and understanding will be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Harbour reminded us, last November the large majority of this House gave support to his report which explicitly favoured the principle of making significant change – not the status quo or anything like it – in order to establish a more linear career system for the European civil service, for all the reasons he was kind enough to set out again tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that such a positive stance will be maintained by the House and by the administration which serves the House. Negative attitudes would frustrate the will of this House that was clearly expressed by a huge majority in September 1999, in November 2000 and on several other occasions. The reason that the will of this House would be frustrated by negative attitudes is that these would impede or prevent the Commission from making changes which are at the core of the modernising reform that has been explicitly required by the Council, by Parliament and by the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the constructive and cooperative attitude to reform that has repeatedly been manifested by this House will continue strongly and consistently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to welcome her and congratulate her on recently becoming a mother.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kinnock, there is a Spanish phrase which says, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’. You have a very difficult task and I have the impression that, in order to progress from intentions to actions, you must put your foot down and take risks, as President Prodi promised us when he began his five-year mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">There are issues of budgetary control which I would like you to expand on in your written reply.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember that, a year ago, you told us that eighty officials were expected for the central auditing service to begin work in full in April on an evaluation of the management and control system. We do not know whether this is yet under way. We do not know whether centralised prior approval is yet under way insofar as a high degree of experience in the authorising bodies has been achieved. We do not know whether specific prior controls are operating, on the basis of a risk analysis and according to the wishes of the authorising officers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have great doubts, Mr Kinnock, about the future of the financial regulation, which must be created urgently. It will not be your exclusive responsibility, but we are very unclear about this. We are worried. You are going to produce a new version. When will this be? What is happening with the Convention on the protection of the Community’s financial interests? What is happening with the helpdesk which you were going to set up so that the measures in the White Paper could be consulted by officials? I could go on and on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the impression that the task is enormous, that there is a timetable to be created. You know that you have our support. We want you to take risks. We will support you if you make a mistake, as we supported Mr Prodi when he told us about it, but perhaps we need someone to put their foot down and timescales to be respected and promises to become realities, Mr Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite these obstacles, I have to say, having listened to the Commissioner, we have congratulate him on the progress that he has made so far and we also have to congratulate the staff trade union for having gone into negotiation and made headway in a number of areas of reform. It is important that this question is down here because I would like to touch on a couple of points that some of my colleagues have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour – rightly so – raised the question of timing. Timing is important because, if you get the timing wrong, it impacts on the morale of staff and once the morale of staff starts to fall then that has an impact on career improvements, advancement, etc., and once that starts – they do not move forward. All these points go together.</p>
<p class="contents">I was glad that Mr Harbour touched on the question of the linear career structure, it is a big issue and one that we have to face up to as the Commissioner is well aware. I would add that I agree that whistle-blowing is now in the public knowledge. However, whistle-blowing has a different ramification in the west of Scotland: it tends to indicates flutes and that does not go down too well in my part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I slightly disagree with my colleague Mrs Guy-Quint. On the question of consultation: we have been consulted at every opportunity. She did argue again for a more protracted period of reform, but as we said, if we spin it out longer and longer it impacts upon the morale of the staff and that impacts on the performance of the staff. We have to keep this as short as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole question of retirement: I was the person responsible for piloting the question of the retirement package through Parliament and it is a wonderful package. I would love to be offered the same. Can I say to the Commissioner, we heard quite clearly about the breaking of the Heading 5 ceiling. We realise that it is not in the domain of the Commission and maybe it is high time that some of us were to look at some of the other institutions and how they were getting on with on with that.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have made significant progress. It is important that we are kept informed of the progress. I am glad to hear what the Commissioner said, because only by that and by monitoring what is happening can we have an impact. If obstacles do occur, we can then start trying to tackle them, here and in the other institutions as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no easy task you have embarked upon, and it is therefore important for Parliament to offer its full support. It has, of course, been a widespread feature of society over the last few years that organisations have been obliged to re-think the way they organise their work in order to maintain competitiveness and exploit the opportunities offered by modern technology and public administration and, in so doing, give the electorate full value for their tax contributions. Moreover, it is precisely the electorate that has a lot of difficulty understanding why the EU’s institutions maintain such a rigid and old-fashioned personnel policy in which promotions are made on the basis of very formal criteria rather than on the basis of effort. There is no grass-roots understanding of why EU employees do not have to meet the demands for fresh thinking, flexibility and adaptation that apply in the rest of society.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to support the Commission’s proposal for the linear career structure which has been mentioned quite a few times this evening and in which promotions are made on the basis of ability and effort. I should also like to regret the fact that, in a letter to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the President of the European Parliament in actual fact went against Parliament’s own views on this point, as expressed in the Harbour report. Moreover, I hope that this has not created too much in the way of difficulties for the Commission in the negotiations. It is vital that the Commission’s reforms should involve a personnel policy that rewards commitment, hard work and adaptability, and that is something we must support. Against that background, I shall look forward to the Commission’s compromise proposal for a career structure. I should also like to acknowledge the Commissioner’s pointing out what is creating the problems in Heading 5. I think that remark was rather apposite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr Kinnock, two years ago, in September 1996, Parliament conferred upon the Prodi/Kinnock Commission a very clear mandate: reform. Two years have passed since then, Mr Kinnock, and – as far as I am aware – the only reform which you have implemented is to take the gold medal for 20 years of service away from civil servants, which, in all sincerity, does not seem to amount to much. In Italy, there was a Ministry of Public Administration Reform for 20 years, and then they removed the word ‘reform’ because it was becoming rather ridiculous that reforms were taking 20 years and it became the Ministry of Public Administration, full stop. It would appear that this reform – and it is not by chance that Mr Pomés Ruiz mentioned the Financial Regulation – is, so to speak, just a castle in the air: we have been talking about it for two years but I feel that all the proposals are raising difficulties and a whole range of problems. Therefore, I wonder when this reform will come to an end, when there will be an end to this discontent. I am sure you are not unaware of the fact that the European officials are not too happy with the way things are going. I am not going to defend them as a corporation, but I will say that this matter is serious because it was the task of this Commission to reinvigorate the European public administration. In my opinion, rather than reinvigorating it, the Commission is scouring it out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, we all know how difficult it is to reform an administration: it is basically a case of replacing the current equilibrium, which is grounded in the inertia and routine of years and of habit with one that is different; excellent in principle but uncharted territory and always experimental in practice. This is, of course, a daunting challenge, and one that we welcome. For this reason in principle we support, without writing a blank cheque, of course, the initiative for the reform of the Commission. It is, however, worth remembering that this is not simply an administrative reform, but also a political reform, where in addition to the traditional balances it is necessary to be safeguard the traditional European institutional balance, in which issues of power are raised that cannot be dealt with in the same way as a reform of a more neutral nature.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is our main cause for concern? First of all, we need to know whether we are heading towards a strengthening of independence and autonomy in European public service, and I can offer good advice to those taking the decision on this matter, or whether the discretionary nature of career progression privatises the hierarchical relationship, making a European official very similar to an official in a multinational company. Furthermore, on what objective criteria are these competences to be awarded? How can we prevent merit from being watered down into benefits, into obedience to management, creating a structure of senior officials, some of whom will be quickly promoted, others more slow to rise up the ladder? And how can we prevent this polarity from taking on the form of national considerations, the defence of national interests, in opposition to the actual purpose of the Commission, which is responsible for protecting European interests? These are the political risks of these reforms, our fears and our concerns. It is your task, Commissioner Kinnock, and it requires your integrity and intellectual honesty to prove that these risks, these fears and concerns are unfounded. The onus of proof, however, is on the Commission and specifically on Commissioner Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will now try to be as brief as I possibly can in response to the very good points that have been made by honourable Members in the course of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps if I try to go through the more salient points made and simply make the most brief answers that will assist the House, especially against the background of the fact that in their post today and probably in their offices already, there is a very comprehensive lengthy reply to every aspect of the oral question set down by Mr Harbour and Madam Guy-Quint and secondly a very full table of 23 pages going through each of the 98 actions for reform proposals and giving a detailed account of the state of play on each of those at the moment, whether those proposals have been completed and implemented, which several have, or whether they are currently the subject of consultation or whether they have been presented to this House, or to the Council, or both, for the legislative amendment required to put them into effect. All the honourable Members, including Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Dell'Alba and others who have enquiries of that kind can, simply by referring to that table, get the most up-to-date information available to any one in the European Union, including the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Harbour's questions relating to whistle-blowing and to the code of good administrative behaviour, obviously we require changes to the Staff Regulations in order to secure the necessary advances on the existing legislation relating to the duty to report suspected wrongdoing that has an effect on the financial wellbeing of the European Communities. The proposal has been made in detailed form. We are now seeking the cooperation of the Council and Parliament in the course of consideration of the modernisation of the Staff Regulations next year. I am optimistic that this cooperation will be forthcoming. The result will be that the European public service will have the best and most secure provision for safeguarding the interests of staff and the institutions and the European public of any public administration anywhere in the European Union. As far as the code of administrative behaviour is concerned, the principles of that code are already set down in the Staff Regulations. In day-to-day practice, since we have implemented the code, the answer to the question on the oral paper today about whether the code of administrative behaviour is in practice incorporated in the activities of the Commission is yes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the career structure question, it appears that people have either adopted misinformed views or been given misleading opinions. I assure the House that the intention behind the reform generally, and specifically the intention behind the proposals we have made in relation to career structure, is not to try to emulate some form of private sector multinational. It is to establish, to make an assessment upon, to recognise merit and to provide reward in the development of an individual's career according to the very best principles of accountable, efficient, independent, professional civil services at European Union level. No more no less. If anyone is trying to give the impression that we are trying to set official against official, to destroy the contribution of loyalty made by officials over the years, to overlook the individual qualities of individuals by making the proposal that we do, they are sadly misled.</p>
<p class="contents">I am prepared to go into the most thorough detail in order to ensure that we do not get any repetition of the misunderstanding that has led to various communications that have manifested a complete failure to comprehend the purpose and detail of what has been proposed so far. I am very glad to say that in the Commission the staff unions, or a majority of the unions representing Commission staff members, have gone into these issues in the most thorough detail and have actually developed attitudes and ideas that can lead to significant improvements on the original propositions and options that were put.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the basis of that constructive dialogue and negotiation, which has lasted over the past five months, that we are now putting refreshed and reconsidered options which I hope will recommend themselves not only to staff in the Commission but to the other institutions. There is nothing to fear and there is everything for the staff, the institutions and the public interest to gain by the modernisation of the career structure of the European Union institutions from the inherited structure which is over 40 years old. Everything else in the European Union has changed and it is time that the career structure and the recognition of commitment and capability caught up with those other changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I say to Mr Pomés Ruiz that the answers to the questions that he has raised, for instance on audit, are available in a number of documents which have been conveyed to Parliament. But for quick and easy reference, I draw his attention to the set of tables that he will have in his office today or at the very latest tomorrow – I suspect that they are there today – which will give him complete and up-to-date details on each of the aspects of reform relating to the establishment, development and operation, for instance, of the internal audit service.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Miller refers to timing. That is an apposite point. Our commitment to sustained momentum is nothing to do with any desire to rush the Commission, its staff, Parliament, the Council or anybody else. The point is that in managing very substantial change that affects our institutions and the people who work for them it is in nobody's interests to delay, evade, or unnecessarily prolong the deliberations. Let those deliberations be thorough and the negotiations candid and well-informed. But when the prospect of change hangs over people's heads it can be destabilising, demoralising and demotivating, which is in nobody's interests. That is why we are not rushing. These changes are being considered properly and democratically in a process of consultation and negotiation. We have honoured every commitment on that and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the early retirement package mentioned by Mr Miller, the package we have now has retained its attractiveness for staff and its cost neutrality. We have kept our promises. What we need now is for the Council to act quickly and effectively, because the increased efficiency and cost neutrality and the benefit to the operation of the European Union that can derive from the Commission's proposal last year could be drastically reduced or even lost altogether if any part of the Council prevaricates. That is not in anybody's interests. I take Mrs Jensen's point: what we are proposing is to link effort to recognised assessment and reward.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have covered Mr Marinho's point relating to the nature of what we are seeking to do, which is consistent with principles of public service, but now I come to Mr Dell'Alba's point about language. He is a Member of this House for whom I have great respect despite our political differences. His point about language hegemony was a cheap point, which regrettably diminishes my respect for him, and what he says has absolutely no foundation at all in anything that I or my fellow Commissioners have said or done. He might have intended it as a joke but I do not think that in the European Union of 2001 we should joke about things like that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been told that, in the two years we have had as a Commission, the only reform has been to get rid of the medal for 20 years' service. But when I look back over these two years I see that we have kept promises to establish, for the first time ever, an independent, professionally led and staffed internal audit service, a central finance service, audit capabilities in every directorate-general, an audit progress committee that bears comparison with any comparable mechanism in the private or public sector anywhere in the European Union. We have drafted a new financial regulation which came to this House on time and to the Council on time and we are waiting for its enactment. We have developed a strategic planning and programming system. It is capable, with the use of activity-based budgeting and management, of being implemented in the European Commission, on time, provided that we get the necessary support from elsewhere. On time, in keeping with the promises we made on 1 March 2000 we have set out the most complex and extensive set of proposed reforms for personnel management and conduct in the European Commission and European public service comparable to the work that has been undertaken in the administrations of Member States over five and ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a slur on the people who work in the Commission and the huge commitment that they have shown, in working 75 hours a week or more, month after month, to suggest that this Commission has done nothing in two years. I will not tolerate that kind of attack on the officials of the Commission and the way in which they have demonstrated their dedication to the public interest by seeking to fulfil the mandate given to the Commission by this elected House.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not finished the reform. It will be some time before we have even implemented the mechanisms of reform, let alone securing the changes in attitudes, conventions, behaviour and so-called ‘culture’ that will result. One group of people really does deserve credit: the civil servants of the European Union, both those who have contributed to the design and development of the reform programme and those who, in a time of turmoil, have shown patience, understanding and commitment in thinking up the ideas, considering the proposals being made, suggesting improvements and showing the goodwill that demonstrates a high standard of professional commitment to the cause of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue along that path, hopefully with the cooperation and constructive support of Members of this House and the Council. But if in the end we do not succeed in making all the changes that are needed in the time available, one thing I want to ensure is that every tax-paying citizen and every voter in the European Union understands that a failure to meet the targets and deadlines is in no way the responsibility of the European Commission or the people who work for it. The responsibility for failing to fulfil the mandate lies elsewhere – maybe with the very institutions that gave us the mandate in September 1999. I would much prefer to be able to show people in the Member States that Parliament, the Council and the Commission heard and heeded the demands for change and modernisation and have worked together to bring about the changes needed to ensure that the citizens of Europe have the high quality, efficient, transparent and professional administration they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and its staff have committed themselves to that. I hope that this House will continue to show the same commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I read in <span class="italic">La Stampa</span> on 15 August that Mr Védrine and Mr Fischer had been complaining. I wanted to make an understatement and, as the Commissioner has pointed out, it is difficult to make a joke in a language that is not one’s own. I failed and I apologise. It was, of course, a joke, as the Commissioner said. The rest is clearly a different matter and I respect what the Commissioner has said. My comment referred purely to the first part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
