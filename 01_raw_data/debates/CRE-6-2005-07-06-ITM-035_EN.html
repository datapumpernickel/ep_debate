I am sure we all agree that quality compensates for quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgent item concerns the elections that took place in Bulgaria on 25 June this year. It is in the interest of Bulgaria to rapidly form a stable coalition government capable of delivering on the reforms necessary for EU accession. Whichever coalition is formed, work must continue in Bulgaria towards meeting all commitments made during the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that there is a broad consensus across the party political spectrum on this objective. The new government should present an EU integration programme for implementation on all pending issues. I also note that President Parvanov yesterday signed a degree recalling the Parliament for Monday, 11 July, even though, under the Constitution, he had until 25 July to do so. So, encouragingly, there are serious efforts to keep the preparations moving on and to limit as far as possible the interruption caused by the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We also understand that there are plans to keep the Parliament working through the summer holiday period to allow progress in the key areas of accession preparations. In my speech to the Bulgarian Parliament some weeks ago, I encouraged the members of the Bulgarian Parliament to use part of their summer holidays for urgent legislative work and take off for the Black Sea coast only once the EU-related work has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the response was positive and glad to find this kind of European motivation in Bulgaria. It is the sovereign decision of the European Parliament to decide on the granting of observer status. However, representatives from Bulgaria and Romania can play a key role in informing their citizens on EU matters, as well as informing us about their countries. That is a case in point of the evolving European democracy, which is a very dear objective to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the closing of negotiations in December 2004, both Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress in meeting the accession requirements. However, the Commission’s ongoing monitoring exercise clearly shows that they can spare no efforts. Ensuring compliance with the accession requirements by January 2007 will pose a real challenge over the next 17 months. Every day, every week and every month counts for both Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">For Bulgaria, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, the environment and agriculture will be of decisive importance. Similarly, in the case of Romania, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, especially the reform of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption, competition and state aid, the environment and agriculture will be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, the Commission sent early warning letters or ‘yellow cards’ to both Bulgaria and Romania in which we indicated areas of serious shortcomings. There were five such areas for Bulgaria and seven for Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, for the moment the jury is still out. The Commission will continue to monitor both countries’ progress closely and there is a constant flow of Commissioners and Commission officials to both Bulgaria and Romania. They are there not for fun but for serious monitoring and the Commission relies on its characteristic objectivity and professionalism in the monitoring exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The next significant step will be the comprehensive monitoring report, which will be issued on 25 October. That will be an extremely crucial checkpoint for both Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I will underline what both President Barroso and I have said, which reflects the position of the Commission. If necessary, the Commission would not hesitate to recommend the use of the safeguard clauses of postponement provided for in the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why are we having this debate? We are having it because the Conference of Presidents, having already decided to invite representatives from Romania and Bulgaria to come, one year ahead of their countries’ accessions, to observe the work of this House and take part in it, suddenly reviewed the decision and – the Social Democrats having changed their minds – overturned it. We are having this debate because, when the Conference’s resolution was revised, a date was set that anticipated the Commission’s progress report and hence also the naming of a final date for the countries’ accession, which means that they, and the countries that joined us in 2004, are not being treated equally. We are also having it because the President of this House failed, on Monday, to inform us of the fact that he had already sent them a letter of invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue has never been about when the accession of Bulgaria and Romania is to take place. The political decision has been taken. Now that we have decided what to do, nobody wants to apply the brakes. Like most of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I voted in favour of the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria being 1 January 2007; what happens after that has also been decided. The facts of the situation do, though, lead me to regard the decision by the Conference of Presidents as both premature and wrong. I find it particularly regrettable that the President, on Monday, withheld from us important information concerning his actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody wants to disinvite anyone we have already invited, and we look forward to having them working with us. Our sole concern was and is with the issue of whether we take ourselves seriously, of whether the matter in hand is more important than the date, of whether equal treatment is more important than the small change of day-to-day politics. The question of how we treat one another and the candidates for accession is too important to be handled with so much emotion, and to be the subject of so much disinformation, as we have seen from our competitors and rivals in this House since Monday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from Hungary, one of the new Member States that was able to participate as an observer in the work of Parliament from the time the Accession Treaty was signed. We would like the same to happen now, too. Given that both Romania and Bulgaria signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April, the road has been open for them too – in my view – from that day onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The other comment I would like to make to my fellow Member, relates to ’how seriously we take ourselves’. The Conference of Presidents – a body democratically elected by us in this House – decided on 9 June to send the letter of invitation to the representatives of the two countries in question. I therefore think that we will be taking ourselves seriously if we keep our word regarding this letter, and actually welcome our new colleagues warmly to the Parliament from 26 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from this, it is my opinion that on 25 October, when the monitoring report is issued, it would be a pleasure (for you too, I am sure,) if our fellow representatives were able to participate as observers in the work of the sitting. After all, it is only by doing this that they will be able to take home first-hand news of areas where there are still shortcomings. Only by being here with us will they be able to obtain first-hand information regarding their progress in eliminating the shortcomings mentioned by Commissioner Olli Rehn, on the legislative work under way all summer in Bulgaria, and on the implementation of existing legislation. If they know what the problem is and how to solve it; if they know what proposals are being put forward (or reservations expressed) concerning them by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) or European Democrats or by the other side; if they are here and we are able to work together with them. This is why I think we should welcome them, and I agree with what Commissioner Olli Rehn said regarding preparedness. Eighteen months is indeed a long time. We had less time, but the biggest reservation concerning these two countries continues to be that they are less advanced in terms of meeting the accession requirements than the ten countries that most recently acceded. For this reason, I think that in their case eighteen months is not a long time. By the time of their accession on 1 January 2007, they must learn how to do the work that we do here, taking each other’s words into account and taking each other seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development and stability of the continent of Europe is to a large degree dependent on the simultaneous deepening and enlargement of the European Union. Particularly in the Balkans, every extra square metre of European soil that sustains democracy, the rule of law and human rights also adds to the space in which conflicts can be peacefully resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement must not, however, be taken too fast. Every country must fulfil the requisite accession criteria: not only on paper but also in practice, in a reality that the people can apprehend.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though Bulgaria and Romania have made great strides since the fall of their Communist regimes, I find it regrettable that neither has yet developed much in the way of a political culture. There are still too many problems involved in doing away with the cumbersome bureaucracy, despite the positive efforts that have been made to that end. What is worthy of criticism is the failure to make much headway in reforming the justice system, the widespread corruption in the police and the judiciary, considerable shortfalls in the integration of minorities, the poor economic development and social and environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The shocking success of the extreme right-wing Ataka party in the Bulgarian elections, which got into parliament with 8% of the vote, has done nothing to improve the overall political climate. It is to be feared that this will make the task of forming a government more difficult and further slow the progress of reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that we send a signal to those who hold responsibility in both countries. Unlike most members of my group, I am persuaded that we should invite observers to this House only after the progress report has appeared and a decision on accession has been taken. We should make clear to the governments in Bucharest and Sofia the fact that major reforms are still needed and that the sprint down the home straight to accession will not be accomplished without effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me start by pointing out that it was not the plenary that took this decision, but the Conference of Presidents. This is a highly political decision, and so there cannot fail to be some doubts about this. The proper place for decisions such as this one is in this plenary and in broad daylight, and it is not very democratic for them to be taken by the Conference of Presidents and behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, Mr Horáček is quite right to draw attention to the continuing deficiencies in the processes of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession. We all want Romania and Bulgaria to become Member States of the EU; about that there is not the slightest doubt. If, though, we impose conditions on their accession, we must ourselves take those conditions seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that one reason why the results from the French and Dutch referenda were so devastating was that many members of the public get the impression that, although we attach conditions to a country’s accession, we do not ourselves take those conditions seriously. That is why the enlargement process has got completely out of hand; the fact is that we cannot cope with enlarging the EU and deepening it both at the same time, and we must now be very firm in giving priority to deepening it. Even so, it sent the wrong message to invite these countries to send observers over a year before an accession the date for which has not yet been fixed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, after all, quite possible – as the Commissioner himself has just hinted – that accession will be put back a year in consequence of the situation that Mr Horáček has described so accurately. Are the observers, then, to be with us in this House for two and a half years? That would surely be inappropriate, to say the least, and so the right thing to do would indeed be to take the decision only once the progress report has been produced. It is for that reason that we want to discuss that now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can provide a solution to many as yet unresolved problems; many Romanian children – both Roma and non-Roma – may be freed from the dangers of poverty as a result; environmental protection, including the issue of Rosia Montana (Verespatak) may – I hope – be resolved in a European manner. Perhaps Romania’s Hungarian minority may even gain independence. Parliament must play a key role in this process. We must be rigorous in calling Romania to account, as problems are not solved by sweeping them under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s progress report in October provides the last chance to resolve any dilemmas that persist. The issue is such a serious one and our task so laden with responsibility that we cannot allow it to become the subject of political jousting between parties. The accession process must not be allowed to stall. At the same time, accession is only really meaningful if every citizen of Romania gains from it – including the 1.7 million-member Hungarian minority. For this to become a reality in everyday life, and not just a pretty catch-phrase, compliance with the accession commitments is crucial. It is this that will bring the much-needed modernisation to Romania at every level. This is why your responsibility is huge, Commissioner, when preparing the report, and so is ours as a Parliament, when it comes, we hope, to deciding once again on the report. These are the really crucial issues. As you said, Commissioner, ‘every day, every week, every month counts’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that, as Parliament’s rapporteur on Bulgaria, I was not consulted or even informed about any suggestion that parliamentary observers should be delayed or indeed that some fresh emphasis should be placed on the possibility of delaying Bulgaria’s accession until 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Brussels on 21 June, attended by Commissioner Rehn, I asked for and received an assurance of the commitment to the timetable for enlargement, in spite of the failure of the European Constitution. I recall the Commissioner’s words that Bulgaria and Romania were the last enlargement, not the next enlargement. Their accession is guaranteed. The question, perhaps, is when exactly?</p>
<p class="contents">We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria is to be ready by 2007, but the task is eminently achievable. The one mechanism for delaying accession is the safeguard clause. In the case of Bulgaria, unlike Romania, this would require a unanimous decision of the Council. I see no merit, therefore, in raising any false spectre of delay. I remain optimistic that Bulgaria will accede on 1 January 2007. I have always underlined the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits and that the fates of Bulgaria and Romania should not be inextricably tied together. It is widely accepted that Bulgaria has fewer problems than Romania. I am only too aware that the elections in Bulgaria on 25 June have produced an unclear result. The process of building a government coalition is urgently under way, with a view to convening the Parliament on 11 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate tonight merely adds to uncertainty, both in government circles and among the citizens of Bulgaria. They are even beginning to think they are not wanted. I strongly reassured them. What is required in Bulgaria is continuity, stability, commitment and clarity, not uncertainty and negativism.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the observers – and I hope you will bear with me as the rapporteur for Bulgaria – I agree with the Commissioner and thank him when he says that the arrangements for the observers are a matter for this Parliament. It was confirmed to me in writing just two weeks ago on 16 June by the leader of the PPE-DE Group. He said as follows: ‘The Conference of Presidents has decided on its last meeting to invite the observers from both accession countries Romania and Bulgaria to join the European Parliament for the September II session in Strasbourg’, which means from 26 September onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Observers from last year’s ten accession states had been invited to join us as soon as possible after signature of the Accession Treaty. That is the precedent we should follow. Any other decision would send an unhelpful signal to our Bulgarian and Romanian friends. I very much look forward to welcoming them here in September as observers and as full Members from January 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The week before, our Parliament’s JPC delegation, chaired by my group colleague Mr Podestà, visited our Romanian parliamentary colleagues and met with the President, the Prime Minister and the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 June the Conference of Presidents sent the invitation to the Romanian and Bulgarian Parliaments to nominate their European Parliament observers and for them to take up their duties on 26 September. Last week I was invited to return to Bucharest to address the appointed observers. I regret the European Parliament appears just now not to have maintained a consistent common approach, and that my own Group at present may not be wholly associated with the joint motion for a resolution to be voted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the privilege of belonging to the PPE Group for over 15 years. It is a privilege I firmly intend to preserve. I hope, even at this hour, we may come back to a common agreed position. We have given our word, expressed in our name by the President of our Parliament to the observers, that they should take up their duties from 26 September. If we were to go back on our word, what signal would that send to Romania; to those brave statesmen, politicians and public servants who are struggling to bring democracy, economic, administrative and legal reforms? They regard the prospect of EU membership as the guarantee that they will achieve their goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember the difficult history of these countries. In Bucharest, before the Senate House, opposite the Royal Palace, there is a memorial inscribed with the words ‘Glorie martirilor nostri’ dated December 1989. It commemorates the fact that over 1 000 young people, students and soldiers lost their lives demonstrating and defending the demands for freedom. How should we honour their memory? This moment of uncertainty in the EU is a time for our Parliament to show courage and perseverance. We have given our word. We intend to abide by it and welcome the Romanian observers as promised on 26 September this year so that together we may work for a further successful enlargement of our European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speed of the accession process depends solely on the candidate countries and we respect the efforts currently being made in Sofia and Bucharest to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the admission of observers to Parliament, however, I would echo precisely what Mr Nassauer said. We must step down from our ivory tower and consider the consequences of the decisions that we, and in particular the authorities of this Parliament, are taking. It is quite clear that we cannot accept observers prior to the Commission’s report, and that we cannot accept them for Romania and Bulgaria earlier than we did for the other accession countries, that is a year before the proposed date of accession. That is why we formally support the motion tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We consider it to be extremely opportune in both political and legal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, Mr President, Commissioner, that in general I think that, given the crisis that Europe is currently experiencing and the distrust and suspicion that many people are showing towards the European institutions, now is the time for consolidation and reflection, not a headlong rush forward. That is why I said myself that I was astounded at the way in which the Commission prepared the negotiating mandate with Turkey. I think that the European institutions are living a thousand leagues away from the reality of the European people. We must rejoin the reality of the European people, and to do that, Commissioner, we need to re-examine the negotiating mandate that you prepared with Turkey and, in order to re-examine it and to give us time to do so, we need to delay the opening of negotiations. Consolidation will mean more Europe. A headlong rush will mean a dispersed Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
