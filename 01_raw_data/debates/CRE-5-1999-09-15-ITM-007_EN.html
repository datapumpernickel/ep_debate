A fellow member of the European People’s Party described his Party as being friends of security, as if there were any enemies of security in this House! I think the problem is rather that many are not the friends of freedom and the law to the same extent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I also believe that the most pressing task consists of achieving the prerequisites for an area of freedom, security and justice, specifically a Charter of Fundamental Rights in Europe, because the important thing is not only to centralise the sensitive application of State and police authority, but also to europeanise the rights of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Cologne Summit has decided upon the proclamation of just such a European list of fundamental rights, a laudable intention. But when one looks at the manner in which this has been planned, then one can only, as a Member of Parliament, be shocked. The Council has – for what reasons, I do not understand – assumed total responsibility for this list of fundamental rights. There was no dialogue with the European Parliament. This is unacceptable, given that the European Parliament has the role of representing the peoples of Europe and is thus the original authority for such a Charter of Fundamental Rights. There can be no question of equivalence of legislative institutions in this process. The inclusion of national parliaments has involved only individual representatives, so there can be no question either of plurality of political tendencies in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">What is most worrying and most alarming is the scope of the undertaking. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe there is one thing we should not do and that is to fulfil the fundamental requirements of the citizens in appearance only. A proclamation of already existing rights is no Charter of Fundamental Rights, but political versemongering!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope that at the end of the temporary conference all Member States will ratify the setting up of the International Criminal Court so that the war criminals who are so prevalent today throughout the world can be prosecuted. In July 1998, 83 countries agreed to the establishment of an international court at a conference sponsored by the United Nations in Rome. Only four countries to date have ratified the Rome Statute: Trinidad and Tobago, Senegal, San Marino and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the International Criminal Court will encourage states to investigate and prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and will itself investigate and prosecute these crimes in certain circumstances. By addressing the issue of impunity and providing a fair forum for prosecutions, the court will help ease international tensions and promote peace and security, domestically and internationally.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, the Charter should be an independent declaration of rights. When the Charter is drawn up, it is important to bear in mind that immigration policy within the European Union must take account of the Member States’ various social systems and educational opportunities. This applies especially if the Charter is to include citizens from non-EU countries who are resident within the European Union. In that way, the particular level of social protection is related more clearly to immigration and asylum policy. If too great a proportion of publicly financed social and economic entitlements were introduced, the walls shutting off the outside world would also be raised at the same time as the level of social provision in the European Union increases. This would mean that a caring approach to EU citizens would be to the detriment of those who really need protection within the EU’s borders, namely refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam introduces the concept of a European judicial area. If it is to be possible to use the term “judicial area”, then legal security must prevail there. To be able to measure how far along this road the Member States have come, criteria must be established and efficient methods of measurement created. It is a question of establishing convergence rules for legal security. Once convergence is established, a table of results ought to be drawn up for the purpose of making the Member States’ progress public. This would make the differences between the Member States clear. Group pressure is a strong social force which can contribute to voluntary harmonisation. If evaluation of this kind is fully open, efforts by the EU institutions may be that much more effective by promoting voluntary forms of harmonisation along the same lines. Once a process like this, aimed at establishing minimum rules, has begun, it should be possible to combine it with time limits and, in that way, provide the impetus towards creating a reliable area of justice which is a prerequisite if citizens are to be able to move freely, safely and securely and also a prerequisite for creating guarantees of security when the European Union is enlarged. This demands more effective safety and security measures, balanced with clearer definitions of personal integrity and human rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, the President-in-Office has said that if you were to ask the people in Member States what they want you would get a clear message. This Tampere motion is, I believe, part of that message. It is one example of the people’s agenda. If enacted at Tampere and enforced by Member State Governments it will show to some of our more Eurosceptic citizens that real progress is being made. Many of them are not really concerned about the extension of qualified majority voting, important as that is, but they are anxious for progress on citizens’ rights, progress on free movement, progress towards a real integrated Europe where people know and understand their rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">You pointed out the importance of this agenda when we are moving towards a successful enlargement of the European Union, setting our own House in order. Freedom, justice, security and transparency before we enlarge is, I am sure many would agree, absolutely crucial. It is a Europe that builds on what we have in common and does not set up barriers to highlight our differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier Mr Camre spoke against support for poorer countries. I say to him and others that you cannot have real prosperity and real security for 350 million people in 15 countries if you deny hope and similar rights to your neighbours. Walls, weapons and iron curtains are not the answer to asylum-seekers and refugees. That is why the success of the Tampere Summit and this resolution are so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Some UK Members on this side of the House may have reservations about one or two points but we fully believe in the principles of this resolution, the points that are practical and enforceable. I feel very optimistic that the Tampere Summit will not just be a positive step forward but will become a historically significant summit. I wish the Finnish presidency every success.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">May I also say to Madam President-in-Office that subsidiarity must be as vitally respected at Tampere as in all aspects of the work of this Union. I represent an electoral region which has had an independent legal system with a distinct tradition in justice and home affairs for over 500 years. It is not a Member State itself, but we in Scotland now have again a parliament which legislates for our justice and home affairs. It is vital that this and other such regions are fully and properly borne in mind when policies are developed dealing with these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree very much indeed with what Madam President-in-Office said about making rights effectual. It is no use having charters of rights and having rights enshrined in treaties if these are ignored in practice. It has been drawn to my attention, in the short time I have been in this House, that there are foreign language lecturers in Italy who for eleven years have had rights declared by the European Court of Justice effectively denied by a Member State of this Union. I hope that the Council and the Commission will take the strongest measures to ensure in this and other cases that we do not have rights and then see them rendered ineffectual by state action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this is what our citizens expect. They do not want to hear any more declarations, but they want us to take specific steps in order to allow progress in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In attempting to do so, with regard to the area of freedom, I believe that there are two issues which warrant preferential treatment: the harmonisation of asylum procedures and illegal immigration. To these two matters we should add temporary protection, which is an issue with great currency given the recent Kosovo crisis, and the internal solidarity between Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the area of security, I believe that it is reasonable to concentrate initially on those types of crime which are of a truly international nature. I refer to terrorism, drugs, organised crime and the trade in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Madam President, the means which should be used are three in number: police co-operation – bearing in mind the progress that has been made through the Schengen Agreement – the prevention of crime and external relations, given that security in the Union cannot be isolated from security in the rest of Europe and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must pay very special attention to the South, as well as to the countries adjacent to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the area of justice, our aim should be to do everything possible so that citizens have the sense of being, throughout Europe, within a framework of justice which is appropriate and within which their rights are protected in a similar way, not only with regard to criminals, but also with regard to the possible abuses of public power.</p>
<p class="contents">The European judicial network is, undoubtedly, the least developed of the three areas we are dealing with and, in this sense, I believe that the creation of a stable unit, charged with giving continuity to legal co-operation and acting as the judicial counterpart of Europol, would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, finally, Madam President, that the objectives of the European Council meeting in Tampere are very ambitious, but I believe that by simply being ambitious in our efforts to turn this area of freedom, security and justice into reality, we will persuade the citizens of the European Union to see our work as an effective instrument with which to confront their problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With a common general system of values it can create for itself the thing that people first look at when they meet, a face. It is therefore more than disappointing that this new face for Europe should have no binding nature for, at the present stage of development, the Charter will not form part of the Treaties. The modest will say, “well, at least we are creating a model”. However, we in the European Parliament should not be modest and we should maintain that a Charter opens up the opportunity of forming part of the Treaties, of becoming part of an all-European constitution and even possibly becoming the forerunner to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the question of who is to formulate the Charter is of outstanding significance. We well know that institutions have their own intricacy and each their own political motivation. There is then an obvious difference, whether an executive body or the administration work on the fundamental rights, or whether a Parliament does this. Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs demands, therefore, that the European Parliament should not collaborate as a mere accessory in such an important process, but as a generator of ideas and decision-maker on the same level as the Council. It is an important sign that this is precisely how so many national governments have come to see it recently.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are aware of the gap in credibility we have with the citizens of Europe which we still have to eliminate, for there would be the opportunity of also consulting, in a quite original form, non-governmental organisations and individual citizens in the process of development of the Charter. From this, we could envisage organising public hearings together, even in non-conventional meetings with citizens from the various national states. In this way, work on the face of fundamental rights could give new strength to the whole body of Europe. Freedom and equality, human dignity and social justice cannot be achieved until they are perceived as an issue of the peoples. I am therefore of the opinion that if we cannot have a Charter with the full participation of Parliament we should rather have none at all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council now has the opportunity, at the Tampere Summit, to achieve something like a Coal and Steel Community of freedom, security and justice within this European Union. My only fear is that this may not be the case, and my scepticism is based on a number of points. Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Madam President, I am of the view, that it is in fact necessary, for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work together on this on an equal footing, in the manner in which such a Charter of Fundamental Rights should be created. The principal role here must be that of the European Parliament. I find it unacceptable for us to have to act, so to speak, as mere decoration for the national parliaments. In internal committee we were very critical of the composition of this planned body, and we were told by the Presidency of the Council that it was not possible to deviate from the mandate. I find that scandalous! The Council grants itself a mandate and then declares that it cannot deviate from this mandate! I consider that to be absolutist in the extreme. I am therefore of the opinion that we should use today to bring this procedure back to Parliament. The citizens of Europe are represented by the European Parliament. If national parliaments co-operate, so much the better. But I would ask you, please, as the Council, to seek dialogue on this matter with the European Parliament on both the content and the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Tampere will also discuss the question of burden-sharing for civil war refugees and applicants for political asylum. I consider it scandalous that we have not yet decided to introduce set quotas. The Kosovo crisis has shown that, unfortunately, burden-sharing on a voluntary basis does not work. People have maintained that it was used in Kosovo and that it worked there. We were only lucky that thanks to the Nato intervention and thanks to the return of the Kosovo Albanians prepared to rebuild their lives, the flow of refugees was soon brought to a halt again. But we must see quite clearly that in the next crisis we would slip into a catastrophe if we approached that crisis with the same set of procedural instruments as in the Kosovo affair. We therefore need set burden-sharing according to quotas. European solidarity required clear, set rules which must be determined before the crisis arises and not in a mad rush once it is already underway. I would therefore like to say quite clearly, please use this opportunity to make Tampere a real new departure which will bring Europe real political integration beginning with internal security and co-operation in justice, because these are the core elements of statehood and also of the Community.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel though, after the speech that we have heard here this morning, that it may be because that item in the Treaty of Amsterdam which was, of necessity, destined to be almost a dead letter or just hot air, is now gaining a certain visibility, creating greater consensus and asserting itself naturally, thereby making the path towards a common area of freedom, security and justice seem much more credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in your speech today, Madam President of the Council, and two weeks ago, during the hearings of Commissioner Vitorino, we MEPs, used to the waffle of the Council and the Commission, found some philosophically rigorous elements concerning the fundamental assumptions about this real internal market of freedom and justice; that is, the market of values, no longer the market of goods and services – which have caused us to be quietly optimistic about Tampere and its consequences. Why should this be?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, because the basis for legal measures which we can implement is found within the framework of a Charter of Freedom and Fundamental rights. This is also because the Community method is favoured over traditional intergovernmental co-operation which will bring about a new European institutional or legal system, which, in turn, will be more efficient, modern, and closer to the problems still festering today. These are still unsolved and caught up in the web of sovereignty and of obsession with laws and nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, why not make the visibility of this new European area the benchmark of citizens’ trust, not by reducing the problem to the age-old argument of “freedom versus security”, but instead by taking on the whole range of new challenges and concerns for which European citizens hope Europe will actually find solutions?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although much has been done relating to the economic aspects of the Union and the strengthening of its political dimension, there remains a great deal to be done in the area of genuine freedom of movement for our citizens. Not only because the Treaty of Amsterdam enshrined the right to security, but also because the concept of European citizenship will not become real without a genuine area of freedom, security and justice. What is required is the abolition of internal borders, care for citizens’ security, harmonisation in terms of allowing into the European Union nationals of third countries, and allowing them freedom of movement once inside the Union, thereby creating an immigration and asylum policy which will be more coherent and unified. We also need to co-ordinate action on the prevention of crime and in the fight against it, particularly against organised crime (especially terrorism, trade in human beings, crimes against children, drug and weapons smuggling, corruption and fraud) and finally, we need laws and fundamental freedoms to be guaranteed at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why this Parliament, with the new responsibilities conferred on it by the Treaty of Amsterdam, must make its objective to move towards implementing this area of freedom, security and justice whilst respecting national differences and always attempting to bring Europe closer to its citizens, clear in the objectives it is trying to achieve and in the way they are conveyed to the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all of this, for the sake of Europe, for the sake of our fellow citizens and for the sake of the strengthening of freedoms, of security and justice, we must work together in a spirit of efficiency and interinstitutional solidarity. We in the European Parliament have the will to do this, we expect a great deal from the work of Commissioner Antonio Vitorino on the Commission, and from the Council. We expect to see signs of this and decisions on these matters by the time of the Tampere Council meeting.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many are looking towards Tampere with great hopes and are expecting considerable steps towards a Europe for the citizens. Here, I believe that the Charter of Citizens’ Rights is a unique opportunity to say to people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean that this Europe is not only a single market. It is not only a single currency. Rather, this Europe is a community of values designed to defend and promote the achievements in terms of civilisation which we in Europe have fought for over recent centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Citizens’ Rights can only be of interest if the method behind its preparation is open and transparent. This should not therefore entail a traditional Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors. This Charter must be drawn up openly in dialogue with the citizens. I believe that citizens’ rights is an original theme for the European Parliament and national parliaments alike. In this regard, I am of the opinion that the Tampere Summit should make considerable strides forward and allow the European Parliament a greater involvement than was agreed in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly a question of European citizens’ rights. In this respect, we should really ensure parity between representatives of this European Parliament and representatives at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that citizens will only take an interest in this Charter if it amounts to more than a solemn proclamation. Citizens’ rights must also be binding in law. I hope that this debate points the way ahead as to how these rights can be incorporated in the next treaties. Open debate and legal incorporation; then we will have the opportunity to get to know Europe’s citizens once again.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the previous legislature, this Parliament said “yes” to Monetary Union, “yes”<span class="italic"> </span>to social integration, making employment the centrepiece and the motor of European social policy, and now we must also say “yes”<span class="italic"> </span>to a European area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council of Tampere, which is the result of the initiative – it must be said – and the efforts of the President of the Spanish Government, José María Aznar, must confront this issue with the same political will that it displayed at the Extraordinary Summit in Luxembourg when it confronted the serious problem of unemployment. The phenomenon of migration is a challenge which we must face with courage, realism and a deep sense of humanity and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity and integration must be the two fundamental cornerstones of our immigration policy. As has been said here, any solutions which are legal, economic, social or based on controlling the flow of migration, should be adopted according to a common approach, in accordance with a common policy. This is not a Spanish, German or Italian problem, but rather a European Union problem. To this end, the very concept of immigration should be defined at the next European Council meeting in Tampere. Immigration for political reasons is one thing and economic immigration is another, and the two things do not require the same solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should define the concept of asylum which is very often confused with illegal immigration and the problems relating to the status of foreigners.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also establish, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam itself, a balanced effort amongst all the Member States to confront the consequences of accepting refugees, displaced persons and the powerful migratory pressure which is of an exclusively economic nature, such as that which originates from non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or the Southern flank of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it is important that we analyse the political, geographical and economic circumstances of each crisis and each type of immigration. It would be neither reasonable nor efficient to distribute responsibilities in a uniform way, especially with regard to the distribution of displaced people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, social integration will be the shield, or protection, in the face of the racist or xenophobic attitudes which are currently appearing in some European countries</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Madam President, by appealing to the countries from which the migratory flow originates. It is not enough for the European Union…</p>

I personally succeeded him in February 1997 in the European Parliament when he assumed his services as Deputy Foreign Minister. Madam President, please forgive me for intervening in this way and for being so overcome by emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Halonen, I found your speech, which included specific recommendations, particularly satisfying, since it strengthens my conviction that Tampere may prove to be a key event, a landmark on the way towards European integration. We hope that, like the European Parliament, the Council will send a clear signal to the citizens of Europe, reassuring them that the European Union is indeed interested in and seeks to promote their vital interests, such as heightened internal security, freedom of movement, free access to justice, the fight against international organised crime, cross-border controls and respect for fundamental freedoms and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Council meeting can and must take advantage of possibilities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam. It must make substantial progress on vital issues such as, firstly, the harmonisation of immigration and asylum policy, with a view both to securing better protection for immigrants and granting them rights; secondly, the issue of equitable burden sharing amongst Member States in hosting displaced persons, particularly from crisis areas, a very recent example being the Balkans; and thirdly, the issue of reinforcing internal security for EU citizens not only by police measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the time has come to adopt the relevant proposals put forward by Greece, which include the introduction of speedy access to justice for citizens, using alternative means such as arbitration and pre-trial conciliation, and also by creating a harmonised system of public order and a way of resolving differences, based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Tampere Summit will attempt to respond to this important challenge: the creation of a more secure Europe. One of the most important questions at the meeting will be the EU common immigration policy. The idea of a common policy on asylum and supranational burden sharing sounds fine, but it will be very difficult to put into practice. Instead, voluntary burden sharing would serve very well as a basis for Union action. If the desired results are not achieved with voluntary burden sharing, we might consider compensating Member States for costs incurred in respect of refugees flooding into the countries in question. This is something that you also proposed, Mrs Halonen. Otherwise, the use of measures for economic guidance should be approved as part of the policy on refugees practised by the Member States of the Union. For example, in my country, Finland, which is a very long way from places recent crises have focussed on, there is very broad support for the idea of effective aid for destitute people as close as possible to their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, there have been suggestions that responsibility for co-operation in police and legal matters should be transferred from the Third Pillar to the Community. This would, I imagine, make co-operation easier. The proposal, however, will very clearly interfere with the essential authority of nation-states, the right to determine the maintenance of the judicial system, and monitor compliance with the law in their areas. For that reason, we should consider at greater length the good and bad aspects of the proposal. Co-operation under the Third Pillar must be made adequate as long as the EU lacks its own police forces, and co-operation is always therefore based on action by the police forces of the Member States, which a Europol system would attempt to aid. Furthermore, as for the investigatory teams that were suggested, the situation is the same. The question of transferring responsibility to a common authority will become of serious interest only if we want to establish supranational police squads for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a European judicial area and establishing a working party to discuss the idea has my full support. The right of our citizens to fair treatment – access to justice – must be ensured and the public must be guaranteed adequate aid if they have to confront the legal authorities of a foreign Member State. I warmly support the idea to set up a working party to discuss the issue. The creation of a European judicial area has to be part of the new people’s Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure that the institutions will be capable in the end of finding their way out of the labyrinth, more or less willingly.

<p class="contents">This Charter must be binding and actionable. It must reinforce the rights of the citizens and, at the end of the day, of European citizenship. It must encompass all those who live and work in the Union. It must be connected therefore with the Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Treaty of Amsterdam may be revised. This Charter must benefit from the active participation of the European Parliament, involving a sufficient number of its Members so that all the political tendencies of the Union may be represented. And above all, the Charter must be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The term “proclamation”, which was used in Cologne, is clearly insufficient. From here on – I repeat – we must ensure that the Council finds it way out of its labyrinth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wish, as the New Democracy Party and Greek Opposition Party, to express our profound and sincere condolences and our deep sorrow at the death of a former colleague and, I must say, a very good politician in his capacity as Foreign Minister. </p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Council is extremely important, Madam President. We largely agree with the President-in-Office of the Council. However, she failed to show any clear political will, for example, in the area of harmonisation. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, of course, immigration policy is an integral part of external policy, but on many occasions external policy gives way on grounds of expediency, grounds which ultimately go against the humanitarian aspect related to immigration and asylum policy. Of course, Europe cannot close its doors, but neither should it open them so wide as to create ghettos or open them without having laid down the necessary preconditions beforehand. These policies will have to tie in with development and co-operation policies which, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, have been largely unsuccessful in the delivery of the financial aid they promised.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem, however, is that “dark side” – the amalgamation of organised crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, and other activities. We are reaching the point where we are simply observing from a distance the activities of these people, especially those involved in organised crime, and cannot confront them. Justice and security are absolutely essential, Madam President, and harmonisation is absolutely essential, but to make all that happen, the necessary political will is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Halonen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI) </span>Madam President, given the time available, it will unfortunately be impossible to answer in sufficient detail all those questions that have been asked here, but we have made a note of them and in subsequent discussions and preparatory work, I shall try with all the means at my disposal to take account of the ideas expressed in them and provide you with additional information in a suitable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The question raised by several speakers on the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is, obviously, in an indirect sense, the idea behind the meeting at Tampere, as we are preparing to take a new step forward to ensure for our citizens a safer EU area than before, although the drafting of the Charter is not actually the theme of the debate at Tampere. For that a special body will be set up, a body which representatives of the European Parliament will be welcome to join.</p>
<p class="contents">As for European representation at Tampere, you may know that Mrs Fontaine, now presiding, will be present at the start of the meeting. In addition, we are aware of your resolution and the discussions we have had here will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I will move on to the questions that have actually been raised in this sitting, which I have chosen from a group of many. First, I will deal with Mr Pirker’s question regarding immigration strategy. It will be an important basis for the talks at Tampere, but there is not yet consensus in the Council on it. For that reason, it will indeed be discussed at Tampere, but we have no document prepared on the subject. As for the Eurodac Regulation, we are attempting to have it approved now during the Finnish presidential term, and you may know that we are awaiting a new report by the European Parliament on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Mr Watson’s question regarding respect for the institution of asylum and co-operation with the UNHCR, we are in full agreement on the matter. It was on this very issue that I based my own speech. I agree with you that Europe should not shut others out, but that it must be porous in its relations with the outside world. We are members of the UN, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and, for precisely these reasons, we are also able to create natural relations with the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Wuori’s question, I would only like to say briefly that the country holding the Presidency respects the principle of transparency, and although he has never been a Member of Parliament in Finland, he will surely know that in Finland, as in the other Member States, the national parliament enjoys a certain autonomy, which a government representative will not interfere with in matters such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of his group, Mr Seppänen raised the issue of Europol surveillance. Finland believes that the present system of monitoring will suffice for the time being, but in the future the surveillance systems must be completely improved. I also accept his remarks on electronic systems, and I promise to investigate the matter further.</p>
<p class="contents">To the question asked by Mr Schulz and others on the issue of the legal area and fundamental rights, I would like to state that I stressed that we must build an area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of common values, with respect for human rights and, in the same way, reinforcing the issue of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would still like to raise one particular point. I am very satisfied that in many speeches people mentioned that we do not want to make the European Union into a fortress, but want to make it an area of safety that is in natural harmony with its environment. For my own part, I would like to remind everyone that the European Union is not the same as Europe, and the world outside the European Union is not just one of poverty, hunger and despair. Obviously there are problems there, but there are also countries which have a high standard of development and which are willing to work in co-operation with us. As examples of these I would like to mention Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. I also wish to remind you that we also have duties as members of the United Nations, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe. The principle of democracy is that people are not just objects of the state. They are also subjects of the state, and we must remember that when we create relationships with others to work in co-operation with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor within the European Union do we always really need new directives. Very often it is a question of our compliance with decisions that have already been made. It is also a question of our ratification and practical implementation of UN and Council of Europe agreements in force and seeing that Member States actually comply accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It may be that, because of this air crash in Greece, I was rather more sensitive, more sensitive than usual, to your rebukes regarding a lack of co-operation, but I would like to assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we must also be confident among ourselves in the European Union that national democracy is doing the job of complementing right here among you a growing democracy for the European Union itself. They are together forming – I am sure of it and many speakers said they were too – a truly successful combination that will enable us in the future to both create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and take the Tampere meeting and the principles that lie at the heart of it forward, so that they do not remain mere official statements and that we also make progress in practical matters. I hope that in the future I may gain your confidence in this matter as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
