I would also like to state my concern at the very low level of commitment of Cohesion Fund appropriations at the end of August – only 16%, Mrs Torres Marques – and, while things have changed for the better since the end of August, I would like to reiterate this concern, which I shared with Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Meetings have been held with the Greek, Irish and Portuguese authorities to ask the governments of these countries to speed up their presentation to the Commission of their Cohesion Fund projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received a set of projects from Spain which give me cause to hope that, in the case of this country, there will be a complete implementation of appropriations for the year in progress, subject, of course, to these projects fulfilling the requirements in terms of technical expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Portugal, Mrs Torres Marques, but above all in the case of Greece, the number of projects received does not give me the same cause to hope for a satisfactory implementation of appropriations. Please understand me when I say that I would not wish to be misunderstood in the slightest by you or any of the MEPs concerned. I do not want to point the finger or hand out good or bad marks. It is my responsibility to manage as rigorously and as actively as possible the European Union’s second largest budget, that for Regional Policy and the Cohesion Fund. I have to report not only to the Court of Auditors and to the tax-payers, but also, first and foremost, to the European Parliament, which is responsible for budgetary control and for adopting this budget, and I believe that it is my duty and role to say what is happening, at such times as I judge fit, and to do so in a transparent manner, with respect for the budgetary authority of which the European Parliament forms part.</p>
<p class="contents">There are reasons why so few projects have been submitted to the Commission to date. On the one hand, as a result of the efforts made to commit all the appropriations at the end of 1999, there was inevitably a very sharp drop in applications for the financing of new projects at the beginning of this financial year. On the other hand, as this is the first year of the new programming period, I have to say, and this is an objective assessment, that the Cohesion Fund countries, including your own, have centred their efforts on Objective 1 programming. I have, in fact, publicly stated, notably at Lisbon in the presence of the Prime Minister and Mrs Lisa Ferreira, that the Commission was extremely satisfied with the quality of the work carried out by the Portuguese authorities in conjunction with the local authorities as concerns Objective 1 programming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, due to the very major efforts made it has been impossible to make a simultaneous and commensurate effort in respect of the Cohesion Fund. I would like to say to the countries concerned that they now have to make this effort and swiftly present a sufficient number of tangible projects. Otherwise, there will be a risk of certain Cohesion Fund appropriations made for the financial year 2000 being lost for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, contrary to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on the Structural Funds, no form of rebudgeting in subsequent financial years is provided for in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Those countries that are Cohesion Fund beneficiaries should therefore be under no illusion that there is little time left for projects to be submitted and appraised under the budget year in progress. That is the point that I wanted to make as clearly as possible, Mrs Torres Marques. Thank you for providing me with the possibility to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I think, Mr Barnier – and I am sorry to say this – you are not very well informed. Perhaps the lack of staff you have just mentioned exclusively devoted to the Cohesion Fund – who did exist in the former Commission – prevented you from having more concrete details. According to the details I have, and after what you said in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Planning, I know that Portugal has already submitted projects that exceed the Cohesion Fund in both the transport section and the environment section.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that this fund has always been very well managed by the four countries and has always had 100% take-up rates. You must be very concerned to know why countries that have always complied so well seem not to be complying now. I think the ball is in your court: your staff have the details, but they must be allowed to provide an answer. What I am afraid of, Mr Barnier, is that the Commission may be taking the opportunity to cut the Cohesion Fund appropriations in the 2001 budget.

The previous programming period finished at the end of 1999. We are now in a new programming period, and it is this period that I basically have to worry about in terms of my accountability, which does not prevent me from being highly attentive, in conjunction with Mrs Schreyer, and under the control of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the balancing of accounts for previous programmes. Now, I also have some concerns in this area, some of which concern Objective 2, Objective 1 and Cohesion Fund appropriations that date some way back.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, reiterate that Portugal did indeed handle matters well in the previous period. I am simply observing, and I have given you the figures as at 26 September, that the appropriations actually committed by Portugal, for the new period – I have only been a member of the Commission for a year – stand at 2.6%. You have heard me: 2.6%.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite familiar with the General Regulation on the Structural Fund and on the Cohesion Fund, and I am aware that they are not governed by the same rules. I would thus issue a warning: Watch out! It will not be possible to re-programme or rebudget for subsequent years, and there is a risk of losing a number of Cohesion Fund appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have written to Mrs Ferreira, with whom I have had very good and constructive relations, to state my concerns. I know that your country is making great efforts to present a sufficient number of projects. We will validate the technical content of these projects as swiftly as possible so that your country, like the other Cohesion Fund countries, is not made to suffer and is able to benefit from all the appropriations in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I provided all this information to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September, but, if you really wanted, I could arrange for this information to be transmitted to you this evening or tomorrow, in the form that it was submitted, in all transparency, to the competent Committee on 11 September, under a month ago, for all the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no major worries, regarding Objective 1 funding, for any of the countries concerned, nor any major worries regarding Objective 2 funding: things are moving forward and, by and large, discussions on the Single Programming Documents are already under way. I believe that negotiations are in progress on 83 of the 102 SPDs to be signed, although I am only speaking from memory.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I laying the emphasis on the Cohesion Fund? Because, once again, the General Regulation treats the Structural Funds (Objectives 1 and 2) and the Cohesion Fund differently, and because, if I were forced to, I could not enter into reprogramming in the case of the Cohesion Fund. There would therefore be a risk of losing the money. That is why I am sounding the alarm without, I repeat, pointing the finger at any particular countries, because planning everything in one year for the seven years to come makes major demands on regional and national administrations, national governments and Commission officials.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 2 by Neil MacCormick (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0730_EN.html">H-0730/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Fuel duty</span></p>
<p class="contents">The current level of fuel duty in the United Kingdom is very substantially in excess of that prevailing in any other Member State. The burden imposed by this tax is especially heavy on remoter parts of the country, in particular the Scottish Borders and the Scottish Highlands and Islands. This has a severely distorting effect on competition as between small and medium-sized undertakings in these localities and multinational or other large-scale undertakings operating throughout the United Kingdom, as between tourist industries in these localities and hotel chains concentrated in large centres nearer to mainland Europe, such as London, and as between farmers and fishermen in remote parts and farmers and fishermen more advantageously located.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission therefore carry out an inquiry into the question whether the excessive level of fuel duty in the United Kingdom constitutes a breach of competition law under the Treaties and is therefore illegal. What action does the Commission intend to take on this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1987, the Commission submitted several proposals on indirect taxation in order to abolish the fiscal borders as part of completing the internal market. Regarding duty, the aim of the Commission was to achieve complete harmonisation of taxation on mineral oils within the Community by introducing a unique duty for each type of product. Had these measures met with approval, unfair competition, as intimated by the honourable member today, would almost certainly have been ruled out. However, this proposal instead met with heavy protest from certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1989, the Commission submitted a new proposal which was to offer more flexibility. That proposal which, in addition to minimum rates, also provided for narrow rate bands and target rates, was once again rejected by the Member States. Eventually, in 1992, the Member States unanimously decided on the introduction of a Community system of tax levies on mineral oils which only provided for a minimum tax rate for each type of mineral oil on the basis of its use; i.e. as fuel for motor vehicles, for industrial and commercial use or for heating. I would thus like to underline that the Community minimum rates have not been reviewed since 1992 and that today, in practice, duty levels often far exceed the Community minimum rates and also differ greatly from country to country. As the honourable Member pointed out, the duty on fuel and diesel used as motor fuel which applies in the United Kingdom is the highest in Europe, but duties on fuel oil and kerosene, at least if – and insofar as – these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or even for heating, remain far below the highest values applicable within the Union, as is also the case with the duty on heavy fuel oil. It is thus a mixed bag and it is not the case that all duties on mineral oils are higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if duties on mineral oils are laid down at a high level, this does not lead to non-compliance with Community regulations in terms of competition. Government aid, on the other hand, could exist, as a form of government aid, only if certain specific sectors were to enjoy exemptions from general regulations, and the compatibility or otherwise of such aid measures with the Treaty would then have to be examined. This concludes my response for the time being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To make matters clear, as the Commission will know, this question was tabled before the protests began and it was prompted by complaints from people in my constituency. For example, there is a company on the island of North Uist which is engaged in quarrying and road maintenance. It seems a very good idea that there should be small- and medium-sized enterprises that are able to tender for and compete for road maintenance work on islands of that kind. It is good for employment and for social cohesion. If the fuel costs of a company like that are more than double those of multinational companies with other bases elsewhere in Scotland which can bid for the same contracts, obviously this severely distorts competition, to the disadvantage of outlying communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the points Mr Bolkestein made and I know that the principal rule in the treaties prohibits charging foreigners more than home companies, but the general law of fair competition in Europe ought to apply and where levels of taxation are totally disproportionate we should look at the effect competition law can have on the situation, despite the general rule that these matters are the prerogative of Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to be clear and insist on this point, because, as I said in my answer in the first instance, the Commission has made several attempts to get Member States to agree to the harmonisation of excise taxes precisely to avoid distortions in trade which may arise as a result of the differences therein. Mr MacCormick will realise that these attempts by the Commission have been rejected by the Council. Therefore once again, the Commission has no instruments to get Member States to change the level of excise taxes. That is the first point that I would like to repeat and insist upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, where Member States favour by fiscal means a certain sector of industry, they thereby infringe the rules on state aid, in this case fiscal state aid which is akin to a subsidy. Mr MacCormick rightly strives for equality of treatment and equal and fair competition. If a particular sector or region is favoured through fiscal means then the laws of fair and equal competition are infringed and the Commission, in the form of my colleague Mr Monti, will take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr MacCormick will know that there are a certain number of derogations from the principle of certain and definite levels of excise taxes. These derogations stem from Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81 of the European Union and are approximately 100 in number. These derogations are called the 8(4) derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Commission is looking at all these derogations and examining whether they should be prolonged and if so, for what length of time. In the course of this examination, the Commission will also answer the question of whether such derogations are an infringement of the Treaty rules on state aid, because obviously a derogation may border upon fiscal state aid and if there is an overlap, there may be a case for the Commission to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the case in point, which had not yet come to my attention, I assume that the conditions under which large and small companies operate are connected with the excise taxes for the minerals oils that they use and as long as the excise taxes are similar or more or lessthe same for these various sectors of industry, there is not much scope for the Commission to intervene. I hope that I am clear in this. If I have not persuaded Mr MacCormick, I hope that I can do so perhaps after this meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Excise duty is absolutely identical in all parts of the United Kingdom. I should like to ask this: is the Commission aware of a recent highly reputable Swedish academic study which has demonstrated that taking all costs into account, transport costs in the UK are in fact average compared with the European Union as a whole? Taking account of non-wage labour costs, the cost of licensing and insuring vehicles and road tolls, the UK is no more expensive to drive in than any other part of the European Union. Given the Community's commitment to meeting its Kyoto commitments, I wonder whether the Commissioner would accept that the best way of doing so is by higher fuel duties, as opposed to raising the other transport costs. If you want to conserve fuel, the way to do it is through fuel duty, not other forms of taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the price elasticity of demand. It is a mechanism which I suppose is familiar to Mr Martin. Although the precise shape of the elasticity curve is something we may debate, the fact that it exists is certain if one looks at the oil-intensity of the economy and how that intensity has changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the oil crisis in the 70s is has approximately halved. There can be no doubt that in the longer term intensity plays an extremely important role. If, therefore, Mr Martin bears in mind that if we want to attain the aims and purposes of the Kyoto Agreement and a high price of oil to the consumer would be beneficial to that end, then he has the logic of economic reasoning behind him. The logic of economic reasoning supports the statement made by Mr Martin. One may, of course, expand on his wish – which I deduce from his words – to comply with the undertakings which we entered into in Kyoto, by saying that other forms of energy may also help us attain that aim. For example, nuclear energy is a very clear case in point. It is not part of my portfolio to deal with energy, and particularly not with nuclear energy, but since Mr Martin has embarked upon an economic line of reasoning then I feel free to make this remark.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other sides to this picture. If one increases the price of oil, one influences economic growth in an adverse manner. In both the Western world and for developing countries calculations have been made which show that an increase in the price of oil – USD 5 per barrel or USD 10 per barrel – means that economic growth will suffer by 0.2% or 0.5% or whatever. So it is not a simple picture. Kyoto is important. We all want to achieve that. The high price of oil is conducive to achieving that end but there is also a negative factor on economic growth with its attendant consequences in the form of more unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a simple picture. I would caution Members – insofar as that may be necessary – against a one-sided approach to this whole problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The budget line of the European Union for minority languages was introduced in 1983 and increased steadily to reach a peak in 1995 with EUR 4 million. Since then the appropriations have been cut, for no apparent reason, with the result that in the current year they amount to EUR 3.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more surprising in that the European Union is moving closer towards enlargement to the East and the question of minorities is becoming increasingly important as a result, particularly in the context of a proper exchange of information.

The Commission has not entered in the budget any specific appropriations for the financing of projects directly intended to promote regional or minority languages, for reasons that I will now attempt to explain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure specifies that appropriations relating to activities with no legal basis – as with the case in point – for projects concerning the promotion and safeguarding of regional and minority languages and cultures, may be entered in the budget for only three financial years at the most, and on condition that the establishment of a legal basis for them is subsequently envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind this limitation, and in view of the scope for financing projects concerning minority languages as part of the European Year of Languages 2001, the decision was taken not to enter specific appropriations in the budget for 2001 but to consider the possibility of providing a more sustained form of support to the future of these languages, and this within the framework defined by the 1999 agreement. In other words, I am relying very much on the European Year of Languages to set things in motion and to enable us, at the end of that year, to come together and arrive at a lasting solution that does not oblige us to return to the lists each year and do battle to obtain funding.</p>
<p class="contents">It should nevertheless be noted that regional and minority languages and cultures are eligible for support under a number of other programmed actions. For example, preparatory activities designed to encourage the use of digital content on worldwide networks in order to promote linguistic diversity in the information society – Culture 2000, MEDIA – insofar as the projects proposed contribute to the achievement of the objectives of these actions. While no amount is specifically set aside for minority languages as part of these activities, this does not prevent these programmes being used for that purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, the Braunmüller Verlag published a book by Dr. Christoph Pan entitled “Volksgruppen in Europa – Ein Handbuch” [Nations in Europe – a Handbook], which listed some 60 minority groups in the European Union, 300 in the continent of Europe. Out of a total of 750 million inhabitants, 100 million belong to minority groups.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Campaign against child sex tourism</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since 1998 ECPAT Sweden has been running a project for a code of conduct for tour operators against child sex tourism with a view to persuading tour operators to undertake to eliminate demand for this type of tourism. As the project also covers Germany and Austria, it has been receiving 60% EU funding since November 1999. A new decision by the Commission is required to continue financial support after November. No new application procedure for assistance has yet been initiated. There is therefore concern that funding may cease. As I assume that action against child sex trafficking is one of the Commission’s priorities, will a new application procedure be initiated to carry on funding the ECPAT project? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission agrees on the importance of the fight against child sex tourism. The Commission will pursue its actions to protect human dignity by preventing and combating violence against children, including child sex tourism, in the field of cooperation in justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Last spring and summer the European Commission carried out a general review of its activities and human resources. On 26 July 2000 the Commission concluded that it needed more than 1 200 extra posts to be able to manage all its tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past the Commission's executive tasks have increased while its political and legislative work has decreased in relative terms. In July the Commission decided to reverse this trend and reduce its executive tasks in order to have sufficient human resources for the political, legislative and conceptual tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">For a wide range of sectors this means the reduction and phasing out of activities. In particular activities financed by small budget lines will be reduced because they are very intensive in terms of human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The sex tourism information and awareness campaigns have had an important role to play. However, in view of the lack of resources and in line with the general trend of cutting small budget lines, these activities will be phased out. Thus the Commission will not make new financing commitments next year. Nevertheless the Commission will do its best to use appropriations for these activities in this year's budget. I have instructed my services to find the most efficient solution in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Discontinuing support for the information campaign does not, however, mean that the Commission will abandon its other activities to protect children against violence and abuse, notably the STOP programme. The Commission is preparing a proposal to renew the programme later this year and child sex tourism will be one of its concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also preparing legislative proposals on the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. Proposals will seek to approximate definitions, offences and penalties and the extra-territorial application of Member States' criminal laws on sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field Member States have a major responsibility. Nevertheless the Commission will, in close collaboration with the Member States, continue to play an active role in developing and maintaining a coherent European policy to protect children against violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second thing I want to ask about is whether you believe that the matter has been handled in an acceptable way.</p>

As I said, I have asked my officials to find a solution which would enable us to use the current budget grant, that is to say the money we budgeted for the year 2000.

It would be devastating if support for the work on combating child sex tourism were to be withdrawn. That cannot reasonably be the EU’s policy. Every year, more than one million children are forced into prostitution. These children are increasingly exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe. The fact that the major paedophile scandal in Belgium is now no longer making the headlines in the media does not, of course, mean that the child sex trade has disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for ECPAT is incredibly important. It is completely in line with the Council’s 1999 decision concerning efforts to combat child sex tourism and with the resolution adopted by Parliament as late as March of this year. To withdraw support for this work would therefore be to go both against the Council’s and Parliament’s demand for priority to be given to the fight against the child sex trade. How the Commission is to solve the problem <span class="italic">technically</span> is, I think, a matter still to be resolved, but the main thing is that this important work should continue to receive support from the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can the Commission say whether it has carried out any investigation into the cost of adapting European undertakings to the Euro, what the outcome of that investigation is likely to be and what will be the average cost to each European firm, in particular small firms, of adapting to the changes required by exclusive use of the single currency as from 1 January 2002? Will provision be made for any Community financial contribution for European Union undertakings (especially those in the weakest position) in order to lessen the burden posed by the forthcoming changes? Some experts in the field believe that there is a risk that it will prove impossible for undertakings to adapt their computer systems and software in time. This would jeopardise their operation, and might force them to return to conducting all their business on paper. Does the Commission share this view, and what action will it take to prevent such problems? </p>

These include Directive 92/45 of 16 June 1992 on public and animal health problems relating to the killing of wild game and the placing on the market of wild-game meat which already lays down a number of hygiene rules with respect to wild game.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new proposal, the existing food hygiene rules have been simplified. They are presented in a clearer way and unnecessary detail has been deleted. The proposed rules are definitely less extensive than the existing rules. Within the proposal on food hygiene the rules on meat from hunted animals are a minor but important part. It must first be emphasised that the proposal on the hunting of wild game does not apply to reindeer nor is it the intention that it should cover meat that is destined for the hunters' own private consumption. The proposal gives more responsibility to the hunter for judging the fitness for human consumption of wild game meat that is directly delivered to the consumer. The proposal aims to ensure that hunters are able to make a judgment about the safety of such wild-game meat. The Professional Hunters' Association would play an important role in ensuring that the hunters have the qualifications to make such a judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies also to moose. The impact of the proposal is limited. Already at present there is an obligation in Finland to present moose that is shot and sold to restaurants for inspection by the competent authority and some Member States already apply the rules as proposed. The proposal has been elaborated in close consultation with the Federation of Field Sports Associations of the European Union. It is believed that with the increased responsibilities for the hunters, consumer confidence in food safety are increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Live animal transports</span></p>
<p class="contents">A new Commission report on a mission that it carried out in France in November 1999 and a recent investigation in Italy by Compassion in World Farming and Animal Angels, show that several Member States are still not properly enforcing Council Directive 91/628/EEC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the Protection of Animals During Transport (as amended by 95/29/EC<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>). It emerged from this report that some transporters are failing to stop and give animals rest at the places which they have indicated on their route plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also notes serious breaches on vehicle standards and maximum journey limits regarding animals arriving into and travelling through France. Would the Commission indicate the Member State from which the animals and vehicles referred to in Section 5.4.2 of the report come, and the Member State from which the animals mentioned in Section 5.3.1 of the report come?

While Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation, the Food and Veterinary Office of my Directorate-General undertakes specific control and inspection missions to check that Member States apply Community legislation in an effective and uniform manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Community legislation, transporters of livestock must submit a route plan in advance to the competent authority of the place of departure when the journey exceeds eight hours. On their return, the transporters must send back completed route plans to the same competent authority. The competent authorities of the place of departure must check in particular that completed route plans have been returned and verify that the journeys have been carried out according to the plans.</p>
<p class="contents">During the mission referred to, carried out in France in November 1999, it was found that the route plans stamped by the competent authorities of the place of departure were not properly implemented and that travelling time limits were often exceeded. The FVO mission report mentioned refers specifically to transporters whose journeys originated in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning France, the Commission is waiting to be informed about the actions taken by the competent authorities regarding some of the recommendations of the FVO mission report, especially of the action taken to ensure that route plans are properly used and signed. A reminder has been recently sent to the French authorities. Irish authorities have been informed of the findings of the FVO and details of the deficiencies detected have been sent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently monitoring the situation in both cases. If it appears that a Member State repeatedly fails to enforce Community legislation, the Commission would consider opening an infringement procedure under Article 226, as has already been initiated against other Member States in relation to the protection of animals during transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I will present a report on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport to the Council and to the European Parliament. The Commission's report will include the findings mentioned in the FVO inspection reports. When this report has been concluded, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of insufficient enforcement of the travelling time limits will be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I assure you that animal welfare is very high on the Commission's agenda. I look forward to further discussion of these issues when I present the report on animal transport in the next few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this is not yet reflected in the relevant Community seeds legislation, this principle would apply also to those seed lots of conventional plant varieties of the different genera and species, including cotton, which contain impurities of EU-unapproved genetically modified seeds. Member States are responsible for inspection and control to ensure compliance with Directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission White Paper on food safety has foreseen the need to amend the annexes of the existing directives on the marketing of seeds in order to first of all lay down the growing conditions and other requirements for purity concerning the adventitious presence of genetically modified seeds in seed lots of traditional plant varieties and secondly to lay down the details of the labelling requirements for seed of genetically modified plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services are currently preparing a draft Commission directive covering these issues and including cotton seed. However, in this year's spring sowing season the Commission was informed of interceptions of imported seed of conventional varieties of different species including cotton containing traces of GM seed. The Member States concerned reacted differently with regard to the interceptions. As far as the measures taken by the Greek authorities are concerned, I would also refer to the answer given my colleague, Mrs Wallström, to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0742_EN.html">H-742/2000</a>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Standing Committee on seeds and propagating material for agriculture, horticulture and forestry has discussed a plan for coordinated and harmonised interim action in respect of GM seed impurities in seed of conventional varieties. Under this plan the Member States would immediately organise testing of a significant number of seed lots of conventional varieties to determine the presence of GM seeds until the coming into force of related new Community legislative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">A set of criteria was identified to establish a common approach for sampling and testing for the presence of GM seeds and for appropriate action in the case of detection of GM seeds. The criteria are currently under discussion. This interim action plan is designed to cover the period until the coming into force of related new legislation in order to avoid an unsatisfactory situation similar to that earlier this year in the forthcoming sowing seasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner has told us about some general measures that are going to be taken. But he did not mention a single substantive, practical measure to prevent the importation of GM seeds. How are we to interpret this? Of course, we may get an expression of wishes, as today, and of good intentions. But there continues to be a lack of any practical measures to prevent imports from the United States and from third countries of genetically propagating material infected by genetically modified organisms. I take the view, Commissioner, that you should ask, for example, that cargoes are accompanied by a supporting document, a certificate from a reliable, accredited international body or laboratory to testify that the imported seed lots are free from GMOs. But you are not asking for anything like this. This is a practical measure which you could introduce immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, having consulted with his services, I am in a position to inform you that essential safety requirements concerning computer equipment to be used privately or in the working place are prescribed by a directive relating to electrical products, the Low Voltage Directive, as well as by the Directive on Radio Equipment and Telecommunication Terminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific standards have been developed by standardisation bodies on a number of these safety aspects. There are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the Directive on the Safety in the Workplace but none yet for private use. Moreover, the Council recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the public to electro-magnetic fields is applicable to safety aspects of computer equipment. Concerning these aspects, the Commission has already prepared a mandate for the standardisation bodies to draft standards on the use of computers over long periods.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as advice to be given to parents and teachers, whose children and pupils use computers, is concerned, manufacturers are obliged, under the present legislation to provide an instruction for safe use of the equipment if deemed necessary. The general product safety also puts an obligation on producers to provide consumers with information on risks.</p>
<p class="contents">This autumn the Commission will ask CENELEC to consider the development of standards on the effect on eyes of display units and computer screens for private use, as well as the inclusion of information and warnings for parents and teachers on this aspect. Ergonomic aspects will also be assessed to find if action at Community level is needed. At this stage the Commission does not consider that a specific directive is required to cover the issue of warnings for parents identified by the honourable Member. Standardisation can meet the concerns expressed. This is the same approach which has been followed to address, for example, the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled in relation to information and communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">For the more general question on the follow-up by Member States to the Council resolution on operating instructions for technical consumer goods, it should be noted that this resolution is addressed to Member States and to the economic operators and does not involve any specific follow-up by the Commission. However, the Commission will ask the Member States to provide information on the follow-up given the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the honourable Member knows, Iran's penal code is based on Islamic sharia law. The death sentence is widely used. The Iranian authorities are well aware of our opposition to the death penalty. We have repeated that position on numerous occasions. In February 2000, the European Union asked Iran to introduced a moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of death penalties handed down against four student leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no reports as to whether the death sentence on Ms Ayubi has been carried out. According to European Union diplomats in Teheran, however, no death sentence by stoning has been carried out in Iran during the last three years. The Commission is very concerned at the poor human rights record in Iran in general. The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues. The recent parliamentary election in Iran will we hope offer an opportunity to develop a more productive dialogue on human rights with the Iranian government. In doing this we will regularly review the progress of reform in Iran including in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third committee of the 55th session of the UN General Assembly a resolution on Iran is being prepared and the presidency has informed Member States of meetings with the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Commission.

It seems incredible that today, in the year 2000, in a world which is globally interconnected, women are being sentenced to death for adultery. If Maryam did not live in a theocratic regime she would be free, she could enjoy the right to life, but as she lives in Iran, she will be stoned to death. The Spanish Prime Minister – Mr Aznar – is to make an official visit to that country in October. Perhaps he will shake hands with President Khatami. Commissioner, is it not inconsistent for us to form friendships and ties with regimes which violate human rights in this way, to the point of stoning its women to death?</p>

My own view is that we should continue to argue our position on human rights with considerable vigour. We should do that bilaterally with the Iranian government and, where appropriate, in international fora and we should certainly give every encouragement to those more moderate elements in countries like Iran who believe, as the honourable Member and I do, that human rights are universally valid and not some colonial implant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The record of the Burmese regime remains appalling. Like Members of this House and decent civilised people the world over, the Commission deplores the continued violation of human rights by the military regime in Burma, in particular the extra-judicial killings, the widespread imposition of forced labour and forced displacement of local populations, as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The regime's treatment of the Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, is all of a piece with their treatment of the Burmese people. The dignity and courage with which she responds is an inspiration to all of us and a symbol of hope to the people of Burma of a brighter future.</p>
<p class="contents">I join with the honourable Member in expressing my admiration of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow members of the NLD. Today Aung San Suu Kyi is now under de facto house arrest. Even when this is relaxed, as we hope it soon will be, she will be far from free as we are now wearily familiar with the array of wholly unjustified restrictions that the regime maintains on her freedom of movement. These restrictions apply sometimes in an even more draconian way to the National League for Democracy. The NLD is a legal political party but it is subject to continual harassment and its members are routinely subject to arbitrary arrests.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned by reports that party members, waiting with Aung San Suu Kyi at Rangoon station two weeks ago, were attacked and even chloroformed before being evicted from the station premises.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation must be based on agreement between the regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Aung San Suu Kyi has long pressed for such a dialogue. We continue to support fully the desire of the General Affairs Council to establish a meaningful political dialogue with Burma in order to express forthrightly the European Union's concerns and to press for change.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda for the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Vientiane in December is due to include an open discussion on the situation in Burma with our ASEAN partners. It offers an opportunity to express our concerns firmly, directly and in detail to the representative of the SPDC. The EU's attitude towards that ministerial meeting in Vientiane and indeed, whether it should take place at all, or at what level the EU should be represented at it, will depend on developments in Burma between now and December. We will be watching developments closely but we should also be clear that the December meeting is about the EU's political relations with ASEAN as a whole. We do not want to permit the generals in Rangoon to be allowed to hold that relationship hostage. We are determined not to let the behaviour of the regime in Rangoon prevent us from developing our relations with the other nine members of ASEAN. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a serious argument about whether one should go further. Speaking for myself, though I have always wanted to go to Burma and particularly to see Bagan, I would not dream of going to Burma in the present circumstances and I would advise other people similarly.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the overall question of trade and investment, I will be absolutely candid with the honourable Member about my assessment and about my concern. My assessment is that the main reason why there is not more investment in Burma is the policies pursued by the regime there. So long as a regime like that is behaving in that way, it would be extraordinary if anybody was to think that it made much sense to invest there.</p>
<p class="contents">My other problem, whenever I think about or talk about sanctions, is a concern about how smart sanctions ever are in practice. The living conditions of people in Burma, thanks to the appalling government under which they suffer, are bad enough as it is and I would not like to do anything that made those living conditions worse. So I am reluctant to go further on trade or to advise further action on trade or investment.</p>
<p class="contents">As for further declaratory political action, I am always prepared to consider the case for that. This is where the whole question of whether or not it is worth engaging in a dialogue is one that has to think about very carefully. For example, if we were to send a commission still to Rangoon we would only conceivably consider doing so if there was a guarantee that a delegation could meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, if there was a guarantee that it could meet with her party colleagues, if there was a guarantee that it could also meet with the ethnic minority leaders. In those circumstances it may well be that a mission would be justifiable. One has to discuss issues like this with the balance of advantage very much in mind as to whether or not it really is going to provide some discernible positive effect if one connects with people who pursue policies which most of the rest of the world regards as being appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point. I think it is very important that the ASEAN countries themselves put pressure on Burma. Burma is exporting instability to the rest of the region, it is exporting drugs, it is exporting HIV/Aids, and I hope the rest of the region will do what it can to change policies in Rangoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would have a considerable effect on the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">As for elections beyond those for the municipalities, we must take one step at a time and ensure that the elections for the municipal administration are properly conducted and involve the people of Kosovo more in managing their own affairs. One thing we can all be certain of is that the electoral process in Kosovo will be fair, unlike the electoral process in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">The OSCE is responsible within UNMIK for the election organisation and for the sort of issues which the honourable Member referred to. It is worth recalling that EU Member States, as OSCE members, pay about 67% of OSCE's budget. That does not count any other bilateral donations that they may be making to particular projects. We have provided from the Commission EUR 5 million for registration and identity card equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was in Kosovo the other day I was very struck by those who told me that the initial stages of the election campaign had been conducted with considerable professionalism and style. They referred to some of the election meetings, for example, that they had gone to. Maybe they do not yet have decorous televised debates with Jim Lehrer, with everybody avoiding being rude about one another, but they certainly have started their election campaign with a good deal of brio. I hope that will continue, that the election process will produce results in which everybody in Kosovo from every group will be able to feel that they are sharing in the administration of their local communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I happened to be there together with 200 other election observers from 52 countries. Regardless of the opinion one may have about the regime there, I have to say that the elections were beyond reproach. I can tell you that these elections were conducted democratically, and were better than elections in our own countries, which I have happened to take part in or observe on many occasions. The issue, Commissioner, is not whether Mr Milosevic will accept the outcome of the elections. The question is whether the leader of the opposition, Mr Kostunica, will accept the results, and whether he will go to a second round next Sunday in order to complete the elections and to give the people of Serbia, the Yugoslavian people, the opportunity to decide on their future, without interference from you and without interference inside Serbia. As regards Kosovo, it would have been better had it taken part in these elections, which were simultaneously presidential, parliamentary, regional and municipal elections. This is how the European Union could help to remedy the situation, and also by putting an end to the genocidal sanctions which are still in place today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even fewer people in Serbia would recognise the description of the electoral process which has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Serbia – including, I suspect, Mr Milosevic – know perfectly well who won the elections on the first round, which accounts for the fact that Mr Kostunica not unreasonably has argued that the election process should now be recognised and he should enter into the responsibilities for which the people of Serbia have clearly elected him. The sooner that happens and the sooner Serbia can rejoin the European family the better, as far as I am concerned. Whether, when that happens the honourable Member will be looking back nostalgically to the days of Mr Milosevic, we will see. Most of us believe that Mr Milosevic has played a signal and criminal part in the instability which has wracked the region for the last decades, which has produced countless deaths, misery and impoverishment. The sooner he goes the sooner the people of the whole region can look forward to a brighter future which will include rather fairer elections than the ones that Mr Milosevic recognises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
