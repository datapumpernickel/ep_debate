<p class="contents">The creation of the euro is a considerable success in the history of European integration in both political and technical terms. The euro is still a relatively new currency, and it will need to draw on the – widely recognised – experience of the European Central Bank to continue to be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now replacing a President of the European Central Bank for the first time. It is crucial for the European Central Bank and the euro that the selection of a successor to President Duisenberg is carried out transparently and that it is based only on the criteria laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community and in the Statute of the European system of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and on the agreement of the latter on the candidate most qualified for the job.</p>
<p class="contents">In appointing the successor, we must recognise and pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by President Duisenberg, and express our confidence that the European Central Bank will continue to perform all its functions as successfully as it has thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis for the procedure for appointment of the new President of the European Central Bank is Article 112(2)(b) and Article 122(4), of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Articles 11.2 and 43.3 of the Protocol of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with these provisions, the Ecofin ‘Information’ Council adopted a recommendation on 15 July 2003 advocating the appointment of Mr Trichet as President of the European Central Bank for a term of eight years with effect from 1 November 2003. The recommendation was forwarded to both you and the European Central Bank, in accordance with the Treaty, so that you could give your opinion before the recommendation was presented to the Heads of State or Government for the final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Governing Council of the European Central Bank adopted its opinion on 31 July and forwarded it to the Council and Parliament. This opinion confirmed that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank is of the opinion that the proposed candidate is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 112(2)(b) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Parliament will agree with the Council and the European Central Bank that Mr Trichet is an excellent candidate for this important job. The adoption of the opinion by Parliament will allow the Heads of State or Government to take a final decision on the new President of the European Central Bank’s taking up office, within the time-scale set down in the Council recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I recommend that Parliament confirm the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as the appropriate candidate for the office of President of the European Central Bank. The nominee has submitted a written statement and has given oral explanations to the committee in the course of a confirmation process. He has convinced the members of the committee not only of his personal integrity and professional competence, but also of his views on economic and monetary policy in the Eurozone. At the same time, he has shown that he is receptive to the demand for more transparency and democratic accountability for the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years after its foundation, the European Central Bank has come of age. Its independence – in political, economic, financial, organisational and staffing terms – is guaranteed and is not challenged by the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Its high measure of independence, which exceeds that of America’s Federal Reserve, means that the ECB has a high measure of responsibility for macroeconomic and social development. This requires the greatest possible transparency in the interests of democracy and integration policy. For this reason, the transparency of decisions and the decision-making procedure is integral to the European Central Bank’s role. This effort to achieve transparency is reflected in the quarterly monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, in the regular publications and decisions, but also in reports, conferences and the inflation forecasts that are published every six months. A kind of cultural revolution has thus taken place in Europe. The culture of the national central banks in Europe did not have this kind of transparency. Incidentally, transparency is also in the ECB’s interests because it is still a new institution, and is thus especially reliant on establishing and consolidating its legitimacy, credibility and trustworthiness as a European authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, a nation’s monetary system reflects all that the nation stands for and all that it aspires to and endures, to quote Europe’s leading economist Josef Schumpeter. I believe that at the current stage of the debate, incorporating the Maastricht Treaty in its entirety into the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was the right step. Over their centuries of existence, the role of the central banks has undergone radical change, starting with their private form of organisation in history to their changing status in the USA, the concept of combating inflation, and the role of an independent issuing bank. It may be too early to find answers to new challenges today. The task is to define the role of the Central Bank in a globalised world dominated by trade, commerce and international financial markets. That means not only dynamic markets, but also more and higher risks to international financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">What role, then, can and should central banks play in order to contribute to financial stability, to avoid financial crises and to provide assistance? Is the ECB equipped for a role as a lender of last resort? Is this what we want? The euro has enhanced Europe’s international status as well. The ECB will have to play an ever greater role in defining and implementing appropriate policies for the global economy. We are concerned about the dramatic imbalance in the US economy and the risks that may arise for every other part of the world in the mid to long term as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues relating to the ECB’s future policy are tied in with the appointment of its new President. They include the definition of price stability as much as the issue of monetary policy instruments. Maintaining price stability as the primary goal must not result in the ECB removing support for growth and employment from its list of tasks. Monetary policy is not neutral, so the ECB must play a role, as a macroeconomic actor, in coordinating European policies. This is where willingness to engage in ex-post coordination is not enough. Decisions will have to be taken on this issue, and fresh impetus must come from the new President. The European Parliament expects other measures towards greater transparency as well, from the publication of summary reports of decisions, with arguments for and against the decisions adopted, to the (anonymous) results of voting in the ECB Governing Council. What is important is an open and transparent monetary policy in which access to the decision-making process is a given, because this is in all our interests and in the interest of the common good. The future President is able to build on the successful work undertaken by the first ECB President, Wim Duisenberg. The Members of the European Parliament are confident that he will face up to the new challenges and be able to find the right solutions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has three economy and monetary policy criteria by which we also judge the proposal for the new President of the European Central Bank. Only last week, at our study days in Madrid, we redefined and laid down once again the crucial points of our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a clear and unequivocal endorsement of the Stability and Growth Pact. We regard the Stability and Growth Pact as the regulatory framework for the Member States’ budgetary policies. We regard it as a prerequisite for price stability and therefore for sustainable growth and job creation. The Stability and Growth Pact is a driving force for reform, and it is the basis on which to achieve more transparency in the Member States’ budgetary situations. It is also an orientation aid for the new accession countries as they move towards the common currency, in order to be able to fully accept the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second cornerstone is the independence of the ECB. This independence must be expressed through the continuation of the policies that were guided by Wim Duisenberg’s steady hand. It must be expressed through continuity, trust, credibility, professionalism, team spirit, and vigilance towards change, as well as clarity in its decision and a considerable talent for communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our group says a resounding ‘yes’ to the single currency. The single currency is the basis of a functioning internal market and the expansion of the internal market into a home market. These are also the criteria by which we judge the candidate. In both his written statements and oral answers, he voiced unequivocal support for the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, price stability, independence and the single currency, and rejected any attempts to sabotage them as undermining currency stability, price stability, and a policy for growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">When asked about the most important guiding principles, Mr Trichet said, and I quote: ‘The highest level of credibility in the pursuit of the objective of price stability, independence, enshrined in the Treaty, vis-à-vis any power or type of influence whatsoever; lastly, realism and pragmatism in the assessment of a financial and economic environment changing rapidly, due to new technologies and changes in the behaviour of economic agents’.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, he said: ‘Indeed, price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation.’ He made it clear that price stability is not enough on its own, and that it must be supplemented by a judicious budgetary policy, by an appropriate balance of productivity gains and moderate nominal compensation growth, and by urgently needed structural reforms. He pointed out that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall concept and the common rules for the different economic policies of the Member States. In all his answers, he has thus clearly recognised and affirmed our principles as the correct ones. For this reason, my group, too, will endorse his appointment.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Trichet was one of the architects of the Maastricht Treaty and is clearly qualified to head the European Central Bank, but because he is to some extent one of the inventors of the Maastricht criteria which led to 12 of the Union’s Member States adopting the euro, he knows better than anyone that there is nothing scientific about these criteria, which were transferred largely unchanged into the Stability Pact: they are the product of a political compromise that reflects the economic reality and balance of political power of that time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact is not the outcome of an exact science: like any agreement entered into freely, its terms must be complied with. Nevertheless, this pact is not as sacred as Mr Karas would have us believe. It can and must be improved, as Commissioner Monti stated in an interview: it is high time that we made what is an intelligent Stability Pact an even more intelligent Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists is in favour of a stability policy. The fight against inflation is crucial for protecting Europe’s poorest citizens in particular. As, however, the Italian President, Carlo Ciampi underlined, there can be no stability without growth and no growth without stability. This dual policy is, therefore, necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank must fight against inflation, but also against recession. The Bank has objective criteria for combating inflation, but none for combating recession. Furthermore, the European Central Bank must support the Union’s other economic policies: in this regard, combating inflation is extremely important but not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must pull itself together. We cannot confine ourselves to constantly calling for stability.

Consequently, during the three and a half years of his mandate, whilst achieving the same rate of inflation as the United States, we have done infinitely less well than the Americans in the field of investment and stability.</p>

Nevertheless, as we all saw, Mr Trichet renounced his nationality in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, saying ‘I'm not a Frenchman’<span class="italic"> –</span> in order to gain the good graces of the Commission, in which he appears to have succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for our opposition, however, goes deeper. Jean-Claude Trichet is, as every French person knows, one of the instigators of a policy that sacrifices, which has sacrificed and which continues to deliberately sacrifice growth to the Malthusian dogma of stability. For ten years we have been paying for the Central Bank’s monetary policy at a rate of one growth point per year and I must say that I am astonished, Mr Lipietz, that you have become such an ardent royalist.</p>
<p class="contents">During the work of the European Convention, we and by ‘we’ I mean Mr Katiforis and many others, most of the socialists and the Greens, tried to change this dogma and to propose that, in the new European Constitution, as much ambition should be devoted to growth as to stability. We failed and I believe that this Parliament, at least those Members who took part in this struggle, would restore some pride by abstaining on Mr Trichet’s appointment, because he is so emblematic of this policy which has caused and which continues to cause so much damage, as we see on a daily basis, to the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is clearly an exceptionally talented, able and intelligent central banker. However, at the end of our discussions in committee, I felt that despite these qualities he really did not have anything new to say about the euro. He did not have any answers to some of the real economic problems that we are seeing in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">There are increasing levels of unemployment in Germany and France and their economies are in trouble to the extent that neither are able to meet the rules of the Stability Pact. It is clear that there are real economic problems in the eurozone and I have heard nothing from Mr Trichet that would indicate his ability to solve them.</p>
<p class="contents">It came as no surprise to me that the Swedes have decided that they do not want to abolish their national currency. The continuing economic difficulties in the eurozone are one of the many reasons why the UK should not abolish its national currency either.

I believe that his qualities are unanimously recognised by the central bank governors within the euro zone. He has all the qualities to make a rigorous president of the ECB. He does not receive full marks for the monetary policy he will be implementing but I have yet to meet a central bank governor who is open to any other monetary policy. I would say, therefore, that if we are looking for the Eurozone’s economic and monetary policy to be overturned, we should look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add three observations to this statement. Firstly, I hope, and for the moment I have no way of telling whether this will happen, that Mr Trichet will be more open to what we must call economic policy coordination. Because he has been involved since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, he knows very well that this is founded on two pillars: monetary union and economic union. This economic union cannot operate without governments that are able to understand that their budgetary and fiscal policy falls within the realm of the common interest. The role of a central bank governor today, unless he or she wishes to be a permanent scapegoat, is to remind governments of this responsibility. Telling governments that they can avoid having to coordinate economic policies by simply having a monetary policy and instructing them only to undertake structural reform will not enable the Eurozone to tap into a real potential for growth centred on investment in research, development and education.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that, if we want to restore confidence, we will need this economic policy coordination and not just a central bank that applies the criteria strictly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall take the opportunity provided by this morning’s debate to express my astonishment and my concern to see the position adopted by the European Central Bank yesterday, calling for non-inflationist growth and price stability to be included in the objectives of the draft Constitution. I believe that the balance of the wording of Article 3 as produced by the Convention is quite satisfactory and that it would be dangerous to follow the lead of the Central Bank on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the rest, I enjoyed his expertise. Based on the response to the questionnaire drawn up by ECON, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Trichet is like a clone of Mr Duisenberg. I think it will be excellent if this comparison continues to be true in the long-term. The difference between the two was the use of language. You see, psychology is important in monetary policy. Mr Duisenberg never spoke Dutch because English is the main language of the ECB, and as far as I was concerned, Mr Trichet spoke French too much during the hearing. I hope that this does not mean that he will still be a little bit French from a functional point of view, because one would want him to defend the case of the euro in clear language in Paris. The euro will only exist if the people have faith in their currency. For this to happen, we need to have strict enforcement of the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact. I am extremely pleased that Mr Trichet is also of this opinion and is continuing Mr Duisenberg’s policy. It is of the greatest importance that we adhere to the rules of the Stability Pact without political games and without interpreting the rules to promote our own interests. Those who argue for a flexible approach to the rules in order to stimulate growth – I am thinking here of Prime Minister Raffarin, for example, deny or do not understand, or even more seriously, do not want to understand, that the percentages mentioned in the pact already have a structural component which operates within all movements of the economy. I expect Mr Trichet to continue to follow this line in the future and to be consistent when it comes to the execution of the rules and to speak out clearly on this matter in Paris too. I expect the European Commission to do the same and if necessary to impose sanctions on Member States that do not abide by the rules. A tight policy promotes the credibility of monetary union and faith in our euro. According to the classical economy, <span class="italic">die Massengewohnheit der Annahme </span>[the mass custom of acceptance] is the basis for the functioning of money. Our willingness to use the euro in the European Union must be confirmed and increased every day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In his answers before the Parliamentary committee, Mr Trichet emphasised, among other things, the fundamental role of realism and pragmatism in assessing the economic and financial climate at a time of such rapid change. That realism and that pragmatism are, indeed, exactly what is expected of the new president. The citizens of Europe are calling for more economic growth and more employment. Most of the politicians who represent them are calling for more budgetary flexibility and monetary understanding, given the economic crisis which Europe is experiencing. We fail to heed or respond to these worries at the cost not merely of leaving matters unresolved, but also of giving impetus to the collapse of the single currency’s credibility, in the wake of which citizens’ loyalty to Economic and Monetary Union will be weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Swedish referendum and the recent surveys of the level of commitment to Europe in Norway are a sobering warning. We can no longer gloss over the fact that citizens are starting to think that the cost of the euro is too high for Europe. The Stability and Growth Pact, of which the Commission is the guardian and the European Central Bank a fierce advocate, reflects a noble and fundamental ideal, but the way in which it is drafted is not satisfactory because it fails to address crisis situations such as we are in currently.</p>
<p class="contents">Defining broad guidelines for public spending is more important than the level of deficit. The pact does not take this principle into account. Encouraging the deficit in order to lower taxes – a policy which when implemented in isolation brings only a few economic benefits, and always creates inequalities – is one thing; accepting the deficit as the result of investment policies that really do help the economy recover is quite another. The Keynesian benefits of increasing public spending dry up over a certain level, it is true; it is also true, however, that the launch of subsequent initiatives to promote economic growth, which is absolutely crucial to recovery, will never be possible without increasing public spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, it is very strange that there is so much talk today of economic growth initiatives, when the reforms and goals defined for that very purpose in the Lisbon Strategy are still so far from being attained. The ECB, then, is required to show the realism and pragmatism recognised as essential by its President-Elect if the economic system based on the single currency and the common monetary policy, which was constructed so laboriously and with such difficulty, is not to be threatened with collapse. That responsibility, moreover, is in the hands of Mr Trichet. Good luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is due firstly to his professional competence and secondly to his personal qualities, for he will continue the tradition established by Mr Duisenberg. Although my highly esteemed colleague Mrs Villiers criticised Mr Trichet on the grounds that he did not have anything new to say, that is precisely what we are looking for. We want him to stand for continuity as the head of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies especially to the ECB’s core tasks – low inflation, a commitment to the ECB’s independence, and the struggle to uphold the Stability Pact. In this context, I especially hope that, as a Frenchman, he will deal critically with his home country. I also hope that the two Commissioners who are our guests here in plenary today, Mr Solbes and Mr Bolkestein, will fight to uphold the Stability Pact. Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote. What I really do not like about this debate is the constant criticism of the ECB. The ECB is being held responsible for meeting the Lisbon objectives. The main responsibility for meeting the Lisbon objectives lies not with the ECB or indeed with the Commission. They can both contribute to the process, but the chief responsibility lies with the Member States, and a great deal of time has been lost here because Member States have not done their homework. I would ask all of you who regularly hold the ECB responsible and voice criticism of it to be equally or even more critical of the Member States’ failures. I think that would take us much further forward.</p>

One would hope that the appointment would one day be made solely by Parliament. Then it would have greater validity and greater weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the House has the affirmative proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and there is no doubt as to the professional qualifications of the candidate. On the contrary, his impressive career to date is a full guarantee of his personal qualifications. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the economic philosophy which the candidate President of the European Central Bank defended before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with such obstinacy. I am still having trouble understanding how an economist with Mr Trichet's immense experience could maintain that, in times of protracted economic stagnation, increasing public spending may damage the recovery of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">He took recourse to various theoretical sophisms, while it has been known since at least 1910 that the classic antidote to depression and unemployment are public works. I imagine that even Mr Trichet would agree that, without investment, the economic machine cannot restart and I imagine that he himself will note the delay in private investment and the need for us to give impetus to public investment, as Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder have finally understood, albeit belatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, persistence with this philosophy was reason enough to vote against Mr Trichet last week, I greatly fear that it is no longer reason enough, because in the meantime the Swedish people have rejected the euro, forcing all of us to rally round the symbols of the stability of the single currency, which is why I feel it is my obligation – and I believe that I speak at least for my Greek colleagues with similar visions – to support and vote in favour of Mr Trichet.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I hope that he will be forced by events to take a different attitude and stance because the central bankers cannot use their stance to say, as Mr Lipietz said, ‘<span class="italic">après moi le déluge</span>’, [after me the deluge] nor can they say ‘<span class="italic">avant moi le déluge, pendant moi le déluge, et après moi Dieu nous sauve</span>’ [before me the deluge, for the duration of my reign the deluge and after me, may God help us]. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
