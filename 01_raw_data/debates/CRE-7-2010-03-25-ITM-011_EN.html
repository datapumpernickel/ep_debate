That is a fact. We ought to be aware that, with our resolution on the Roma in Europe, which is a document full of politically correct nonsense, we will not be able to come up with or offer a single solution because what we are doing is denying the problem. We should, first of all, observe that we are indeed facing major problems with large numbers of Roma who position themselves completely outside of our society and who are also very often responsible for very serious crimes, small and large. Many values and standards, or the lack thereof, espoused by Roma communities are directly at odds with the values and standards that we wish to see respected in our European countries. What I am saying might sound a little one-sided, but the resolution that we have just adopted is a great deal more one-sided in the opposite direction. In any case, I think that each Member State should itself have the right to decide how to tackle this very serious problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current economic and social situation in many European Union countries requires a special approach to the increasing gap between youth and the labour market, although it is acknowledged that investment in young people and education is investment in the future. Experience shows that during an economic slowdown, young people would rather remain in the education system or begin studies than look for work. We can observe similar tendencies in our countries now. Therefore, I would like to say that the planned measures, a more active labour market and the coherence of the education system are very important. Development of entrepreneurial skills and special programmes are very necessary whether we are talking about ERASMUS’s first work, or other measures. I very much hope that the European Union has sufficient political will to not simply adopt very important documents, but to implement them as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The contrary is true. We should thoroughly reconsider abolishing all kinds of institutions and agencies which have, in effect, become, or always have been, superfluous. However, this Parliament is calling for even more so-called decentralised agencies. I repeat that, as I see it, we have too many of these already. There are some that should be abolished before we go creating a new one.

I consider it particularly beneficial to develop the system of geographical indications and designations of origin while retaining the demanding criteria for obtaining protection. I agree with the retention of the instrument for guaranteeing traditional specialities, with the proviso that the rules for registration should be simplified. In view of the fact that it involves a lower standard of protection, without the need to prove the specific geographical characteristics of the product, I see no reason why the handling of applications should take the same length of time as for geographical indications and designations of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is a weak point in current practice in the power of the Commission to reject applications it considers to be incomplete on a discretionary basis. This often happens haphazardly and arbitrarily, without knowledge of the special characteristics of the product and the geographical area. It is also necessary to establish measures against the circumvention of deadlines in the registration process in the form of the Commission coming up with more and more comments and supplementary questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems, not exacerbate them. Now, as far as development aid is concerned, there are many serious studies that have actually demonstrated that granting development aid in too automatic a fashion invariably results in delays to economic reforms and thus in delays to opportunities for economic growth in developing countries. Despite this, we as Parliament keep taking as our starting point the credo or the so-called axiom that granting ever more development aid in the first instance will help get African countries back on their feet. Despite huge injections of development aid over so many decades, there is, regrettably, no clear evidence that most African countries are not in a far worse position today than immediately after decolonisation. That was my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be very brief with my second point.

Clearly there are people who will be suffering as a result of the economic crisis in these countries, but quite often they are not necessarily the people we want to help. Quite often, they are the governments who are worried about their aid budgets being cut because, with less aid money coming to them, it is more difficult to keep corrupt and inefficient governments in power. When I was in Africa last year talking to many centre-right politicians, they complained to me that aid budgets actually keep corrupt governments in power and it makes it more difficult to improve economic and political governance in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us look at some of the things that we propose. We talk about more investment in developing countries – and everyone would agree to that – yet we have a proposal going through this House, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which will reduce investment in developing countries. We talk about helping developing country farmers, yet we continue, even in today’s budget, to vote for more resources for the common agricultural policy that does so much to damage farmers’ livelihoods in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us really tackle the real source of the problems in these countries – bad governance, and protectionism in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach. Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism. Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to ‘reproductive medicine’ when they mean abortion. This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child. Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an irrelevant report. So: all the assets are in all the stock exchanges in New York, London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc. You will now collect about USD 6 trillion worth of capital. If you sell all the properties which are extra-legal, the slum-valued properties which are not part of the legal system in the developing countries, you will achieve USD 7 trillion. There is a great deal of capital waiting in the developing countries which is outside the legal structures of those countries, from the slums to those millions of businesses you see on the side of the roads which are not part of the formal economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if you ask how much money is coming out of the developing countries every year through the financial systems of the world, it is USD 800 billion. Why are we not working to keep that capital in those countries making those countries richer?</p>

However, I actually feel the need to express my thanks for a number of the observations that were presented in the report. I am thinking in particular of paragraph 27, which very honestly states that the euro should quite naturally lead to closer coordination of economic policies within the euro area. I am, of course, entirely opposed to this statement, but I would like to express my thanks for the clarity and honesty that the rapporteur displays in relation to the euro. Thus, the euro is a construction formed with the intention of creating much greater economic unification in Europe. In other words, finance policy, labour market policy, structural policy – all economic areas, everything that has any significance to the economy – is to be unified. This is what we are currently seeing in Greece, where economists in Frankfurt are telling the Greeks what sort of economic policy they should pursue, and this is what we will see in a few months’ time with regard to Spain and Italy and a whole list of other countries. In this way, the report demonstrates, with all the clarity we could wish for, why Denmark – and my party, the Danish People’s Party, in particular – wishes to remain outside the euro area. We want to decide for ourselves what economic policy we wish to pursue. It is the Danish electorate and not economists in Frankfurt who should decide this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, this financial support is very necessary in the clothing manufacturing industry since, with the dramatic fall in demand for clothes in Lithuania and export areas, there has been a marked reduction in the amount of clothing manufacturing.

Therefore, in spite of the crisis, little progress has been made in the switch to a common international representation for the euro area.

We must see that the recession is not going away, given that the economic situation in almost all the Member States is clearly negative and unemployment is increasing. The specific problem is not one of ‘sound’ finances. Countries such as Greece face problems with public borrowing due to both speculative attacks by the markets and the institutional and political problems of EMU. The crisis in public deficits, which is a general phenomenon throughout the EU, is due, among other things, to the massive scale of tax evasion, which is something that the Commission forgets. Apart from that, the support packages for the banks from national governments also increased public deficits, as the Spanish Presidency admitted in answer to my question on that point. Be that as it may, insistence on the Stability Pact, especially in a recession, is a disaster. It exacerbates social inequalities and results in cuts in public investment, it increases unemployment and it undermines countries’ growth prospects. That is why the anti-growth and anti-social Stability Pact needs to be changed and a different framework needs to be configured for the exercising of economic and social policy, predicated on work and social needs and sustainable, viable growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The need for stricter regulation and supervision of the financial crisis is as urgent as ever. Any European discussion on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI. A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate. Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each Member State. The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States, to ease the bureaucratic burden on them to establish compliance with the tax codes of the states in which they are operating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the things we are told about CCCTB is that it will be more efficient and that it will simplify matters. Given that, as it now stands, companies can opt in or opt out, we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27; that is hardly simplification. As it is currently proposed, CCCTB would mean the redistribution of European profits across the EU, so a country like Ireland, which exports a lot of what it produces, would be penalised because the profits, of course, would be at the point of sale. It does seem a little bit strange since, at the core of the EU, we have the free movement of goods; therefore we would end up, if we use CCCTB, by penalising exporting countries. Its introduction would damage Europe’s capacity to attract foreign direct investment, because the rules as such would not apply to the Member State in which it was located but would be by some reference to a complicated formula which can only be calculated in retrospect, which would damage our capacity to attract foreign direct investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The verdict expressed by my vote has a broader context.</p>
<p class="contents">As predicted by economists, 2009 was the most difficult for crisis-hit Member States. The Union’s GDP fell by 4%, industrial production by 20%, unemployment rose to 23 million and so on. The costs of fighting the crisis have led to a drastic worsening of the situation of public finances. However, some countries, even before the recession, showed a high level of public debt which was in contravention of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">For the euro area, the financial crisis has proved to be the greatest challenge in its history. The crisis has ruthlessly laid bare the weaknesses of the common currency system. The most serious of these is, without doubt, the existence of huge differences between euro area countries in terms of the stability of their public finances and level of debt. It suddenly became apparent that the Stability and Growth Pact, which was, in principle, to be a guarantee of meeting convergence criteria, was being disregarded by national authorities and also by EU authorities. The lack of discipline, and the lack of an appropriate system of penalties, led, as a result, to a crisis of the common currency. Many politicians who are not in favour of European economic integration have already announced the collapse of the euro area, and are circulating a vision of catastrophe for the whole process of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that these views are not justified and are speculative in nature, for the euro area is faced with an opportunity for thorough reform, which will improve mechanisms of supervision and ensure greater coordination. We only need to carry out that process rationally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Vítor Constâncio is taking up the post of Vice-President of the ECB at a difficult time for the euro area. However, his views on the way in which the European Union must respond to the Greek crisis highlight that he has vision and knows how to protect the European currency. Mr Constâncio has an impressive CV. The fact that he is Governor of the Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal) confirms his credentials as a professional. This only serves to remind me of the recent incident involving the political appointment of a vice-president at the National Bank of Romania, anything but the model professional presented by Mr Constâncio. Fortunately, the National Bank of Romania also has a huge number of professionals and its course of action during the current economic crisis has been faultless. However, national banks should be the last place where appointments are made on the basis of political rather than competency criteria. Mr Constâncio had a tough hearing before the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. However, Mr Constâncio did not waver once, continually expressing consistent opinions and demonstrating that his vision of the euro area’s future is sound. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although his nomination has been known since November, just a few days prior to his nomination hearing in the committee, information was spread about Mr Fazakas’ possible collaboration with the state secret police. I am astonished that the question of Mr Fazakas’ competency is only being raised now, as Hungary is preparing for elections, whereas in the five years that Mr Fazakas has been a Member of the European Parliament, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control and Quaestor, the question of his competency and ability to carry out his duties was not raised. I am convinced that the European Parliament is no place for nebulous political games; therefore, I supported Mr Fazakas’ nomination. I think that there was ample time between November and the hearing for the interested parties to provide suitably substantiated information about circumstances that could have had an influence on Mr Fazakas’ appointment to the European Court of Auditors and to ensure an exhaustive parliamentary assessment, but this was not done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sets a serious precedent. I voted together with the EPP against Mr Fazakas’ confirmation as a Member of the Court of Auditors. This was no ordinary vote. Mr Fazakas is suspected of being an ex-collaborator of the Communist secret services. The Hungarian press produced a document regarding this. A number of opinions were heard that opposed any ‘punishment’ against Mr Fazakas. They asked for the past not to be revived. This is wrong. The past is not dead. Tens of millions of eastern Europeans still live a life troubled by the Communist horrors. If the past is dead, then there is no sense in leading a life guided by norms and values. This would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility. Public office would lose dignity. Anyone, however corrupt or immoral, could stand for public office. If there still are politicians unaware of the Communist record in eastern Europe, this does not qualify them for an informed opinion. The perpetrators of the Communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress. Mr Fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it. This lack of honesty should not be rewarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very recently, the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile showed how very vulnerable people are to the suffering and harm caused by natural disasters. However, in the case of both countries, cooperation between the EU and the UN worked very well during rescue and assistance of the victims. It is my opinion that we should now concentrate on optimising this cooperation, in order to make the best use of available resources, so that we can not only rescue as many victims as possible as quickly as possible, but also enable them to survive later. In addition, another crucial question is assistance in maintaining order and in rebuilding a disaster-hit country. Despite the fact that all Member States of the EU also belong to the UN, and that the European Union has the status of permanent observer at the UN, it is difficult to develop a harmonious position shared by all EU countries. I am sure that on matters concerning effective cooperation during aid operations in crisis situations brought on by natural disasters, developing a common, constructive approach is a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking, nevertheless, about a minority of 10-12 million people across Europe who lead their lives according to their own rules dating back hundreds of years and feel that it is natural for them to behave like this, in isolation within a majority. In Romania, according to some estimates, the Roma minority amounts to more than 2 million. This is larger than the Hungarian minority and, some would logically say, stronger. However, the Roma minority in Romania has failed to appoint its own leader to represent this group in public or in the Romanian Parliament. This fact may also be the reason that all the national social inclusion programmes have completely failed. At the moment, given that the Roma population is spreading across the territory of several European states and is known for its tendency towards migration and involvement in crime (a fact which has led to the use of the term ‘gypsy’ to refer to many other citizens as well), the solution to the social inclusion issue has become a Community one. It is likely that where Member States have failed (something which they are often criticised for), the European Union will succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An analysis must be carried out of all the practices which have successfully achieved Roma integration, using them as a basis to finally draw up and adopt a European strategy for dealing with this group which is, as is well known, the largest minority on EU territory. The main emphasis must continue to be placed on education, schooling for children, vocational training, phased entry into work, women’s empowerment, streamlining the social insurance system, etc. In this area too, much closer cooperation is required between the European Commission and Member State governments on funding projects through the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, as well as specific programmes which focus more on individual empowerment than on the traditional hierarchy. In my view, a broad information campaign aimed at the general public and Roma population, which counters the feeling of Roma exclusion from European social life and puts heavy emphasis on the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, is a vital component in this synergy of Community actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These are all good proposals, but they do not take into account the state of degradation in which many Roma communities in certain Member States, such as Italy, find themselves, often by choice.

<p class="contents">The response to this critical situation ought to be the full application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens, which provides for the removal of EU citizens who, after a stay of three months in a Member State, cannot demonstrate a regular source of income and who refuse to embark on the process of integration offered by national and/or local authorities.</p>

This House is also calling on the Member States to make greater and more visible measures to respond to the Roma’s legitimate rights, taking into account the fact that measures to combat discrimination are not sufficient to facilitate their social inclusion. Concerted efforts at Community level are necessary, including financial contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution recommends that the Council adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding, reflecting the European political commitment to promote Roma inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Second European Roma Summit focuses on strategic policy commitments that demonstrate a political will to close the gap between Roma communities and majority populations in various countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are talking about the 10 or 12 million Roma in the EU. When compared with others, examined here on other occasions, it brings us face to face with a hierarchy of people which henceforth places the Roma minority at the top, then migrants from outside Europe, then Europeans of non-European origin and, finally, right at the bottom, those of European ‘origin’. If we then add the ‘gender dimension’ and the reigning cult of youth, we can conclude that in your so-called European Union, it is not great to be a man who is middle-aged, European, and of European origin and not part of any ethnic, cultural, religious or sexual minority that you care to identify as such. When will there finally be a policy that serves Europeans first? When will priority be given to these poor workers, to these middle classes crushed by taxes, to these unemployed, and to these families who are simply European and form the vast majority of the inhabitants of the European Union and are the citizens for whom we are responsible and who you only think about on the eve of elections? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are using this resolution to ask the new commissioners to give priority to the aspects of their portfolios relating to the Roma and to stop pursuing the current policy, which is long-winded, but devoid of any real action.

The motion correctly points out that anti-discriminatory measures are insufficient in themselves to promote the social integration of the Roma. Harmonised Community efforts resting on a secure legal foundation are needed in order to bring together all social and institutional actors and, at the same time, exert pressure on the participants to keep their own promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is extremely important that the resolution unequivocally takes a stand beyond ‘soft law’ instruments in support of binding legislative commitments and realistic budgetary contributions. Finally, let me express my hope that the European Commission, in accordance with Parliament’s explicit instruction and the approval of the European Council, will set in motion as soon as possible the complex development programme described in the resolution. This can at last put an end to the perpetuation of extreme poverty afflicting the Roma from generation to generation, it can make concerted efforts simultaneously in all related policy areas, and it will be able to intervene promptly in regions struggling with serious structural deficits and which are in the process of turning into ghettoes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Structural Funds offer a huge opportunity for achieving the Roma population’s social inclusion. However, the procedural and content aspects involved have, unfortunately, made it difficult to utilise this opportunity. When applied in Romania, it has been noted that a different approach needs to be adopted on the employment issue when the Roma segment of the population is involved, as part of the measures implemented by POSDRU (Sectoral Operational Programme for the Development of Human Resources). Conventional measures involving professional retraining, consultancy and providing information to Roma beneficiaries must also take into account the specific nature of their culture. Although beneficiaries from rural areas are most affected, there has never been any kind of programme for the Roma communities as part of the European programmes aimed at rural development. The Roma are not included among the target groups favoured by such funding programmes. Launching programmes for developing agricultural enterprises, encouraging the setting up of livestock farms, along with a package of incentives such as subsidies for employers in this sector, are solutions to be included in the equation when it comes to integrating the Roma population into the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must express our concern regarding the discrimination suffered by Roma in terms of education, housing and employment, as well as equal access to the health care system and other public services. We condemn the recent escalation in hostility towards the Roma (Romaphobia) in a number of EU Member States, regularly displayed in the form of hate speeches and attacks against the Roma population. We call again on the Commission to adopt a horizontal approach to the Roma issue and to draft additional proposals aimed at implementing a coherent policy at European level on Roma social inclusion. With this in mind, we ask the Commission to prepare a European Roma strategy in cooperation with Member States to provide better coordination of and promote the efforts aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population. Furthermore, I hope that Member States will use the various instruments currently available more efficiently to combat Roma exclusion, such as allocating a maximum of 2% of ERDF resources to be used for housing for marginalised communities or the existing options as part of the ESF. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, indications are of a budget aimed at deepening the single market, at the lack of job security known as flexicurity, at liberalisation, and at the commercialisation of the environment and growing areas of social life. Although they have been grouped together under the so-called new ‘2020 strategy’, these are old guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The stated priority given to young people does not obscure the fact that the intention is to start planning from this point on for future generations of workers for whom unemployment will be structural, seen as a strategic variable to impose the devaluation of their labour power. This will oblige even the qualified to flit between insecure jobs, alternating them with the inevitable unemployment. These are priorities that also put the 2011 budget at the service of the EU’s external interventionism; of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy; of militarism and war; of policies that criminalise immigration; of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, our only response to this report can be to vote against it. However, this is neither the only way nor inevitable. We tried to demonstrate just that with the various proposals that we tabled during the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It therefore gave me all the more satisfaction, during the vote, to endorse Mrs Jędrzejewska’s report on the 2011 budget and the motion for a European Parliament resolution, both of which provide for ambitious budget priorities for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the traditional priorities, such as cohesion policy and support for innovative and ecological technologies, the 2011 budget should concentrate on ensuring full operation of the new initiatives in the EU: the European External Action Service, the EU 2020 economic strategy and measures which are part of the Eastern Partnership. All three face the threat of becoming a fiasco if the funds designated for them prove to be too ‘symbolic’.</p>
<p class="contents">Also worthy of note is the comprehensive approach to the question of young people. Faced by demographic problems, the EU must not allow itself to have a low percentage of educated young people, because this would lead to a still greater rise in unemployment in that age bracket, which is something the EU simply cannot afford. Therefore, the European budget must have funds reserved to support language learning, intercultural dialogue, increasing the mobility of young people and integration of graduates in the job market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite simply, what is being asked for is a larger budget; in other words, more taxes for Europeans. It is true that the rapporteur’s concern to ensure that spending funded by the EU budget is not only useful but effective and that it brings genuine European added value to national policies is worthy of praise. However, to be quite honest, this should have been a constant concern over the years. On the one hand, I recall that in the last 14 or 15 years, this has not been the case, since the European Court of Auditors did not feel able to approve the execution of the annual budgets. On the other hand, I am still looking for concrete proposals in this report that will enable this objective to be achieved. In particular, I am looking for the proposals by which to put an end to programmes that are nothing but pure populism, the useless allocation of small amounts of funding, ideological propaganda and attempts to intervene more in areas in which the EU fortunately has only few powers and, above all, is ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also voted for Amendment 5, bearing in mind that unemployment is a key topic in current discussions and that, in order to be able to tackle fully the issue of the already high and ever-growing unemployment rate, the EU must implement an ambitious social agenda. The European Union must invest, above all, in research and in the transport and energy infrastructure in order to be able to remain competitive globally.

The budget will have to be accurately balanced to ensure the successful realisation of the goals set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, like the creation of a common internal energy market for example. In planning the budget, significant attention must also be focused on the consequences of the financial crisis, still being felt by many countries, and efforts to effectively remove these. The main priority must continue to be job retention and creation, which is closely linked to the need for financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises that create a large portion of jobs. When approving the 2011 European Parliament budget, particular attention must be paid to evaluating the European Parliament’s priority – the forming of high level lawmaking – and all necessary measures must be provided for that goal. An appropriate solution must also be found to the question of the effective organisation of the EP’s work, including the establishing of one workplace for MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quality of our agricultural products is something that needs to be capitalised on. We devote a lot of time in the European Union to making sure that the highest standards in farming are met; our livestock is well treated and healthy; our produce is safe; our farming practices ethical in relation to their impact on the environment. Every step of the industry’s chain of production is regulated, ‘from farm to fork’ so to speak. In order to make the most of the industry’s unique selling point – the high quality of its output – we need further promotion as pointed out in the Scottà report. It is all very well to have products that are labelled according to their area of farming or according status as a traditional speciality, but unless the consumer is aware of its meaning, it is, in fact, like reading an alien language. So I agree that the report’s recommendation for the Commission to promote awareness of this information will be an effective form of marketing. It will help customers and small businesses alike. It could be particularly beneficial to our agri-food sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a clear link between product quality and the origin of the raw materials. The proposal for a ‘place of farming’ label will indicate where the raw materials come from. This seems to me to represent an important opportunity for the agriculture industry, which produces high quality agricultural products. Clear labelling of the origins of products not only guarantees consumers the best product quality but also enables them to make a decision on the basis of objective and transparent criteria. Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European agri-food producers. The production of high quality foods is often the only employment opportunity in many rural areas with limited production alternatives. Therefore, I am very much in favour of the Protected Geographical Indication and Protected Designation of Origin, together with the reintroduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain regions and GMO-free areas. The Traditional Speciality Guaranteed and Organic Farming schemes must also be retained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Geographical indications give agricultural products greater credibility and a higher profile in consumers’ eyes, while also providing a competitive environment for producers.

The geographical indication system is well established in the European Union and in many countries outside the EU, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand. However, the EU has, unfortunately, commercial partners who do not have legislation in this area. For this reason, European products are not well protected within these states’ national systems, with the risk of counterfeiting occurring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, I am delighted that we are opposing the merging of the two concepts of PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) as proposed by the European Commission. It is true that simplifying the standards may, at first sight, seem desirable in terms of reducing the bureaucratic burden, but it must not result in a reduction of the standards that our European producers have courageously imposed on themselves.

Consumers have a right to accurate and clear information on the content and origin of goods and regarding whether or not they have been genetically modified. Clear common rules create the conditions for a functioning market on equal terms within the EU. When the market is functioning correctly, informed consumers can, through their choices, drive development towards even higher food quality. However, I voted against the report on agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow? (<a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2009/2105(INI)">2009/2105(INI)</a>). The main reason for this is that the report violates the principle of subsidiarity. For example, it is not the job of the EU to create a ‘European knowledge bank for old recipes and historical food preparation methods’. In my opinion, protected geographical indications receive too great an emphasis in the report. There is also a risk of setting up barriers to trade for countries outside the European Union when there is such a strong emphasis on the goods being produced within the EU. Origin marking is important, but, in itself, the origin is not necessarily a guarantee that the product is of high quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report expresses the EU philosophy of producing foodstuffs in order to increase the profits of the food industry, not to meet the people’s food requirements. At a time when one billion people are suffering from hunger and poverty is striking broad sections of grassroots society in the capitalist countries, the EU is using food standards as a pretext for restricting production, concentrating land in large capitalist undertakings and ousting small-scale and poor farmers from their land and agricultural production. The cases of food scandals that have multiplied in recent years, due to the capitalist conditions of food production being increasingly imposed by the EU and the WTO, will never be effectively addressed with administrative control measures, nor can GMOs coexist with conventional and organic foods. Only food sovereignty and security, the safeguarding of safe, healthy, cheap food, support for poor farmers and the establishment of production cooperatives within the framework of people power and a people’s economy can meet modern grassroots requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is especially important to agree on economic partnerships to strengthen the compatibility of EU policy for the good of development and, inter alia, the promotion of suitable work, welfare and job creation and ensure the appropriate implementation of trade commitments and the application of a suitable transition period for these commitments. Developing countries need aid to reduce poverty and isolation, measures to contribute to development and measures essential to get out of the crisis. In implementing these actions, the European Union must take the lead and act decisively and, to this end, all EU institutions must make greater commitments.

However, the developing countries are also suffering heavily from its effects and they are largely powerless to do anything about it. Irresponsible speculation, greed for quick profits which are completely unrelated to the real economy in the Anglo-Saxon countries and a financial system that is coming apart at the seams have brought the world to the brink of a financial abyss. Another cause of the crisis is a globalisation concept that has made complete deregulation its highest priority. The countries of Europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies. However, in many cases, it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation. Therefore, they must be given the opportunity to protect their own national economies more effectively against imported goods which are sold at dumping prices and which destroy local markets and local people’s livelihoods. We must give the developing countries the chance to emerge from the crisis under their own steam. Traditional development aid has largely failed in its purpose. Ultimately, we have to tackle the root of the problem and impose strict regulations on the financial markets, prevent speculative practices and quickly introduce a tax on financial transactions. The problem will certainly never be solved by the type of ‘world government’ proposed in the report, which will further disempower both people and states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of resulting in a reduction in development aid for developing countries, this situation should cause an increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The common objective should be to allocate 0.56% of gross national income to development aid by 2010, and 0.7% by 2015. Apart from temporary aid, other measures are also needed which will change the architecture of world economic governance. This explains my support for the immediate fulfilment of obligations undertaken at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on the matter of a shift in the IMF quota share to emerging and developing countries of at least 5%, and an increase of at least 3% in voting power in the World Bank for developing and transition countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures should be correlated with action to end tax havens. An important solution for the financial system, the introduction of which is worth considering, too, is what is known as the Tobin tax.

The cohesion of the policies applied by the ECB and consistent, yet relevant measures have ensured that the impact of the crisis has been kept to a minimum in the euro area. The exception to this, Greece, came about due to systemic errors compounded over time and kept hidden. The impact of the economic crisis has been felt significantly harder outside the EU’s euro area. Romania is an example of this where, in spite of current appropriate economic measures, the impact of the crisis is considerable. The effects would have been much smaller if there was fiscal responsibility, and Romania would not have entered the first year of the crisis, 2009, with a 5.4% budget deficit at a time when, just one year before, it reported record economic growth. While states in the euro area have already been reporting a shift into the black for their own economies during the last six months, the first shoots of economic recovery, albeit fairly modest, are evident in Romania only now. However, this cannot be sustained without a drastic reduction in the budget deficit, which is required to prevent us from ending up in the same situation as Greece. The mechanisms for imposing penalties on Member States in the case of failure to meet the vital macro-economic indicators must be deployed without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, there has been a decrease in loans granted to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers and the anticipated reduction in consumer borrowing rates has not come about. At the same time, the ECB has demonstrated once again that it is unable to put an end to the mockery being perpetrated by the merchant banks, which borrow from the ECB at a rate of 1% and lend to the states at much higher interest rates. It must be acknowledged that the independence of the central banks was not the right choice, both from the point of view of democratic and political control and from the point of view of economic efficacy.

It is interesting to note that the report itself does not hold back from making some criticisms of the ECB’s actions. This is, of course, the case when it notes that the ECB’s economic projections, like those of the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions, failed to predict the severity of the downturn in 2008. It also does so when it ‘notes that the ECB’s interest rate cuts were less radical than those made by other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the UK, and compared with what many economic observers expected at the time’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report continues to defend the ECB and its guidelines, even making major contradictions. That is why we voted against it. Nonetheless, there are other aspects that merit reflection, specifically when it expresses its ‘disappointment that the extra liquidity injected by the ECB did not sufficiently ease the credit crunch faced by industry, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, and was instead used by some banks to improve their margins and cover losses’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We continue to want to ‘reassure’ completely irrational markets that increase hostile speculation against a State, when we should be eliminating speculation by renouncing monetary orthodoxy.

Clearly, more than any other time, there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach. In the last two weeks, two former high ranking officials in Ireland’s biggest bank have been arrested in dawn raids. This is a dramatic statement of the need for responsible and moral financial management. There is just one point I would like to make, and that is the greater need for transparency in our financial institutions, be it at regional, national or EU level. This report calls for greater transparency which I am sure the majority of MEPs will support</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly draw attention to the emphasis his report places on the importance of economic growth as the best means to tackle excessive deficits. This is a clear response to those who argue for an undue focus on short-term cuts to expenditure, which could in fact jeopardise longer-term growth. Deficits must be steadily reduced over the coming years, as the economy recovers from the effects of the financial crisis, but growing our way out of the crisis is the only effective option to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and protect citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The year 2008, which saw the beginning of the acute phase of the biggest economic crisis for several decades, determined the ways in which the world economy and the European economy would develop for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Central Bank, the last two years were, without doubt, the most difficult period in its history. The ECB had to tackle a crisis which had hit the European economy severely. Rising budget deficits in Member States combined with growing debt are the primary macro-economic consequences of the crisis. In accordance with the treaty, the ECB is primarily responsible for ‘price stability’, which means low inflation. Has the ECB fulfilled its role? It is hard to be sure. It is true that the current level of inflation is below the ceiling fixed by the ECB, but it should be pointed out that in the first months of the crisis it jumped to its highest ever level in the euro area, only to fall, suddenly, later.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that this instability can be explained by the surprise which the crisis caused. From October 2008 onwards, the ECB’s monetary policy can be described as active and flexible. The ECB adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world. We are still waiting for the results of these actions. Europe is coming out of the crisis, but the situation is still uncertain. Is the ECB ready for the possibility of another crisis, a possibility which is seen by some economists? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, there has to be much in the way of compromise and this tends to disguise the differences which also exist. I am particularly concerned that, at a time when questions are being asked about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of the USA, similar searching questions are missing from our debate concerning the ECB. Of particular concern is the relevance of micro-supervisory oversight and whether the ECB, by dint of its role in the recent crisis, is automatically qualified to be involved so directly in this endeavour or whether it will carry with it significant reputational risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
