<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. –</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, it was not by chance that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved – with only one vote against – this report on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters. It approved it not because of any bias against the use of government or State initiatives when it comes to creating a European area of justice, as anyone not quite paying attention might imagine given what happened this morning. Quite the contrary – I believe that apart from the areas of immigration and asylum, that is, ultimately, apart from the area of the free movement of persons, initiatives like this one are, of course, welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">What such initiatives cannot do, and this is what concerns Parliament, is to make up for the inconsistencies between the Member States which lead to such a legislative mire, with each Member State doing its own thing with initiatives to suit its own taste, without a genuine Community vision and ignoring their joint responsibility. They are also overlooking the need for a serious and coherent body of legislation, which the Commission is proving it is possible to achieve – and I am looking at Commissioner Vitorino now – in one of the most sensitive areas. That area is a model for coexistence in Europe and the fundamental freedoms associated with it, in this case freedom of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, with particular reference to the area covered by this report, in which the proper functioning of the single market implies a strengthening of the European social area, anything new – even in the Member States – which helps to eliminate and reduce cross-border disputes and litigation is, of course, to be welcomed, and I believe that tomorrow's vote will reflect that.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the ultimate aim of this German initiative? It involves giving a court in any Member State the ability, during any legal proceedings concerning certain civil and commercial matters that have taken place in another Member State, to use its best endeavours to obtain evidence essential for progressing the main proceedings in the court of the requesting country. Up to now, international cooperation on the taking of evidence has been governed by the Hague Convention of 1970, the scope of which is limited since it only applies to those Member States that have ratified the Convention. As far as I know, only eleven Member States have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that without a legal instrument covering the Union's 15 Member States and those that may join subsequently, not all members of the public taking legal action through the courts will have the same legal remedies; it will depend on whether or not their country or the requested country has ratified the Convention. Under this new regulation, all courts will be covered by the same law, and all EU citizens will benefit from the same protection given that this Community instrument will facilitate direct contact between courts in different countries. Ultimately, this will remove obstacles to the creation of a European legal area, either by creating a standard European form to be used by the courts in the requesting States in the language of the requested courts, so as to facilitate communication between the two, or by creating a central authority in each country which will receive and forward requests originating from another State for the taking of evidence from a national court, or by establishing the principle that the entire request must be responded to, and obliging requested European courts to execute this request within six months, at the end of which, if they have not complied, they will have to provide an explanation to the requesting court.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that I have made to this initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany include imposing a duty on the central authorities to produce legal guidance on the official languages recognised by each court in each of the Member States and a duty to provide information on accredited legal translation agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in view of these innovative arrangements, which will greatly speed up the proceedings of courts in all the Member States, which seems to me to be one of the key aims of the German initiative, I have proposed that only in exceptional circumstances should the direct contact between courts envisaged in the regulation be superseded by traditional consular channels, which I believe are inevitably cumbersome, bureaucratic, somewhat remote from events and in many ways responsible for the delays in litigation in cross-border disputes or proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members from other groups did not fully grasp this last point and therefore voted against this amendment. The objective, as I saw it, was merely to emphasise a certain concept of Europe which I espouse: a Community with its own law, but more than just a diplomatic Community or one based on international law. I have therefore tabled this amendment again in the hope that the majority of Members will now understand this point of detail, which is, in fact, more than just a detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you very much for preparing a subject which at first seems very technical, but which, as you quite rightly stressed, has a very substantial part to play in creating a citizens' Europe, because cross-border business is on the increase. We have a European single market, we have a single European currency, and we will soon have the coins and notes of that currency in our pockets. Because of e-commerce, we will see exponential growth in cross-border contracts, and it is a sad fact that problems sometimes arise with contracts, resulting in legal disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The taking of evidence is generally at the heart of any legal dispute, as matters of law are often easy to settle, but there are often widely varying interpretations when it comes to the facts. If it is necessary to determine the facts of a case which took place in another Member State, then the present situation as regards mutual legal assistance is simply anachronistic, and involves using the Hague Convention through diplomatic channels, making matters very complicated and time-consuming, and also unreliable. A court case often comes to a standstill quite simply because the facts of the case cannot be established, and quite simply because the resources for mutual legal assistance are not available. That is why it is so important that the Federal Republic of Germany has brought forward this proposal, and that is why my group is so firmly supporting this initiative, because it provides for greater certainty, swifter administration of the law and, last but not least, greater justice for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This legal instrument will also help to counter a trend which I view with increasing scepticism. By that I mean the tendency to resort to extrajudicial dispute resolution, that is to say bringing in a neutral arbitrator instead of going to court, or letting some kind of board of arbitration make a ruling. This is actually a trend that runs counter to the idea of the constitutional state. This is a trend, and I am happy to say so in this Chamber, which also runs counter to parliamentary democracy, because our system is, in fact, designed on the assumption that parliaments make laws and an independent judiciary apply those laws. Anything that represents a deviation from these procedures is at odds with the original concept of the constitutional state which all of us here have in our sight.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can make cross-border legal relations easier, then we also make it easier for companies and individual citizens to operate within systems guaranteed by the State. The single market needs an efficient legal system, failing which all our efforts to create competition and increasing prosperity in the European Union will come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I must confess that it makes me feel somewhat uneasy that we keep having to consider initiatives from Member States here. I can be particularly forthright in saying that in this particular case, because this initiative emanates from my own country. I find it embarrassing that we in the European Parliament are not in a position to present such initiatives, and this report should also make us think once again about whether the European Parliament should not have a right of initiative, particularly in this area, which is such a sensitive one in the public's eyes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The regulation with which we are dealing applies solely to civil and commercial matters where a court in one Member State can request evidence on the performance of judicial acts from another competent court in another Member State of the European Union. The regulation provides for the establishment of central authorities which are not responsible for the actual transmission of documents but which will respond to requests for supplying information from requested agencies. We must recall that the Treaties of the European Union incorporated judicial cooperation in civil matters in 1993. This is certainly a matter of common interest for Member States and it does indeed complement the workings of the internal market. The establishment of an area of freedom, justice and security confers on members of the judiciary an essential role to play in the effective workings of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter may be highlighted to an even greater extent with the advent and introduction of the single currency next year. While I certainly support judicial cooperation within the EU, I do not support the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor. I do not support the establishment of such a body because I believe that the rights of our citizens should be fully protected. In Britain and in Ireland we have a different legal system – the old common law system – to that which pertains in the majority of other Member States. The problem for a European Public Prosecutor is simply what is the legal basis for such a prosecution. Do you apply the rule that a person is innocent until proven guilty – which exists in the common law system – or do you apply another legal basis which exists in other Member States of the Union? I do not believe that this square can be circled.</p>
<p class="contents">Judicial cooperation is important because it complements the workings of the internal market and the single currency, as already stated. Europol is effective and Europol must be supported in ensuring that crimes such as trafficking in human beings, cyber-crime and so on can be dealt with within the European territories. However, I believe that the establishment of the Public Prosecutor's Office is a step too far. It is unworkable and it would be an unwelcome move which would not command support among the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I support the regulation which is before us today. I believe the implementation of this regulation concerning the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters will certainly improve and accelerate cross-border proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By virtue of this specific reference in the Treaty, this question was included by the Council in the Vienna Action Plan, in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, and it was subsequently covered in the Commission's scoreboard for the establishment of a common area of freedom, security and justice. As mentioned by the rapporteur, whom I would like to congratulate on his excellent report, this question was addressed in the 1970 Hague Convention on the taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters, which has to date only been ratified by 11 of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in the mobility of persons within the common area of the European Union is one of the factors that has made an important contribution to the growth in the number of law cases with cross-border implications. For example, when it comes to taking evidence, legal proceedings taking place under the jurisdiction of one Member State increasingly involve taking evidence from witnesses resident in another Member State. This is why it has become necessary to adopt clear and effective rules on cooperation between courts in the Member States with a view to facilitating the taking of evidence in such situations. These rules will no doubt represent a significant step forward in the work currently being done to improve access to justice, either on the part of individuals or of companies, and also in pursuing the wider objective of creating a European legal area in civil matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, this regulation will enhance the value of European citizenship and of protecting and guaranteeing our citizens' individual rights, and it is also of not insignificant economic importance, in that by facilitating the taking of evidence, it will make swifter and more effective administration of justice more economically viable, and in particular administration of justice more in line with the necessities of a new economic reality, of the single market, the single currency and electronic democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these considerations, the Commission welcomes the German initiative for a regulation in this field. Furthermore, the Commission does not have any bias against initiatives by Member States, especially when such initiatives are in line with the priorities defined by the Tampere European Council. The German initiative also gives us an opportunity to move forward and modernise the rules of the 1970 Hague Convention, with the added value of adopting a Community instrument that can be uniformly and directly applied to the legal system of each of the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an initial phase, the central objective of which is to create the mechanisms needed to strengthen mutual confidence between the legal and judicial systems of the 15 Member States. This initial phase should, once the effects of implementing the regulation have been assessed, open up the way for more ambitious objectives, and in particular those which would make it possible for the requesting court to ask for a special procedure to be employed by the requested court in performing a judicial act, together with the option of the requesting court being associated with the performing of the judicial act by the requested court.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the support the rapporteur has given to this initiative. Furthermore, the Commission is in sympathy with the general points he has raised, and with the general approach of the amendments he has proposed. I can assure you that for our part we will closely monitor and assist the discussions on this initiative in the relevant Council committee, with a view to producing a text which precisely reflects the concerns expressed by Parliament in the Marinho report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
