<p class="contents">This is an important directive, as it would introduce a ban on the cleaning agent 'nonylphenol' that has been identified as posing unacceptable risks to the aquatic environment. It is a very far-reaching proposal, as it bans the marketing and use of nine different applications where the substance could be released into the aquatic environment. The proposed directive will therefore encourages the marketing and use of safer alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal sets a strict limit for chromium -6 in cement, as chromium -6 has been shown to induce disabling and allergic eczema, especially among cement workers. In the EU each year, hundreds of new invalidity cases occur which cause high costs for the occupational insurance systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and the environment, but also preserves the Internal Market, as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiation procedure that is about to be concluded has benefited from the close cooperation between Parliament, Council and the Commission. I am very glad about this successful work together, and I hope that this important directive can now be finalised. I therefore agree to all the amendments proposed by Mr Lannoye for this compromise, so that this important directive can be finalised in first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we shall not be short of compliments today. I should like, on behalf of all my colleagues, to thank the Commission for its proposal. It is an excellent proposal, and the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was made easier by the fact that the basis for discussion was very good right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commissioner, I would remind the House that nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates – I shall refer to them as NPEs to facilitate the discussion – are classified as substances which are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. These substances accumulate biologically in aquatic species, and they have also been shown to have an endocrine-disrupting effect. The 2000 water framework directive classifies them as hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to put an end to the use of these substances in eight specific fields, and the Committee on the Environment, on that basis, proposes that the area of application be extended to include co-formulants in pesticides as well as active substances and co-formulants in biocides. The Commission also proposes that the concentration threshold for NPEs should be brought into line with the one proposed for nonylphenols, or NPs, in other words it should be based on a limit value of 0.1%. It is also asking for an amendment to the directive on sewage sludge, so as to introduce a concentration limit value for these same substances contained in sewage sludge.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cement is concerned, when it contains chromium VI in non-negligible quantities it can cause allergic reactions if it comes into contact with the hands. Personal protective measures, such as the wearing of gloves, are certainly necessary, but it has been found that they are not sufficient to prevent reactions of this type. The addition of a reducing agent, usually ferrous sulphate, reduces chromium VI to a harmless chemical form. The Committee on the Environment proposes that the addition of a reducing agent be extended to cover all cements containing more than two parts per million (ppm) of chromium VI, with an exemption restricted to cases where the cement is used in closed-circuit fully automated systems. This is an essential measure, both for the workers concerned, and I am thinking in particular of construction workers, and for the public purse, which has to pay out sizeable amounts of compensation to the victims of allergic dermatitis. I would point out that we have a figure for Germany of EUR 36 million per year in compensation, which enables us to measure the economic impact of this problem. I would also point out that chromium VI is a carcinogenic and mutagenic substance which is suspected of causing lung cancer and cancer of the respiratory tract as a result of its presence in dust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment is therefore asking for two things. Firstly, with regard to the directive on the protection of workers against risks from chemical agents, it is asking for an amendment introducing a limit value for the concentration of dust in the atmosphere. Secondly, it is asking for provision to be made, in other sectors which use chromium VI in various products, for legislative initiatives of the same kind as those that have been adopted for end-of-life vehicles and for electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal, as I have already said, was very good right from the start, which made our task easier and enabled us to envisage, after discussion with the Council’s representatives, consultations before the plenary vote, so as to obtain agreement at first reading. The vote in the Committee on the Environment enabled us to take this step, and it was accepted by the representatives of the various political groups within the Committee on the Environment, for which I thank them. We have thus obtained agreement between the three institutions, though not on every point, because it is clear that differences of opinion still exist on a certain number of points, but we have at least reached agreement on the essential points before the plenary vote. Where I come from there is a proverb which says that the best is the enemy of the good. For my part, I have always thought that the good, in this case, consisted of obtaining a result, since the objective was essentially to speed up the implementation of the adopted texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to thank, officially and most sincerely, the Commissioner and the Commission officials, as well as the Greek Presidency of the Council, for allowing us to reach an overall agreement which will be put to the vote tomorrow. It will thus be possible to implement very rapidly what I personally regard as the most important proposal, namely the proposal to eradicate an industrial disease, the allergic dermatitis caused by the presence of chromium VI in cement, which is one of the most damaging diseases and one of the most costly to society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sorry that at the beginning of the negotiations I had to be so inflexible and stubborn, but I am pleased to say that once the Greens, for once, started to talk sense, we could also show some flexibility. With the Council's acceptance of this compromise, the measures contained in this report can be brought into force without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come together on three important issues: firstly, on the issue of cement. Nobody argues with the fact that hexavalent chromium causes dermatitis but, of course, we must not forget that only 50% of dermatitis cases are linked to this particular cause. As the rapporteur has said, dosing cement with ferrous sulphate counteracts this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial suggestion from the Commission was that we should limit this dosing to cement used for manual use. But the whole of Parliament agreed this was very hard to define as even, for example, when one is pouring a large motorway bridge or laying a large floor, there is a certain amount of manual work involved in grouting or finishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise we came to was only to exempt uses in closed industrial applications, for example, the manufacture of concrete blocks, concrete lintels or other products of that type.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue regarding cement was the risks of long-term exposure. The rapporteur has talked about the carcinogenic and mutagenic problems of chromium-6 but, of course, nobody is realistically suggesting that the levels of chromium-6 in cement pose a risk. However, we need to look at the problem without raising undue concerns which would worry the workers in this industry and make the insurance industry very cagey indeed. It is important that we set limit values and that we do so in a sensible way, although we already have limit values set in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of nonylphenol, this is an aquatic pollutant, and although many in the committee tried to talk about health risks and bring in other factors, we must concentrate on the case at hand, which is making sure that nonylphenol does not reach water courses and is banned in applications where there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">We need exceptions and the problem of using nonylphenol ethoxylate as a co-formulant in pesticides is one that we addressed. The compromise is to allow existing pesticides to continue until the end of their licensing period, but it will be banned in new pesticides. Incidentally, we still allow them to be used in spermicides in condom production where there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we reached an agreement and avoided a second reading and possible conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowe (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would welcome this report and the work done in particular by the rapporteur and all the others concerned to reach a first reading agreement and therefore hasten the implementation of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly with regard to cement, we have made substantial progress. The problem has been recognised and identified across the whole of Europe. Cement is a major cause of eczema for all workers in occupations involving the regular use of cement. Various experiences and various construction projects utilising cement that has been ameliorated with ferrous sulphate have demonstrated that the sensible use of this cement makes a very substantial reduction in the number of incidents of eczema within the industry. It is clear that making this mandatory could bring considerable improvements for many workers across the whole of Europe. Whilst we have had to accept some compromises to reach a first reading agreement, we have reached a reasonable compromise, although we must continue to examine the problems associated with the use of cement in closed systems. In reality, I do not think I have ever seen a closed system myself in any factory anywhere where cement does not leak, squeeze or squirt out somewhere in the system and come into contact with workers on a fairly regular basis. We must continue to look at this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards nonylphenol ethoxylate, again we have made substantial progress – progress that I regret cannot result in an immediate implementation of complete controls on it. But the compromises we have reached are reasonable. Firstly, only where those uses are really inevitable, for example in the use of spermicides, have we allowed the continued use and we are still concerned to find appropriate and suitable alternatives; and secondly, where we have decided to end the use of these things, for example as a co-formulant in pesticides, we have given a reasonable phase-out time and reasonable opportunity for the industry to bring forward new formulations that are appropriate and efficacious for use without the use of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is again a reasonable compromise. Altogether, we can all commend this report to the House tomorrow morning and consider it a job well done, congratulate the rapporteur and look forward to early implementation of this proposal and a substantial saving in costs and compensation towards industrial injuries caused by cement and probably towards human health caused by nonylphenol ethoxylate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can readily agree with the proposal and the rapporteur with regard to the care that needs to be taken with nonylphenol and with nonylphenol ethoxylate, the dangers of which are well known and which cannot be addressed by any means other than a proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have serious reservations, however, about the need and the appropriateness of the directive on cement, on various grounds. Firstly, we believe it to be technically wrong and politically surprising that the same legislative text covers both unquestionably dangerous products and cement. Secondly, we believe that clearly insufficient time has elapsed since the implementation of directive 2001/60/EEC on labelling to be able to draw safe conclusions about its adequacy or otherwise in reducing or eliminating the most worrying cases in this field. Thirdly, the information available does not enable us to corroborate, with the apparent certainty that some Members have, a genuine and rigorous risk assessment of chromium VI, which, as we know, is still a cause for controversy amongst specialists.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, if these limitations are adopted, we feel that to some extent we will have accepted a form of discrimination which, by means of derogations, favours producers and the bulk cement trade over bagged cement. We are therefore opposed in particular to Amendments Nos 31, 32, 33, 34 and 43, and if these are adopted we shall, unfortunately, feel obliged to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
