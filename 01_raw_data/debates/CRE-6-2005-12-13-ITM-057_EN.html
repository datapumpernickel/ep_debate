<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Geoff Hoon, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I shall begin by thanking the European Parliament for proposing this timely debate on Tunisia. I would like to record our appreciation of Tunisia’s recent hosting of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society from 16 to 18 November. We welcome the summit’s agreement to the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, an important contribution to the global effort needed to bridge what is known as the digital divide.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is right for us to consider more generally the issues of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia. The Council shares the concerns of Members of this House about the human rights situation in Tunisia and is well aware of the shortcomings in Tunisia’s performance, particularly with respect to acts of intimidation and harassment by the authorities against civil society and human rights activists. The meeting convened on Thursday, 1 December, involving MEPs, certain committees and other EU institutions involved in the summit, specifically to discuss human rights concerns in Tunisia, further highlighted the importance of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights is an essential element in the EU’s relationship with Tunisia, as set out in the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, which came into force on 1 March 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan which came into force on 4 July this year. Under its action plan, Tunisia has signed up to commitments in the area of democracy, good governance and human rights. Implementing these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations. They include, for example, the establishment of an EU-Tunisia subcommittee on human rights. To this end we continue to urge the Tunisians to establish and hold a first session of a human rights subcommittee as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the EuroMed tenth anniversary summit on 27 and 28 November in Barcelona represented an important opportunity to help the EU’s Mediterranean partners, including Tunisia, to address the challenges of the 21st century, including in relation to good governance. At the EuroMed Summit, leaders endorsed an outcome-oriented five-year work plan. That plan included the creation of a governance facility to help those countries that make progress on good governance, allowing them access to additional funds to spend on their priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia is a state party to the six core United Nations human rights treaties. Tunisia scores well on most socio-economic indexes of multilateral institutions, and social and economic rights are recognised and protected. Tunisia plays an active role within international human rights institutions and was elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April 2004. Tunisia has not yet, however, signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU welcomes Tunisia’s record of promoting reform in the Arab world, notably on the position of women and the right to education. However, the EU remains concerned about the human rights situation in Tunisia, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and assembly and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has raised in particular the issue of the freedom of the press in Tunisia. All books and publications, with the exception of newspapers, are still subject to censorship. Until May 2005, all newspapers had to clear articles with the Ministry of the Interior in advance of publication. Whilst this is no longer the case, we remain concerned that the fear of reprisals appears to have resulted in some self-censorship, as no newspaper offers any political criticism or opinion on domestic issues contrary to the government’s view. Access to foreign television, however, is common, as most Tunisian households have access to satellite television.</p>
<p class="contents">As I already made clear, the EU welcomes the agreement on the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society reached at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis. The EU looks forward to working with all stakeholders to ensure the full and effective implementation of both stages of the summit process, both on substance and on follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were reported in the run-up to and during the summit itself. The Tunisian Human Rights League, the oldest human rights body in Tunisia, claimed police harassment of its activists and says that it has been prevented from functioning properly. A court decision in September 2005 postponed its Congress. The EU consequently made representations to the Tunisian authorities and issued a statement reminding the Tunisians of the EU’s expectations of its human rights responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">During the summit itself, the EU Troika made representations to the Tunisian authorities following an incident at the Goethe Institute, where NGOs were prevented from meeting to discuss plans for an alternative ‘Citizens’ Summit’.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also concerned about a number of other incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, also reported during the summit. These include the disruption of the activities of a Belgian TV crew, as well as the disruption of the European Commission workshop for MEPs to meet members of civil society in the summit’s conference centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia’s Constitution provides for freedom of association, but within certain defined limits. The law provides for freedom of assembly, as long as a permit is obtained from the Minister of Interior. However, some NGOs experience difficulties in renting space and the control of funding. A number of associations have applied for legal status and have been refused, for example the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia. NGOs also report that Internet access is routinely blocked and e-mails addressed to certain e-mail accounts never reach the intended recipient.</p>
<p class="contents">During the presidential campaign of October 2004, the electoral code prohibited Tunisians from discussing politics in the international press, and opposition parties were given little opportunity to campaign. Whilst recognising that the election law safeguards female representation in parliament as well as the representation of minority views, we noted that the overall process leading to the elections did not provide a level playing field for contenders. We therefore encourage the Tunisian authorities to continue to improve the framework for elections and to take the necessary steps to ensure that the next elections fully meet international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also concerned by reports from NGOs, including Amnesty International, about prison conditions in Tunisia. These reports state that overcrowding in prisons and discriminatory treatment of political prisoners continue as well as a lack of basic medical care, poor hygiene, torture and ill-treatment. We therefore welcome the fact that since June 2005 Tunisia’s authorities have allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, the Tunisian authorities announced their intention to allow Human Rights Watch representatives access to prisons in a similar way to that of the International Committee of the Red Cross, although no timeframe was specified. The Minister for Justice and Human Rights also announced that the practice of detaining prisoners in solitary confinement beyond 10 days, the maximum allowed under the Constitution, would cease. The EU welcomes these announcements and hopes that both undertakings will be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words about the judiciary in Tunisia. Under its Constitution, it is independent. However, Amnesty International and others report that the authorities interfere in the judicial process. The trial in April 2005 of a lawyer and member of the National Council for Civil Liberties in Tunisia, Mohamed Abou, who wrote an article criticising Tunisia’s President Ben Ali, seems to support this contention. The Tunisian Magistrates’ Association has complained of increased intimidation by the Government after its board issued a communiqué criticising the attack on Abou. The Public Prosecutor closed the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association’s office in August. A law passed on 12 August 2005 making provision for the statute of magistrates does not take into consideration earlier calls by the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association concerning terms and conditions of service and would appear to weaken its position. We also note that despite several requests to visit, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers has yet to receive an invitation from the Tunisian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU wishes to work with Tunisia to support the modernisation of its judiciary. The EU has provided money through MEDA to fund a project that will support this work and hopes to see progress on this. I am sure that the Commission will want to say something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the EU welcomes the agreements reached at the World Summit on the Information Society as an important contribution to the global effort to bridge the digital divide. In terms of the EU’s relationship with Tunisia itself, we wish to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and prosperity. We regret the serious restrictions on freedom of expression and association and the incidents which occurred prior to and during the World Summit on the Information Society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should like to assure honourable Members that the EU will continue to express its concern over specific human rights violations and to impress on the Tunisian authorities the need for full respect for human rights and democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali on democracy, good governance and human rights set out in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan. Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the situation of human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia. What brings me to Parliament today is a series of incidents that occurred at the recent World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, an event in which both Members of Parliament and the Commission were present.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I refer to those incidents with great regret, since we have to recognise that the host country made an enormous effort in organising the summit, which itself brought about a very positive outcome for the EU in the important field of the future of internet governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit outcome is a success for the EU and it bears the ‘made in Europe’ stamp. The active participation of the Commission and the continuous coordination of the position of the 25 Member States, together with the UK Presidency, since the June Telecom Council, had a positive impact on the final agreement. We managed to push through our ideas, showing that the Europe which speaks with one voice is a Europe that wins. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has spoken with one and the same voice throughout the negotiations and has exerted a real influence on the debates.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Internet governance, the results of the Summit bestow on the world an agreement that covers such crucial aspects as freedom of expression and of access to information, security, and the fight against spamming. As regards the key functions of the Internet, it has been decided, consistent with the proposals made by Europe, to create two fora and two processes. On the one hand, the Internet Governance Forum, already known by the acronym IGF and, on the other, the process organising enhanced cooperation between governments on the political principles related to Internet governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments have political responsibilities to fulfil. It is clear that they must not intervene either in the technical management of the Internet or in that of ICANN. The Commission is in favour of the Internet being managed by the private sector, as was demonstrated, for that matter, by the implementation of the ‘.eu’ domain.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the funding for combating the digital divide, an agreement has been finalised on the funding mechanisms, and priorities have been set in terms of promoting the importance of information and communication technologies in the context of the existing funding mechanisms. In other words, information and communication technologies will be an important tool in the future for our development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first quarter of 2006, the Commission will adopt a communication, the aim of which is to evaluate the results of the Summit and to show how the European policies will take account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2006, the United Nations intends to start a wide-ranging consultation with a view to the preparation of the Internet Governance Forum. We, for our part, will actively consult with industry, as we have done in the past, and I believe that the European Parliament will be in a position to take responsibility for a substantial part of the consultation of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enhanced cooperation between governments – the second process – Mr Annan wanted first of all to know what the intentions of the United States and the European Union were. I confirmed that it was our intention to prepare an initial position statement at European level by mid-February. Together with the Member States, we must now define the process that will enable political principles in relation to Internet governance and the transparent and responsible implementation of these principles to be attained. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, unfortunately, the summit was overshadowed by events that prompted the Commission to mark its strong disagreement as to the way the Tunisian authorities interfered with civil society events, creating difficulties even for the European Parliament-Commission Joint Workshop on Human Rights, not to mention the restrictions on expression experienced both before and during the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has already expressed our concerns to the Tunisian Government, and we have pointed out that it was difficult for us to believe that the incidents were just the result of an ‘unfortunate’ misunderstanding. We also explained that in the absence of positive reactions it will be more and more difficult for the Commission to continue its constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an EU demarche on human rights is being considered by Member States, and the Commission will participate fully. The intention is to express our regrets vis-à-vis the recent events and reiterate our demands of last October: first, to unblock EU-funded civil society projects; second, to make progress on the implementation of the judicial reform programme; and, third, to create a subcommittee on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction to the Tunis summit was brought up by President Barroso in his speech at the Barcelona summit. He expressed his deep regret at the attempts to stifle freedom of expression during the event. He stressed that ‘a society which cannot trust its own people is a weak and fragile one with little prospect of meaningful development’.</p>
<p class="contents">These demarches represent our first steps. We have asked for specific gestures from the Tunisian side. At the beginning of next year, we will re-evaluate the situation with Member States and decide, in the absence of progress, whether further measures should be taken. I should like firmly to reassure you that the European Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the provisions of the association agreement and of the EU-Tunisia Action Plan with regard to respect for human rights are duly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a new and more effective framework to tackle human rights questions: the neighbourhood policy. It is our firm intention, shared with the Council, to put the neighbourhood instruments at the service of improving the situation in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the good dialogue that we have had with Parliament on this issue. Our efforts in promoting democracy and respect for human rights in Tunisia will be all the more effective if we are able to send consistent and coherent messages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first country in its region to sign an association agreement with the EU. However, the conditions and events which surrounded the recent World Summit on the Information Society have significantly increased existing concerns relating to human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the build-up to the summit, advocates for freedom of expression and association in Tunisia experienced increased harassment. There are also reports of summit delegates being harassed, assaults on Tunisian and international journalists, denial of entry into the country, the monitoring and blocking of certain websites, the censorship of certain documents and speeches and the prevention and disruption of meetings. Even MEPs and representatives of the European Commission reportedly experienced intimidation and verbal aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">While we recognise that Tunisia faces a certain threat from extremist elements and is trying to deal with that threat, it must do so in a way that respects human rights standards and democratic standards. The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The enhanced cooperation of the Member States has enabled progress to be made with regard not only to the introduction of an Internet Governance Forum, which will meet for the first time in Athens, but also to the democratic balance between the Member States, to pluralism and to the involvement of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute the essential foundations of Internet governance and of the action plan. It is on the basis of the proposals made by the Union and, more specifically, by the Commission, that an agreement was reached in Tunis, not least with the United States. I should like to pay tribute to the Commission’s negotiators and to sincerely thank the Commissioner for having involved the European Parliament in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the only shadow cast over this Summit should have come from Tunisia itself. The serious incidents that surrounded the Summit and that undermined not only the freedom of the press and freedom of expression and of assembly, but also the people are, in my opinion, unacceptable, as are the events targeted at our delegation including, in particular, the sabotage of the Workshop on Human Rights in relation to Internet governance. They run counter to the commitments made by Tunisia in the Summit conclusions and in the Association Agreement, thus violating the reciprocal character of these commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">These events call for a swift and firm response from the Union, and I call on my fellow Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution, which demands that practical measures be taken immediately. I thank the Commissioner for the very precise remarks she made just now along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You acknowledged yourself, Commissioner, that the World Summit on the Information Society produced valuable results; it also had a spin-off, a focusing effect. It is not possible to accredit 30 000 people and hundreds of journalists without attracting the attention of public opinion. As Tunisia came under this spotlight, we became acutely aware of the imbalance that exists there between the treatment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the undeniable progress that Tunisia has been making in the fields of economic and social development, education and training and equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has long been monitoring these things, because Tunisia is a partner of ours and was one of the first countries to conclude an association agreement with us. In our opinion, its development has been exemplary, and we reiterate the wish expressed in our last resolution, adopted in September, that the development of respect for human rights should keep pace with the observable progress in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">All we are asking, in other words, is that Tunisia honour the contractual commitments it has made. It is not in our interests to hurl invective, nor would we wish to do so. We simply seek to guarantee instruments of dialogue, as Mrs Reding emphasised. We are prepared to help in the realm of justice through the MEDA programme; in the spirit of the resolution that will be adopted by our Parliament and on the basis of the values we seek to share, we want to have access to instruments of dialogue such as the Association Council and the Subcommittee on Human Rights, so as to ensure that our Tunisian partners are aware of the message – still a restrained message – that this House is about to convey to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes in the wake of the numerous violations of human rights that accompanied the World Summit on the Information Society which, as we know, took place in Tunis. Let me recall them briefly: human-rights activists and journalists were harassed, action was taken to prevent the convening of a citizens’ summit, telephone connections were cut off, e-mails and Internet access were blocked, the speech delivered by the President of Switzerland was censored, other international figures were deported, among them our Sakharov Prize winner Robert Ménard, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that these violations are not isolated, one-off occurrences but routine everyday practice in Tunisia. The human-rights situation in Tunisia is deteriorating – as we noted, by the way, in our resolution of 29 September. These latest incidents, I believe, are a direct challenge to the policy of the European Union on democracy and human rights in that country, which was the first signatory of an association agreement containing the famous Article 2, and we must rise to that challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has certainly made representations on several occasions, but it is truly regrettable that no public move has been made to denounce the violations of human rights that have taken place and to lend essential support to the incredible mobilisation of civil society, parts of which, incidentally, are represented today in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it important that the Commission and the Council undertake, firstly, to convene a meeting of the Association Council as soon as possible in order to discuss the human-rights situation and the practical consequences of the observed violations and, secondly, to initiate discussions, in the true spirit of the action plan, on a timetable of reforms in the areas already referred to, a precise timetable with deadlines for measurable results: result number one is the reform of the judicial system; in this context, we must demand the release of the lawyer Mohammed Abou and of all political prisoners in Tunisia as well as an end to the harassment of the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association; result number two is the removal of restrictions on the activities of civil society; number three is cooperation with UN mechanisms. These are the minimum requirements if we are to meet the challenge confronting us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as far as the Tunisian Government is concerned, I believe that the level of non-achievement is particularly significant and that very specific action has to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in fact seeing the symptoms of a virtual police state, where democratic rights and principles are denied. For months, European funds intended for the Tunisian League for Human Rights and other associations have been frozen. The defenders of human rights, whom I applaud today because they are here with us in Parliament, have described to us the political intimidation and physical threats to which they are subjected.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of the press, as we have seen at this latest conference, is non-existent and torture is practised in Tunisian jails. The opposition has no way of making its voice heard and all demands for democracy and reform are suppressed.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission, which has shown courage in its informal contacts, to do much more and take steps to have the EU-Tunisia Association Council convened without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The manifest aim of the resolution is to make an issue of minor incidents, and I do mean minor incidents, that occurred during the World Summit on the Information Society, a summit which took place in what we – and we are not alone in this – considered to be entirely satisfactory conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should Tunisia be hounded like this when so many states around the world with which the European Union has better relations and which, in some cases, it is preparing to welcome into the fold, display far less respect for fundamental freedoms than the Tunisian Government? Why Tunisia? The answer is simple. It is because Tunisia is succeeding only too well and, in the eyes of certain powers – and, alas, of some simple souls they manipulate – Tunisia poses a risk on three counts.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Tunisia is a model of development, and one wonders whether certain superpowers are not out to destroy any Arab country that is on the way to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Tunisia is a model of Mediterranean cooperation. It is no coincidence that it was the first country in that part of the world to sign an association agreement with the Union, and there are some who, in the name of the well-known theory of the clash of civilisations, might have an interest in setting one side of the Mediterranean against the other, given that unity in the Mediterranean region would allow the wider Euro-African area to prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Tunisia is a model of cooperation in the French-speaking world. French is the language of its development, but, as we saw at a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Rabat only a few days ago, some would prefer French to give way to English as the one and only international language.</p>
<p class="contents">By rallying round the systematic detractors of Tunisia, such as Mrs Flautre, and by attacking a country which, I repeat, has been exemplary, this House will convey the impression that it seeks, under cover of cooperation and respect for human rights, to harden positions on both sides, which will ultimately foster Islamic fundamentalism. This is what is currently happening in Iraq through the agency of the West – or, to be more precise, Washington and its accomplices – and it is a process which first Egypt then the Maghreb countries might experience too. Our involvement in that would not serve the interests of the European powers; on the contrary, it would expose our peoples to the effects of terrible divisions in our common maritime region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed I was also at the Geneva Summit and was able to follow the project through.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the regret expressed by Mrs Reding and my colleague Mrs Trautmann about what I regarded as the entirely unnecessary disruption of our meetings in a country that clearly has embraced many aspects of the digital revolution, as the previous speaker said. I could not understand why it was felt necessary to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to concentrate on some of the achievements of the summit and, in particular, the policy that I called for after the Geneva Summit, which relates to how we can spread the capacity for computer science and research to the developing world so that they can develop their own products. We in the European Union have been hugely successful in the way that we have offered the benefits of our own networking technology through spreading the Géant Network to the developing world and also encouraging the development of open competitive markets to deliver high-quality services at competitive cost. That is a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">It was sad that, even so, this was a workshop full of professors and university researchers where the Tunisians chose to restrict attendance. It was unnecessary and took the shine off it. I admire Mrs Trautmann for the robust way in which she stood up to the interventions at our meeting.

<p class="contents">When I questioned the Commission and the Council on my return from a mission to Tunisia, I was indeed astonished at the timidity of their responses to what can only be described as a violation of the partnership agreement between the European Union and Tunisia, at least of the clauses relating to human rights. I trust that this timidity is not directly linked to other objectives, such as the organisation by the Maghreb countries, as some would wish, of a kind of policing system for our borders to curb illegal immigration. I am nevertheless pleased with the statements I have heard today, especially those from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond these statements and the resolution we must surely adopt on this subject, I hope that we shall have the opportunity to see the establishment and rapid adoption of specific mechanisms in the form of an Association Council and a Subcommittee on Human Rights.

First and foremost, an assessment of what happened: this was a summit focusing on the issue of a knowledge-based society, debating how new technology and services can be used to develop a high-technology society that seeks to spread greater freedom, give opportunities to all and ensure access to information and knowledge – just look at the computer designed for the so-called developing world – and to expand areas of freedom. With a summit of this sort and goals of this nature, the events in Tunis appear even more discordant, more unpleasant and more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">In the middle of a discussion on ways of increasing freedom and respect for rights, we actually found ourselves facing behaviour that clearly curtailed freedom, showed intolerance and prevented debate. That was a serious matter. We ask the Commission and Council – which have already done so – to take a firm stand against what occurred, and point out that our association agreement with Tunisia also includes a section on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to give my assessment of the negotiations and the next phase. Commissioner, we believe that significant progress was made, thanks to the role played by Europe, but we ask – and believe – that more should be done in relation to the commitments given and the forum to be held in Athens. We must be increasingly aware that Internet governance also requires Europe to find greater strength and cohesion in order to resist – if I may use the term – or in any event to respond in a positive manner to those who are today in dominant positions and try to trample on our European notion of balanced development and pluralist governance, with its respect for diversity, which, even in societies based on knowledge and technology, allows democratic principles to prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that Tunisia has a secure constitution. Women have rights to possess, inherit, vote and divorce. Islam belongs to everyone and cannot be used as a political monopoly for one political party. We all know that on the occasion of the World Summit on the Information Society, journalists, defenders of human rights and lawyers were intimidated and heavily beaten by security forces. We all know about President Ben Ali’s long and complicated struggle with An-Nahda – an extremist, radical, pro-terrorist movement which combines its influence with the far left and quite clearly threatens the regime and democracy in Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we should use this opportunity to send a clear message not only to President Ali, but to many other rulers in the Middle East. We must firmly support every possible means to struggle and fight against Islamic radicalism, extremism and abuse of power to explain and present the general truth to everyone. But we must not allow friendly countries, friendly presidents and friendly regimes to misuse our support to wipe out, kill and destroy a diverse, democratic and secular opposition.</p>

No respect should be paid to undemocratic practices in which human rights are abused, particularly the right of freedom of expression and criticism, the freedom to gather and to obtain information. We cannot deal with the threat of terrorism, with abuse of the right to explain the truth to everyone and with frustration until we say very clearly that every man and woman should be free to express himself or herself clearly, openly and democratically, be they Tunisian, European journalists or Tunisian human rights activists or lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">State monopolies on newspapers, state monopolies on financing all newspapers, radio and TV channels clearly contradict what we call the ‘information society’. This should be our friendly message to our friend President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, we socialists believe that, with regard to a country that has undoubtedly made impressive advances in the socio-economic sphere, it is important to welcome a veritable democratic outcry on the part of the trade unions, the human-rights organisations, the judicial authorities and lawyers. The momentum they have generated can surely lead to the realisation of freedom of expression, association and assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">This renewal is epitomised by the 18 October Movement and its intention to set up a permanent forum, with which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wish to be associated. It has often been said that the Barcelona process was a partial failure, and it is true that we were timorous. Europe is struggling to propagate its ideal of democratic pluralism. In this respect, Tunisia is a gift to us, almost a model. The Tunisians are not calling for our help, but they do want more democracy. Can we support these people who have been striving, and sometimes waging fierce struggles – as social struggles always are – to open up and relax a regime that tends to close in on itself, a regime which, in the name of the fight against terrorism, stigmatises all defenders of human rights and prevents judges, prosecutors and lawyers from holding meetings and forming associations? Can we fight to ensure that no socialist regime is able to invoke its membership of the Socialist International in order to trample on human rights?</p>
<p class="contents">I have only one request: that the issue of human rights and the rule of law in Tunisia play a key role in the deliberations of the Association Council which is due to meet in January 2006 and that no one beat about the bush. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is the key: the key question and the key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Tunisia is not just any case. A few days ago we expressed our regret — as has already been said — that, in the assessment of the Barcelona Conference on the Euro-Mediterranean process, insufficient progress has been made in terms of moving forward on the construction of a European area of respect for human rights and promotion of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Tunisia, we are not dealing with an absence of civil society. The problem is that civil society is not being allowed to express itself with complete freedom. And to me this is the fundamental aspect. If the European Union wants its message, its debate and its Euro-Mediterranean policy to be coherent, it should not send out the message that the situations we have witnessed over recent days are being ignored, in particular during the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia and the arrests of several leaders of human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">To me, therefore, coherence is a fundamental issue which we must not leave out of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity. We welcome Tunisia’s record of promoting economic and social reform, notably on the position of women and the right to education, but we need to continue to work with Tunisia on a number of human rights issues and see progress made, particularly in the areas of the right to expression and association. We will continue to work with the Tunisian authorities to implement the commitments on democracy, good governance and human rights that it signed up to in its European neighbourhood policy action plan. As I made clear earlier, implementing those commitments will be an important element in developing EU-Tunisia relations.</p>

It must be recognised, as some Members have said, that economic and social reforms have been a Tunisian success story, but there is also a need for Tunisians to rise to the challenge of a trailblazing role in the field of human rights, and there is still a long way to go on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association Committee will meet at the start of next year. A meeting of the Association Council will follow, and we fully intend to put human-rights problems on the agenda. As for the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Tunisia has accepted its creation. Informal agreement has been reached on all points other than the individual cases, and I believe this is important in the light of the discussion we have had. Following the debates that are currently taking place within the Council, we shall make a formal proposal to Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank all the European Members of Parliament who have demonstrated their solidarity with all those in the Council, the Commission and Parliament who are committed to ensuring that human rights and freedom of expression become a reality and not a political football for the governments of this world.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the very deplorable events that occurred in Tunis with regard to human rights, the summit had a gratifying outcome. In future, the two processes – the stakeholders’ forum and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation – will enable us at any time to put on the agenda issues relating to the freedom that can emanate from information and communication technology and to make that freedom a reality in every country of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A fundamental premise of this cooperation is respect for human rights, as enshrined in the EU-Tunisia Agreement, which entered into force in 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan inaugurated this year. The Tunisian Government has always shown itself to be particularly open and willing to accept its commitments towards the international community in the field of human rights, democracy and governance, as shown by the recent establishment of the EU-Tunisia Human Rights Subcommittee and the country’s willingness to agree to organise the World Summit on the Information Society. Tunisia is actively party to the six main United Nations treaties and, compared with other Arab countries, it makes a point of maintaining a secular state and of protecting its citizens’ social and economic rights. Greater efforts are, of course, still needed to achieve a level of freedom worthy of a fully democratic country – episodes like those that have just occurred are proof of that – but we must in any event acknowledge the efforts and the progress made so far and assure Tunisia that it has our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
