<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Chrysoula Paliadeli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, the idea for the European Heritage Label was initially tabled in 2005 as a transnational initiative designed to highlight sites connected with European history, the creation and role of the European Union, and the values on which it was founded.</p>
<p class="contents">In that particular form, the European Heritage Label has been awarded to date to 64 sites in Member States of the European Union and Switzerland. These sites reflect a broad spectrum of symbolic concepts illustrating intangible values and material cultural monuments to our common European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2008, the European Council expressed the intention of making the label an official EU action. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of the European Heritage Label, in its European form, would be completed under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission text was communicated to the European Parliament in March 2010. A few days later, I was appointed to draft the relevant report, which was adopted by a large majority here in Strasbourg a year ago, marking the start last December of negotiations with the other European institutions to create the final legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this long but very constructive process, which was supported by excellent cooperation on the part of the Commission and Council representatives and clear guidance from the chair of the Committee on Culture and Education and, of course, excellent cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs, is the legislative act that will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like, as I stand here, to thank everyone who participated in this joint effort to create a broadly targeted label based on clear-cut criteria, a more rational approach and, most importantly, continuous evaluation compared with the previous transnational label. This conversion from an intergovernmental procedure to a European action was no easy task. We needed to deal with the old label respectfully, but critically, in order to give due weight to the new label, to ensure its viability, and to guarantee clear criteria, transparent selection procedures and its regular application.</p>
<p class="contents">We started by accepting the symbolism of this action as the most important criterion; in other words, the sites to be labelled would be selected not for their beauty, but as three-dimensional reflections of the ideas and values on which European civilisation is based and the European Union was created. Our basic requirement was the educational value of the sites labelled to the young generation, the networking of sites and their attraction to tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issues that concerned us were: a possible change of name, so that it clearly declared its identity as an EU action; unfortunately, this was not accepted by the Committee on Culture at the initial stage and the name of the old intergovernmental label was therefore retained. However, we made important changes to the Commission text and here I owe a great deal to my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and to the constant exchange of views with the Commission and Council representatives at the two official meetings and in numerous informal meetings held in support of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we secured the participation of the European Parliament on an equal footing in the panel of experts which was set up. Secondly, the European Parliament was kept informed by the European Commission at every stage of the procedure to apply this action. Thirdly, there will be complete transparency at all stages of the action, from the initial selection at national level, with the facility for Member States to contest selections that affect vital priorities and the facility to withdraw the label from sites that no longer meet the criteria for the label.</p>
<p class="contents">We amended the frequency of selection by States from every year to every two years, added one member to the panel of experts, so that the Committee of the Regions would be represented during selection and designation and, finally, we managed to postpone the widening of the scope of the action to other countries until after its first evaluation, because we felt that we wanted the European Heritage Label to become a well-established action which could then be used beyond the borders of the European Union and the European continent as an instrument for peaceful foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We supported the acceptance of thematic sites in order to encourage cooperation at national, regional and transnational level, using networking as the instrument and again setting maximum possible cohesion at European level as the objective.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, this proposal was one of the very first to be adopted by the new Commission just after it took office, and it is one of our priorities in the field of culture for the years to come. Through this label, our aim is to give European citizens, especially young people, new opportunities to learn about our common yet diverse cultural heritage and about the history and the building of the European Union. I strongly believe that this will contribute to bringing European citizens closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Heritage Label will also help to increase cultural tourism, bringing economic benefits as well. The Commission is firmly convinced that the compromise that was reached is very positive for the three institutions, and that it is fully in line with the ambitions we all share for the Europe Heritage Label. This compromise will ensure the quality and the prestige of the label, which are absolutely primordial for the long-term success of the action.</p>
<p class="contents">We also appreciate that the rules and procedures were kept as clear, light and flexible as possible so that they can be easily understood by all European citizens and easily implemented by the Member States and by the European Union. I would therefore like to thank Parliament once again for the excellent cooperation we had on this file. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Heritage Label was originally an intergovernmental initiative that was already testament to Europe’s cultural roots. Which sites were labelled? The Acropolis in Athens, the cradle of humanity’s first democracy. The Cluny Abbey, at the crossroads of Romanic civilisation, which saw the birth of European humanism. The Gdańsk shipyards, stronghold of the Solidarność union, whose courage changed the face of Europe. The house of Robert Schuman, a political visionary and founding father of the European Union. All are so many places where one can see our common history and the values that we defend together.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will vote to turn this intergovernmental initiative into a Community project, to enhance the credibility, profile and prestige of this label by establishing transparent and rigorous selection criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you to Chrysoula Paliadeli and the spirit of openness she has shown to defend a quality label awarded every other year, which encourages cooperation in promoting transnational sites, has an independent panel of experts fairly appointed by the institutions, and which finally does not reward a site’s beauty or architectural quality but its symbolic value for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We wrongly attribute to Jean Monnet, Europe’s founding father, the quote ‘If we had to do it again, I would start with culture’. The success of this formula is based on the idea that our Union was first economic, then political, but has never been cultural. Nonetheless, Europe was a community of painters, philosophers, artists and writers well before the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) or the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about creating an artificial European culture but rather about recognising the heritage we share. The European Heritage Label is an essential initiative to promoting a cultural Europe because it enables it to be recognised, taught and be influential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it was timed for 22.00, of course, which is perhaps rather detrimental. Perhaps we might occasionally replace a debate on economics with a debate on culture sometime in the morning – but let’s get back to business.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this initiative, of course, since it is unique and differs from the Unesco World Heritage List and the Council of Europe’s European Cultural Routes initiative. I consider it important, because it can strengthen local and regional identity, as well as European integration. The label should promote the common cultural heritage of the Member States while respecting national and regional diversity and supporting the cultural diversity of territories. It is important for citizens to learn about Europe and to value the monuments and know-how of individual regions and towns, thus strengthening the shared sense of belonging to the EU. The label can also make European cities and regions more attractive, thus supporting growth and employment at local and regional level. I also welcome the fact that it is not really about protecting localities as such, but rather about how these monuments can offer an educational dimension for young people in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is, of course, important that we cover such an intergovernmental initiative with a European label and that we cover it with an EU label. There is no reason for us not to do this. It is an excellent and viable project, and the EU has an interest in it. Cooperation and support for culture in these difficult times for almost no cost at all is an opportunity that must be exploited. Support for education concerning culture – concerning that which is beautiful in us – is important for the forming of future generations, and the protection of these monuments is therefore in our interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document is not a bad one, it is not something to which we are strongly opposed or which we reject as a matter of policy. However, it is one of those documents which was not really necessary. I think that with regard to such documents, one could follow the advice of a certain philosopher which says that we should eliminate unnecessary entities – and I have the feeling that this document is just such an unnecessary entity and that perhaps, in our capacity as politicians or as the European Union, we ought not to be working on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not fully convinced, as the Commissioner and Ms Neveďalová are, that introducing the European Heritage Label will, in fact, stimulate the economy and tourism. I do not see such a direct connection and I fear that the money which will be invested in this project – all those panel members of whom the rapporteur spoke, all the experts who will have to be used for this – will be financed from the budget, from the taxpayer’s pocket, but that this will not necessarily make things better for the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see Mr Borys in the Chamber, I can see Mr Scurria, I can see Mr Tőkés and Ms Neveďalová – and I value their work in the Committee on Culture and Education – and I think that in this vote, you are going to be able to get by without the votes of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. The ECR Group will abstain from voting on this precisely because we do not want to be hypocritical in supporting something which we think is unnecessary, which will be costly to taxpayers, and which, in my opinion, will not necessarily help – as it is supposed to do – enhance a sense of shared European identity. Let that European identity be built, but not necessarily with the help of politicians, not necessarily with the help of the European Union institutions.

Culture is here viewed as an instrument to, in the words of the rapporteur, ‘strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the European Union’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us talk, then, about culture in the European Union and let us talk about the scars that the European Union’s policies are leaving on culture. Let us talk, specifically, about the so-called financial bailout programmes of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund; programmes of veritable aggression; aggression against democratic values, against social and labour rights, and against culture too. It is the heritage being neglected; it is the penury budgets; it is the restrictions on the free creation and enjoyment of culture; it is the closure of schools; it is the increased prices of museums and cultural attractions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context – largely, I cannot fail to point out, imposed by the European Union – that this report is being debated. We are talking about making efforts, on the basis of a symbolic cultural dimension, to legitimise integration whose direction is, unfortunately, ever more against the interests and legitimate aspirations of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative cannot, therefore, be separated from the intense ideological struggle, naturally linked to the extremely lively social struggle taking place throughout the European Union. This attempt will achieve little in this context, let me tell you.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to raise another concern. Heritage is a sensitive area, because it cannot be separated from history. Let us hope this will not be yet another opening for the worrying and shameful processes of rewriting history that we have been witnessing in various countries over the last few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives. It is just desperate propaganda from an organisation to which more and more people do not wish to belong. I urge all MEPs who are proud of the heritage of their own nations to vote for my group’s rejection amendment tomorrow.

It is a crisis that threatens Europe with the menace of becoming spiritually empty and worn out. Globalism or, to use a slang word, ‘multi-culti,’ is stripping away and destroying all national and traditional cultural values, and leaves behind a great emptiness, a great void. In such times, any award or event that guides people, the European people, and youths back to healthy, normal Christian values, anything that leads European people back to nation, family and God, and gives youths a purpose and prepares them for the hardships of life is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">What I request is that the European Heritage Label not be an abstract award or an abstract concept, but be brought close to the people. I absolutely agree that it should indeed be used for job creation, but it is quite ambivalent to mention culture, tourism and the economy together, while the European Union is ordering Hungary to cut down the vines of some of its historic vine regions, or its apple plantations. So please set these misunderstandings right. It is high time that the European Union give sufficient room for a healthy diversity of nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Contrary to what was has been said of late, I am very convinced by this provision – because we can have different ideas and between us we can think things that are clearly different, but if we are here, we are here because we believe in the European Union and we believe in certain values that the Union has established and has seen emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">These values are the fruits of a common history created by so many individual components in our own nations, in our own cities and in our own lands, but which have then shaped a common civilisation, history, identity and tradition. There is no need to rewrite history to say that Gdańsk was the gateway to the liberty and democracy of a large part of Europe. There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are part of the same continent and we do all share a history. That is what this label is seeking to celebrate.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly welcome the European Heritage Label. I think it is an excellent initiative. I think it will be good because it will bring economic benefits. There is little doubt that it will increase tourism, and it will also be good because it will provide an educational focus for those who wish to take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the European Heritage Label as something to celebrate in these bleak economic times when things in Europe are not as good as they have been, something we can get on with and enjoy and see for the good of us all. It is about time that we viewed this in this spirit. It is a good initiative, a joyful initiative and something which we can all take part in. I would hope that those in other groups who do not see it like this will actually change their minds and go out and sell this concept to the rest of the European Union, to the rest of Europe, and indeed to the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe today, we face many problems, these problems divide us and it is increasingly difficult for us to agree on numerous matters, such as the budget or the common agricultural policy. No matter which of these important problems comes up, it causes controversies which are difficult to settle.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, something which can unite us is of great value, and the matter of cultural heritage may be one such thing, if we are going to seek agreement sensibly on this issue. I think the fundamental thing is a judicious coupling of European heritage with national heritage, and this very often means religious heritage, so as not to create conflicts of interest between European and national heritage. The results of this might be interesting and could be beneficial to Europe at this very difficult time. I imagine, for example, that a city in my region – Łódź – could serve as such a symbol, as its history and development have been shaped by people of different nationalities – not just Poles, but also Germans, Jews and even Russians. Showing such examples of European heritage should be good for the future of Europe. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance of the European Heritage Label, to pick up where Mr Scurria left off, is dual and two-way. It highlights diversity in Europe and, at the same time, reinforces the feeling that we live and share common historic monuments and common memories. However, it has an important added value when designed, mainly for the benefit of young citizens, to cultivate a common European conscience, the perception that Europe is an entity with different foundations but identical reference points.</p>
<p class="contents">There are bright spots in European history; however, there are also points of which we are not proud but which, nonetheless, form part of it. Besides, the lessons from these historic errors were, to a decisive degree, what inspired and shaped the present European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The label does, of course, offer a unique opportunity to become more outward-looking from a cultural point of view, to highlight our history and culture to the rest of the world, to utilise monuments that, when we visit them, make us wonder in sadness why they have not received the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the broader benefits, I think that there can be no doubt whatsoever that the label helps to increase cultural tourism, bringing economic as well as other benefits. We should not forget that, especially at this time, at this time of crisis, at a time when the main objective is economic growth, culture can, I repeat, provide an important answer. It already accounts for 3% of European GDP and has the potential to account for much more. I am certain that, if we all make a positive contribution, the European Heritage Label will also make a positive contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we do really want to return to our shared European heritage, then let us say boldly that it was, to a large extent, a Christian heritage. I am very glad about the voices in Parliament which say we have much in common, but it was also in this Parliament that very many people did not want the preamble to the European Constitution, which contained a reference to the Christian heritage of our continent, or what we call the ‘old’ continent. There is a certain hypocrisy in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome initiatives of this kind, by means of which young generations of Polish, French and German Europeans – Europeans of course, but not Europeans as such – can be shown their past.

<p class="contents">At a time when the events of the crisis are making it clear to more and more people that no individual national state can meet the current challenges and problems on its own, Europe is sending out a clear signal with the European Heritage Label, which will increase European citizens’ sense of belonging to the European Union and which clearly focuses on young people and on those critics who are still not convinced of the value of Europe in their own lives.</p>
<p class="contents">All the Member States must nominate two sites for the European Heritage Label which have played a key role in European integration. Values such as democracy, human rights, intercultural dialogue and the social market economy lie at the heart of our culture and our history and form part of our everyday lives. To give a better understanding of these values, I would like to mention two examples from my native country. One is the home of Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna, where he completed his ninth symphony, from which the European anthem is taken. The second is the place on the border with Hungary where the Austrian foreign minister, Alois Mock, cut the barbed wire which formed the Iron Curtain together with his Hungarian counterpart, Gyula Horn, and ended the decades of separation between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>

Making the common cultural and Christian heritage of Europeans visible, and emphasising common European values from the perspective of history and culture, gives the Union a new dimension which is closely connected with an enhanced sense of mutual belonging.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of the EU and its basic values depends on the extent to which its citizens and civil society get involved in long-term ideas about Europe as a single unit in terms of culture and values. In a time of material crisis of an economic or financial nature, when society needs to mobilise and adopt fundamental decisions on the direction it will take, it is particularly important to develop a cultural dialogue and increase the sense of shared ownership of the EU among our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The future vision of the EU is based on shared fundamental values. The European Heritage Label can therefore reflect and promote values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity. In my opinion, special attention should also be paid to the fight against racism and xenophobia when awarding the label.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express the conviction that through this label, we can help to spread knowledge about culture and history and therefore to bring about a flowering of the cultures of Member States and greater understanding between the citizens and nations of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union should give particular distinction to sites which have played a key role in European history. I fully agree with the idea that the symbolic value and educational dimension of a site should determine its inclusion as part of the European cultural heritage. In Poland, the label has been given to sites such as the Gdańsk Shipyards and the Cathedral of Saint Wenceslas and Saint Stanislas on Wawel Hill in Kraków, and in France to Robert Schuman’s House.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria proposed by the European Parliament for awarding the label streamline the selection process from the technical point of view. It is good that the number of proposals from each Member State is limited to two and that there is a procedure for monitoring and upholding proportionality in the selection of sites. Growth in prestige of the label is also exceptionally advantageous from the point of view of European cultural tourism, which is very fashionable today and much in demand, and it is also associated with economic advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Heritage Label will be an important factor in promotion and will also give rise to a forum for cooperation between labelled sites. I am counting on and believe in the success of this undertaking. I think that in the long-term perspective, it will help to enhance the shared European identity. I hope the label will contribute to a better knowledge of the history of our countries and nations. Sites which have been given the label can become an extremely important tool for education about history. It is important that they be places for meetings, discussions and dialogue and that they be full of life. Europeans today, as never before, need to draw on the traditions of our continent – Europe was built on Judaeo-Christian foundations, and these became, and were for centuries, the basis of the continent’s cultural strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The spirit of the label would strengthen our values and our sense of belonging to the EU. By acknowledging diversity, we still strengthen intercultural dialogue. To emphasise this is particularly important for all of us. By laying down criteria for the selection of sites, and through the scope of the geographic criteria and clear and simplified provisions, we are taking steps towards citizens that must meet high expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to finally transform this intergovernmental initiative into an official EU action. Objects that can be grouped on the basis of a specific theme and can apply together for the label represent an opening up towards young people compared to other initiatives in the field of cultural heritage.

Founded in 1871 and opened in 1890, this library was described in the reports of that time as an intellectual repository for society, required for good administration. The site of the ‘V.A. Urechia’ Library was the first headquarters of the European Danube Commission, which began its activities in 1856 in Galaţi, tasked with ensuring freedom of navigation on the Danube. The European Council adopted the European Union strategy for the Danube Region 155 years after this Commission was founded, in recognition of the importance of the Danube Region to the EU’s past, present, future and cohesion. V.A. Urechia said that the strongest fortress is that in which citizens defend themselves with learning and science.

Not only principles and European history, but also mutual understanding are elements which produce added value for the EU. The label initiative is focused on promoting designated sites, spreading information and increasing public access to them. We are therefore acknowledging that the project has not enjoyed the high profile it deserved during the intergovernmental phase. I welcome the agreement that has been reached with the Council, especially to simplify and clarify transitional procedures. I also feel that the issue of transnational sites is significant to the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we need to consider in the future providing access to this project for the European countries which are not yet part of the European Union, and I provide as an argument for this a symbolic EU initiative: Sibiu was designated as a European Capital of Culture when Romania’s accession to the EU was not certain. This designation was a real European success.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Heritage Label will undoubtedly raise our citizens’ awareness of the diversity of our common history and will boost cultural tourism. I wish to congratulate Ms Paliadeli and the Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The participation in the use of the label is to be voluntary for countries, and each of the participating countries is to have the right, every two years, to propose up to two localities to a group of independent experts, from which a jury will select one locality from each state that will get the European Heritage label.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the fact that the European Commission is now thinking about the symbolic labelling of localities that are linked to the development of the EU in a significant way, to make real for young people the processes and events that had a formative effect on the Union. However, the initiative must be implemented very sensitively and unobtrusively, especially in the present period when, as a result of economic problems, citizens in many countries see the Union rather as an insensitive dictator. The time has not yet come for the citizens themselves to judge whether or not the Union is really helping them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that today, we will reach a compromise with the Council, because during a crisis, we should talk about culture and our identity with even greater emphasis, and in contrast to what Ms Sinclaire has just said, we should learn lessons from history, which means that the European Heritage Label initiative should talk boldly about what was good and what was bad in Europe so that similar tragedies cannot be repeated in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Which is why it seems to me that the eminent Polish philosopher, Zygmunt Bauman, is correct here in saying that in the whole construction of Europe, the most important matter is that Europe is the sum of cultural horizons from which we can learn lessons because, after all, we are all each other’s neighbour. If we want to achieve benefits in the economy, education or tourism, based on the example of UNESCO, for example, we should learn the lesson of Mr Migalski’s words that this label and this initiative must be implemented properly and professionally, and that it must not be another unsuccessful or fairly successful initiative. So this is why I would like to appeal strongly to Ms Vassiliou for the cultural heritage label to be prepared in a truly professional way, so that in all the clamour for attention, it will be able to capture the imagination of all Europeans and achieve the right objective.

At the same time, the European Heritage Label harmonises environmental protection measures in the areas where the cultural sites are located.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to incorporate in the programme the historical monuments of the EU, around which present-day Europe has been created. I welcome the promotion of sites with a cross-border aspect. At a regional level, they have provided the foundation for European integration.

I have listened very carefully to my colleagues’ speeches, including under the catch-the-eye procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">May I therefore say that, as regards individual questions, the final text that we adopt will take account of the concern about cross-border cooperation and transparency and will take account of the concern of those who question whether we should, in fact, have such a label at these difficult times for Europe or if it should be seen as a luxury.</p>
<p class="contents">However, culture is not a luxury; the application of the label should not be funded from European money over and above the small amount needed, mainly to cover bureaucratic and administrative requirements. On the contrary, local communities will be asked to fund their own participation in the action, meaning that it will galvanise local communities, and not only with a view to highlighting their local sites.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall reward cooperation and that will support cohesion at national, regional and European level. Of course, one of the objectives is to widen the application of this action to countries that are due to become members of the European Union and to third countries that belong to the European continent and to countries outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we felt that the trial period for this action should be limited initially to the 27 Member States of the Union. In four years, following the first evaluation, we shall see if we can widen it further. I believe that one of the reasons we have reached this economic crisis and a crisis in values is precisely because of the reduced importance the European Union has attached to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the right instrument and that we should use it to regain the Europe of those who envisaged it not just as an economic union in difficulty, but as a cultural union. I therefore take the view that culture is perhaps the only instrument that can make a positive contribution in reversing this massive crisis we are living in, which will not, I trust, take us into worse times.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks to Ms Vassiliou, my thanks to my colleagues, my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and, of course, to the Commission, for giving us the initial text, and to the Council for its assent over the months during which we cooperated, so that we could find compromise solutions to issues on which we differed.

Based on an intergovernmental initiative which has proved successful, the European Heritage Label has all the requirements also to continue in the same vein when it becomes an EU programme, not to mention that it also benefits from the experience acquired through other similar programmes, the most notable being the European Capital of Culture, which has an unquestionable impact.</p>

While the historical experiences of our nations may differ, we are all Europeans with the same fundamental values. It is important that we pay tribute to the events, people and places in our common past which have helped us to develop this unique union. Our unity in diversity is what makes us strong, and a common understanding of our neighbours and ourselves can only strengthen this bond. Places such as Athens, the birthplace of democracy, or events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 Baltic Way, where, in spite of overwhelming force, people demanded freedom and the reunification of Europe, connect us all. Commemoration not only helps Europe understand its common past and destiny; it also helps to highlight the common goals and common values of our nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To ensure that these principles also work in practice, it is important as well for Europe’s different nations to have mutual knowledge of each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I should mention the success enjoyed, for instance, by other programmes with similar objectives, such as the European Capital of Culture (the city which I represent, Cluj-Napoca, is actually a candidate to become a Capital of Culture in 2020). Based on the experience from these programmes, we can be confident that the European Heritage Label will also be a successful initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
