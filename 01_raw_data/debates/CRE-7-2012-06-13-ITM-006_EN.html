<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, the European Council meeting on 28 and 29 June is due to take important decisions on measures to help stimulate economic growth and employment. This is a key element of our overall strategy to ensure that Europe emerges from the current situation with increased growth and a stronger economic basis. To put it very simply, Europe needs growth and Europe needs jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal meeting of Heads of State on 23 May, as well as the informal General Affairs Council meeting on 10 and 11 June, paved the way for the preparation of a comprehensive package of measures as part of the growth initiative for Europe. I would like to point to some of the various elements that can be included in this package.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic policy, job creation is a priority for all of us. Growth is not enough in itself. It must lead to new jobs and we need to do more. The Council welcomes the Commission’s employment package, which certainly contains many interesting ideas, not least to promote youth employment and labour mobility. Let me also give a couple of concrete examples of how some of the proposals already on the table can boost employment. First, adoption of the energy efficiency directive can create up to 400 000 new jobs. Second, new trade agreements with third countries may create about two million new jobs, and a reform of the single market will create even more millions of jobs. As you know, there are roughly the same number of unemployed people across Europe as we have small and medium-sized enterprises. If we could only create one more job in each of these SMEs, we would have taken a giant step towards addressing the unemployment issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has been committed to making progress on all legislative files which have the potential to deliver growth and employment. On a number of dossiers, we have advanced well and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for a very constructive partnership with the Presidency on this agenda. This applies, for instance, to the case of roaming regulation and standardisation, where the Council has been able to reach agreement with the European Parliament. We are also on track on issues such as venture capital and social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">The June European Council will also conclude the European Semester through the endorsement of country-specific recommendations set out by the Commission in its proposal of 30 May. Our objective is to guide Member States in their structural reforms, employment policies and national budgets with the overall aim of ensuring that fiscal consolidation and growth go hand in hand. I would like to thank Parliament for the way in which it has offered strong support for the growth and employment agenda, as its motions for resolutions confirm.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to step up efforts to boost the financing of the economy. I am very pleased that the Council and Parliament were able to agree on the project bond pilot phase which will start this summer. The Commission has also proposed a EUR 10 billion increase in paid-in capital to the EIB as part of a new EU growth initiative. Furthermore, efforts should be made regarding better targeting of Structural Funds to foster growth and convergence. The Commission will report on this issue later this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key element to our growth agenda is external economic policy. The European Council will discuss how the Union can better use a trade and investment relationship with key partners as an engine for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major item on the June European Council agenda is the multiannual financial framework (MFF). As you know, the MFF package is a top priority for us and, from the very beginning of our Presidency, we have been aiming to make as much progress as possible on this dossier. We based our work on the mandate given to us by the December 2011 European Council, and that is to press ahead with the work aimed at developing a basis for the final stage of negotiations to be discussed at the June European Council. We have taken this mandate very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">While the aim of the Presidency has not been to reach a final compromise on this package, all our efforts are directed towards preparing the ground for a first serious and substantial discussion in June and delivering a fully integrated negotiating box containing all the elements for the final agreement, which should help lead to the adoption of the MFF at the end of this year. The MFF dossier constitutes a great opportunity to make the EU budget respond better to today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and needs. It is also essential that the next MFF is fully geared towards growth and job-enhancing policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In putting the box together, we have listened carefully to delegations in Council meetings. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament’s representatives who have taken part in our work. We have excellent cooperation with the representatives of Parliament, and before every meeting at which the MFF has been on the agenda, we have met with Parliament’s representatives, we have told Ministers what Parliament’s views are and we have also met afterwards. It is also important to stress – and I want to make this very clear – that we must, of course, all follow the legislative procedures laid down in the Treaty, including with regard to codecision. It is also important to say that there is no final deal before there is agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure further progress in the MFF negotiations, thereby fulfilling the mandate given by the European Council in December, the Presidency has put forward a proposal regarding the structure of the budget, including the placement of instruments that the Commission has proposed to place outside the MFF. It is very important for me to say today that this proposal on the structure of the MFF only relates to the placement of instruments. It does not in any way prejudge the size of the budget or decision-making procedures for those instruments, nor does it prejudge the expenditure level for the headings in which some of those instruments are included. Therefore, the Presidency’s proposal does not entail a reduction in the budget or in the degree of flexibility in the Commission’s proposal. The point of departure for the Presidency is that the proposed amounts for these instruments are transferred, with the instruments, into the relevant headings.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two days ago, we had a very fruitful discussion on this proposal for a balanced package and structure at the informal General Affairs Council meeting in Horsens in Denmark. I was particularly pleased that Members of the European Parliament were present and gave us very useful input in this regard. I noted the emphasis that the European Parliament put on ensuring a transparent budget where as many expenditure items as possible are subject to the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the good cooperation between Parliament and the Council on this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, you have invited me to prepare the next European Council with you, and to discuss the economic situation and the multiannual financial framework (MFF). I welcome this choice of topics. The MFF is indeed a crucial part of our response to the challenges we face, as it is a tool for investing in jobs and growth, while reinforcing stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a defining moment for European integration and for the European Union. We are seeing that even when governments are taking the right steps towards reform, they can be negatively impacted by events beyond their control, or by the lack of a decisive and comprehensive long-term response. We must recognise that we have a systemic problem and we need to articulate the vision of where we need to go, and also a very concrete path for how to get there. I am not sure whether the urgency of this is fully understood in all the capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always maintained that a combination of immediate measures with medium and long-term steps is part of the comprehensive response we need to overcome the crisis. This was precisely the multi-track approach we developed further in our communication of 30 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has proven time and again that it is capable of taking immediate measures when necessary. Just last week, the euro area Member States, the Commission and the ECB decided unanimously to support Spain in its effort to recapitalise its banking sector. This has again proven wrong those critics who say that we do not tackle our problems. On the contrary, our ability to react quickly shows our determination to tackle them head on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also need the perspective of the medium and long term. In the medium term, we must continue to implement what has been agreed, from the programme for Greece – and let me state here again that I believe Greece should stay in the euro area, assuming that it respects its commitments – to our proposals to address the more systemic issues, from setting up financial backstops, proposing initiatives for growth and reforming the financial sector to building a real economic union for the future, namely, through the steps that we have been taking on economic governance – the ‘six-pack’, which this Parliament has already approved, and the ‘two-pack’ that I hope we will also endorse today. We have been making progress on all of these areas, but I believe that more should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">For the longer term, I will urge the European Council to take concrete commitments towards a fully developed economic and monetary union and a process that maps out the steps to take to get there. More than ever, we need a strong ambition for Europe – ambition for the structural reforms that we need now, and ambition for the deeper economic and monetary union that we need to build in the medium and longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will focus on growth. I will urge it to endorse a decisive commitment towards sustainable and jobs-rich growth. This growth can only come from a combination of sound public finances, deep structural reforms and targeted investment. At national level, at the end of the second European Semester, I am encouraged that Member States have clearly taken last year’s country-specific recommendations seriously, at least more seriously than in the previous year. Great efforts have been made to implement last year’s recommendations. But more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">To supplement national action on jobs and growth, the European level should also be playing its part, and indeed it is playing its part. On unemployment, the biggest social challenge we face, the Commission has taken a number of measures, including refocusing Structural Funds, our youth employment initiative and adopting a major employment package, which I presented to you here in April.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation on the ground is very much in the hands of the Member States, and I will continue to urge them at the European Council to take the social emergency situation very seriously. In some of our countries, we have worrying developments in terms of the rise of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">On growth, the European Council should agree a growth initiative, building on the ideas we have put forward and which were well received at the informal European Council of 23 May. This includes a number of elements.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the reprogramming of Structural Funds, focusing them on growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, boosting investment at European level through increasing the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank, and project bonds – ideas I set out to this House for the first time in my State of the Union address in September last year. Now – it was about time! – they are building momentum. Two weeks ago, we agreed on our project bonds proposal to unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion in a pilot phase and I expect a clear decision on the EIB at the next European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we need to realise the full potential of the single market. I would like to see swift approval in the Council and the European Parliament for the measures of the Single Market Act 1, and the Commission will, moreover, present a Single Market Act II in the autumn. As you know, just last week, we presented a communication on the governance of the single market and how to reinforce it, as well as an analysis of the implementation of the Services Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if the Heads of State or Government agree to these strategic orientations set out in this growth initiative, we should go further in cementing this approach. Many of the decisions that we need in order to deliver results must be taken by the European Parliament and the Council together. That is why, today, I want to propose that we conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the growth initiative. Given the urgency of the situation, it is important to prioritise key decisions. An interinstitutional agreement would set a fast timetable and get things moving. It would also be a strong message about our partnership – the partnership between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It would also be a strong message about our determination for growth in the European Union. Moreover, it would ensure the required democratic legitimacy and involvement of the European Parliament, without whom we cannot advance and without which the Commission does not want to advance. On these issues that are so necessary and relevant to our citizens, it is indeed unthinkable that this directly-elected body that is an expression of European democracy could be sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of growth, it is highly appropriate that you singled out the European Union’s future budget to debate today. Quick adoption of the MFF would send an immediate signal that Europe is ready to invest in its future, that we are really serious about growth. It would send a strong message on our commitment to stability and responsibility, given the clear link we have proposed between the MFF and the European Semester of budgetary coordination. In other words, adoption of the MFF is a key stepping stone towards the deepening of economic and monetary union, and towards sustainable growth in Europe as a whole. However, the path ahead will not be easy. With reduced spending power at home, some Member States view the MFF as an extravagance to be minimised, and a potential source of savings to repatriate. This is a great mistake. Our budget is a budget for investment and for growth and I believe that we all agree that in current times, we need to combine stability and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to dispel the myth that the EU budget is a budget for ‘Brussels’, for the EU structures or institutions. No – the EU budget is money for our regions, our cities, our rural areas. It is money for our citizens, our students, our workers, our entrepreneurs, our scientists, our farmers, our innovators. It is money for the unemployed and those who are afraid of being unemployed. It is money for the future of Europe and for all those who want to have a future in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a strategy for growth – Europe 2020 – and indeed we are preparing new initiatives for growth. The important issue now is to link the MFF and the programmes under the future budget with our overall growth strategy. If we agree that for growth, targeted public investment is necessary to complement structural reforms, then this needs to be reflected in our budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of our Member States, EU funds are the biggest and most stable source of public investment. Just as an example, since 2009, cohesion policy has been equivalent to 97% of total public investment in Hungary, 78% in Lithuania, and over 50% in Poland. What would the situation in these countries be without the contribution of the European budget? It has provided stability in times of crisis, but also flexibility in times of need.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures show that the European Union budget has a major impact for growth. At the same time, the MFF is in line with sound public finances. At around 1% of EU GDP and less than 2.5% of all public spending in the European Union, the EU budget is focused on priorities, and indeed its impact on deficit positions of Member States is minor. A cut of the Commission’s proposal by ‘at least EUR 100 billion’ over the seven-year period, as some Member States are proposing, would have an effect of 0.084% of the EU GDP on public finances and deficits. This is an amount that certainly does not make or break sound public finances in Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the proposed financial framework for 2014-2020 is an essential piece of a medium- to long-term European growth and competitiveness agenda. The new rules governing EU spending will ensure that smart fiscal consolidation, investment funding and structural fund reforms will go together. The proposed new own resources, including the financial transaction tax, will improve transparency and provide new opportunities for fiscal consolidation and growth. This is the best recipe for growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Can our project be improved? Certainly, and we are very open to listen to proposals. That being said, I am also concerned with some ideas that threaten to unbalance what we have proposed. Take the idea to squeeze all the ‘off-budget items’ into the budget, from ITER to GMES. I fear that this will ultimately lead to further pressure on our margin for growth-oriented investments. I fear that this will endanger the other programmes in the different headings, from competitiveness to cohesion. I can assure you: for all items outside the MFF, the European Parliament will keep its full institutional prerogatives through the normal annual budget procedure. I hope that Parliament’s resolution on the MFF will take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now approaching the phase when the big strategic questions will be considered. While figures matter, we first need a serious look at design, modernisation and simplification, as well as the added value of the budget. In this, the Commission shares plenty of common ground with Parliament, which will adopt a resolution tomorrow. We will continue to press for Parliament’s early involvement in the negotiations, as the outcome will have major implications for the Union’s ability to generate growth, to demonstrate solidarity and to deliver on its common Europe 2020 objectives. I know that these will not be easy negotiations, but we are defending – and will continue to defend – our proposals very robustly.</p>
<p class="contents">At the core of this European Council will also be a discussion on the building blocks for the future of economic and monetary union. As you know, the European Council asked its President, in close cooperation with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Euro Group, to prepare a report that should propose a way forward. This report will be the start, not the end, of a process – a process that will be vital for anchoring our current efforts to ensure stability and growth in the longer term and a process in which the European Parliament should be involved from the early stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear: Member States must pursue the deep structural reforms that are indispensable for Europe’s competitiveness and growth immediately. The longer term vision should not be seen as a substitute for those reforms, and national leaders must leave no doubt about this. But without confidence in the irreversibility of economic and monetary union, our prospects are limited. Therefore, we need a clear and credible commitment to a vision for the deepening of the union, combined with a process which maps out the main steps towards this goal. The process should generate a progressive dynamic. It would start with steps that could and should be taken immediately, leading to medium and longer term steps which might require treaty changes. Greater solidarity and greater responsibility must go hand in hand. Each step towards further solidarity would be accompanied by a corresponding step towards greater responsibility, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a commitment will send a clear signal that the Member States and the EU institutions consider economic and monetary union and the euro as indispensable assets for Europe’s future. The main building blocks include moving towards a banking union and a fiscal union. The timing and nature of the process will vary for each building block. Some elements will require a higher degree of political integration with, in parallel, measures to ensure increased accountability and democratic legitimacy. To this end, the whole process must have the Community method as its guiding principle to ensure ever greater coherence, both on principles and on methods and instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, a fundamental point needs to be made. The Commission believes that it is essential to pursue this process as far as possible with all Member States. We advocate further integration within the euro area. It is now evident that this is indispensable for the sustainability of our common currency, and we are happy to see that also outside the euro area, in Europe and outside Europe, there is now a consensus that we need further integration in the euro area. But under no circumstances must this be seen as an alternative to the integrity of the single market, or indeed the integrity of the Union as a whole. It must be seen as a mutually reinforcing process. Our economic relations bind us all: euro area members and non-euro members alike, our futures are linked.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the treaties are clear – and I have to say this because the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties – there is only one Union; there is only one European Parliament; there is only one European Commission. This is so because fragmentation is not an option. Financial stability and economic prosperity through economic and monetary union, and within it through the euro as common currency, are common goals – for those who are already in the common currency as much as for those who are preparing to join it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that some countries do have opt-outs. These opt-outs must be taken into appropriate account in the future architecture. But they remain the exception, not the rule. Those who wish to advance must be able to do so. But enhanced cooperation or properly circumscribed derogations can allow for this without creating a risk to the integrity of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now briefly sketch out the main building blocks. Financial integration is one area where major progress could quickly be made, even without treaty changes. Thus, the creation of a banking union appears as a natural priority. I see two major steps. First, we should accelerate the adoption of proposals already on the table. That means adopting the Commission’s proposal for a single rulebook – the capital requirements rules – and beyond that, the proposals we have made concerning deposit guarantees and bank resolution, including provisions to introduce solidarity via obligatory mutual lending between national funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, by autumn, the Commission could be ready to come forward with key proposals to introduce more integrated banking supervision and common deposit guarantee and resolution funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The full benefits from deepening the economic and monetary union and from creating the banking union can, however, only be reaped with the development of the fiscal union. Here, the immediate step is building on the effective coordination of fiscal and economic policies through the European Semester, including through the swift adoption of the ‘two-pack’ proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Going beyond that, three further steps can be identified. First, we should further refine our financial backstops – the EFSM, the EFSF and its successor, the ESM – to strengthen our potential to intervene in support of financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need a serious discussion about the joint issuance and mutualisation of national debt in the form of stability bonds. This includes agreement on their preconditions, namely, much more joint decision making in all economic and budgetary matters. We will not achieve stability bonds without a greater degree of integration. In its Green Paper of November 2011, the Commission made public its ideas on how the euro area can move technically towards joint issuance of debt. A road map and a timetable will need to be worked out that also takes into account the need to build the necessary political and democratic momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, other options for a deeper fiscal integration also need to be explored. Fiscal union is much more than just stability bonds. For instance, it also means more coordination in taxation policy and a much stronger European approach to budgetary matters, both at national and EU level. I have already discussed the EU budget in the context of the MFF. In the longer term, stronger solidarity mechanisms could play an even more important role.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to the need to link the development of fiscal union with the development of political union. A deeper economic and monetary union requires deeper accountability and legitimacy. Making the technical proposals is, ironically, the easier part. But if the technical proposals are made without proper support throughout the European Union, we risk a backlash. Decisions of historic dimension need to be prepared, and the citizens need to be involved in the debate. We must work together to ensure this and we can only ensure it if the Community method remains at the heart of our move forward. I am convinced that this House, directly elected by the citizens, must and will play a crucial role in this respect: the European Parliament is the basis of European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the reasons why I deeply deplore the recent orientation taken in Council on our Schengen proposals and the European Parliament’s involvement in the relevant legislation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is the wrong signal to send at the wrong time on a core area of European construction in terms of freedom of movement. We need more, not less, parliamentary democracy in our union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by saying a very brief word on the G20 meeting next week. The EU representatives will be able to report on how Europe is meeting its difficulties with determination. We are not complacent about our difficulties, we will be open about them, but, at the same time, I hope that we will be proud to say what we are determined to achieve. For instance, the proposal we put forward last week on a common framework for banking crisis management and resolution makes Europe the first jurisdiction in the world to be delivering on all the G20 commitments to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We can expect others in the world to point the finger at the European Union and the euro area as the source of all the world’s problems, including their own. It is always easier to talk about the problems of others in order to distract attention away from one’s own problems. But in the end, we all have challenges. Ultimately, these are common challenges. We need to address them together, also on the global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s contribution must be far-reaching reforms. We need reforms in Europe. Europe’s contribution must also be a big step for an ever closer, ever stronger Union of stability and growth. I believe we have the right case to make and I thank you for your attention.</p>

It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method?</p>
<p class="contents">Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements?</p>
<p class="contents">If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like you to go further and publish, every three months, an up-to-date table of the economic and social measures on the internal market taken by each of our governments, both on the right and on the left. Europeans need to know which Member States are making an effort to get their public finances back in shape and to promote growth and jobs and are not just talking about doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">All these proposals need to be continued. We are going to haul Europe out of the crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, what the PPE Group wants is honesty with regard to our fellow citizens and, above all, a great deal of political courage.</p>

Mr Daul, we will see this afternoon how serious that applause was. Nonetheless, we applaud you for what you said.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have offered us an interinstitutional agreement. My group is prepared to go along with that. There is no point in having an agreement, however, unless it has substance. If it amounts to nothing more than us saying that we now need completion of the internal market and austerity, and all that will bring growth – which remains the majority opinion to date, even among governments – then there is no point in such an agreement. Moreover, there is only a point to the agreement if we actually pass real measures at the time of the upcoming summit. After all, am I supposed to say to the many millions of young unemployed people that, although they do not have a job, we can give them an interinstitutional agreement? They will hardly be enthralled by that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to mock what you have said; I take it seriously. I simply want to draw attention to what it is that we really need. We need swift decisions, and swift decisions in the coming days. We have a debt problem, the debts are growing and not reducing because our Heads of Government still have not grasped what this is all about and do not have the courage to tackle what you have proposed and what we have proposed in order to solve the debt problem together.</p>
<p class="contents">All of a sudden, there is talk of a banking union. If you recall, ladies and gentlemen, we proposed that two years ago. The Commission was moving in that direction, and the government officials and the finance ministers said ‘No, no, no, that is going much too far’ and ‘European supervision of the banks must be reduced – we need more national regulation’. It has taken the Heads of Government two years to think it over. At present, the Heads of Government need two years to arrive at the right ideas. The same is true of other things that you mentioned, Mr Barroso. That is the situation at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently had a large conference involving young people from all over Europe which was not linked to any political party. There were a great many young people there who had done something, rather than just complaining that nothing was happening. They had established small businesses, created start-ups. However, what they were asking was where there was currently any demand, where they could sell their products, who was now ensuring that there is growth, who was investing in infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am saying that, yes, we can talk very earnestly about an agreement, but now is the time for action. Once again, I can only quote from <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. You will see it and recognise it. The ship is in deep water and the question is – a question I can only agree with: </p>
<p class="contents">Please can we start the engine now, Ms Merkel? Yes, we have to start the engine now and not in one or two years, when it is too late. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Let me now also say something about the budget, which, after all, is an element of the growth strategy. At the moment, a lot of people are saying, ‘We want the growth, but we do not want the budget – or we want a reduced budget’. What kind of nonsense is that? It is precisely in the many elements of the budget that we find aspects of a growth strategy – much more so than in national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote somebody who is not a socialist, but rather a fellow Member of your party, Mr Lewandowski, and that is Poland’s finance minister, who said to me in conversation that everyone is talking about how we must invest more in research and development and not so much in infrastructure and the Cohesion Fund, but we also need resources for growth; we also need ways to invest in all the regions that are still in a very poor economic position.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why it makes no sense to simply cut this budget; instead, we have to use it more efficiently and sensibly. However, if we talk about being more competitive, if we say that we have to do something to make us competitive globally as well, then we cannot cut the budget – which is a small budget in any case, but which is an element of this strategy, and it is an element that we absolutely cannot do without. That is why we have to go down this road together.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the fact that you attended the Friends of Cohesion summit in Bucharest, Mr Barroso – even if you came in for some criticism. The statement could have been somewhat more strongly worded, for, on one side, there are those who want to do nothing but cut and cut and cut again and, on the other, just words. However, a good initiative has been established, because we cannot just listen to those who constantly say that we have to cut resources – we also have to listen to those who are using these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a distinction is being made between net contributors and net beneficiaries, as if one were the good guys and the other the poor people receiving alms. The net beneficiaries are not being given alms; they are receiving a good share so that they can expand their economies. I am from Austria, a net contributor country, and I know very well that my country is also profiting a great deal from the fact that Hungary, Romania, Poland and many other countries are receiving EU funding. Let us therefore do away with this division into good net contributors and bad net beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, with just a few exceptions, we were unanimous yesterday in telling the Council that the way decisions were made on Schengen is not acceptable. I hope we can retain this unanimity when it comes to the budget, that we will send a clear message to the Council, and also to all those who blindly want to make cuts everywhere, that this is not acceptable. If we cannot reach agreement – I appreciate what you said, Mr Wammen – then we will just have to go to the 2013 budget and update it. We can live with that. I hope the Council can live with it too.</p>

No, really, for the first time, I have almost nothing to add ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Exclamation from Mr Daul: ‘The groups are going to merge’.)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if they should merge. Rather, we are going to take the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) back from you. That seems like a good idea. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, the Council has just agreed on a bail-out of EUR 100 billion for the Spanish banks, and what is the consequence? Let us face it, because it is alarming: it is that the markets do not believe us. On Monday, yesterday, the spreads had gone up dramatically to more than 500 basic points, even nearly 600 basic points for Spain; nearly 500 basic points also for Italy. We have to ask what is happening. Are they mad or are we mad? Are we seeing things properly?</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I think we all know the answer in this House – maybe not the ECR and maybe not UKIP, but I think that everybody else can see that unless we find a structural and a global solution to the crisis, we will simply continue fire-fighting as we are doing now. Because that is what we are doing, fire-fighting, and fighting one fire after the other. Greece first, then Ireland, then Portugal, then Spain, and tomorrow, you may be sure, Italy. Not setting up a systemic answer, a structural solution to the crisis and not building a real firewall that can resist.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need? We know what we need. Three things: a banking union with a deposit guarantee scheme, with a single supervisor – what this Parliament already asked for two years ago and was refused by the Council. This deposit guarantee scheme is a proposal on the table and yet the Council is not even able to agree on a common position on that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing we know also: a fiscal union including a redemption fund – the one we will vote on today in the ‘two-pack’, so there is no need for an initiative from the Council or the Commission about that. They simply need to respond to the legislative proposal of the Parliament in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we know what we really need, which is a political union with a real economic government. So my plea to you, Mr Barroso, is to say that speeches here, speeches in the Council and recommendations from the Commission are all very well, but what we need now are legislative proposals from your side put directly on the table of the Council and Parliament on a banking union, on a fiscal union and on a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to wait for an agreement between France and Germany and Italy and Spain. You have the right of initiative; you can make things happen and move forward. Put your proposals on the table on a redemption fund, and put your proposals on the table for a real banking union. Do it now, in the next weeks, because I am not sure that on 28 and 29 June, our leaders in the Council will agree on a banking union and can agree on a redemption fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and own resources, I regret one thing, which is that neither the Council nor the Commission have said one word, one phrase, on something that is the most crucial element of this multiannual financial framework which is, finally, to come back to the initial idea of the founding fathers and to make a direct link between the citizens and the European Union. There is no real democracy in Europe if you only have a parliament with no say in the resources of its institutions. In every parliament, in every country, in every democratic country in the world, the parliament has a direct say on the resources of the country, on the resources of the state. So that is what we need most now in these discussions and in this debate, and I can tell you that there will be no consent from our group to the multiannual financial framework if there are no own resources in this multiannual financial framework.</p>

There will only be political sovereignty if Europe has financial sovereignty. Otherwise, it will not work. I would like to give you a brief, very practical, illustration based on the problem we are now facing. Mr Verhofstadt is right: we will only achieve financial sovereignty if Europe manages to obtain its own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean? It simply means that, today, the Member States, including the French Government, are saying, ‘We can no longer increase the national contribution’. Fine! Let us accept the situation! It is up to them to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if, as the Commission has proposed, as we have discussed, we have a financial transaction tax, a European carbon tax, a mobile phone tax, these three possibilities – and I could give you others – would bring in an extra EUR 40 to 50 billion for the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point on, the discussion becomes completely absurd. Now, we are told, ‘All right, if you have own resources, we will give all these resources back to the Member States’. The Commission’s much-vaunted proposal on the financial transaction tax posits a ‘two thirds/one third’ distribution. In other words, a third will be given directly to Member States, and the remaining two thirds to be allocated to the European Union will be deducted from national contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, 100% is given back to the Member States. There is no own resource. It is a resource diverted to the Member States and not a resource for the European Union. This will not enable us to move forward. Furthermore, the Council then tells us, ‘And you are going to further reduce the European budget’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not an abstract debate. It is the very basis of the so-called political sovereignty of Europe. If we accept that own resources are resources for the Member States and not resources for the European budget, where do we go from here? We do not have to accept this sort of horse-trading. We do not have to say yes.</p>
<p class="contents">The only possibility for Europe to be able to invest in order to create jobs and to sustain the cohesion funds is through increasing the European budget. Let us accept that national contributions are unable to finance it. However, own resources are the way to increase the European budget precisely to sustain the deficits of the economies of the Member States. It is not for the European Parliament that we want own resources; it is for the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the fight we are going to get into now, which will be a fight over the question ‘Do we accept that the budget should stay at its current level?’, would be a mistake. The truth is that, if there is no real increase in the European budget which will ensure that own resources become resources for the budget and not simply a return of resources to the Member States, if we do not have this power, this capacity, then, despite all the talk of European sovereignty and the need for more Europe, we will not succeed in delivering the necessary policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our legitimacy, it is our credibility as Europeans that we are defending. That is why, when it comes to financial perspectives, we must say to the Council and to the Member States, ‘Do not assume that, this time, Parliament is going to lie down. You will see that you will not have any financial perspectives if you do not move consistently. Otherwise, stay at home! You are spending too much money with your summits and that is pointless’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of us warned that a monetary union with a light touch, which was envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, could not work and, for a single currency to succeed, significant centralisation of power would be required – a centralisation which, for many of us, was totally unacceptable. That is where the EU finds itself today. It is bringing more centralisation upon itself in what is an increasingly desperate attempt to get ahead of the crisis, which so far it has completely failed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When the markets are unimpressed, when the Spanish banks are lent EUR 100 billion, then there is a clear signal that the failure is continuing. This latest Spanish bailout lasted barely 24 hours before it was, as Mr Verhofstadt said, being questioned on the markets. If I can use a somewhat crude analogy, it is a little bit like wetting your pants at the North Pole. At first it feels warm and comforting, but very quickly you realise just how much trouble you are in fact in.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two points. First, it would be unacceptable that the measures it is proposed we take should fall upon those who proposed originally to steer clear of this risky venture and, second, those countries who signed up to join a single currency with one set of governing rules should not now be obliged to join a single currency with a completely different set of governing rules. So those countries that are not yet in the euro should be released from their obligation to join.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 20 years, the EU has become ever more out of touch with public opinion, and that has shown in many recent elections and referendums. The people of Europe are becoming increasingly worried about centralisation, and about the remoteness of those who are gaining more power in the EU by the day. In no area is this seen more starkly than the management of the EU budget. The Commission talks about synergies, about investments, about added value, and the public just sees waste, mismanagement and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">An even bigger budget is being requested. The public just wonders why it is that for 17 years in succession, the budget has been implemented with significantly high levels of illegal or irregular payments. People here are complaining that the concept of value for money is somehow getting in the way of European solidarity. The public just wonders how on earth one can justify wanting even more money when the money already being spent is spent so badly.</p>
<p class="contents">To win back public legitimacy and regain trust, the EU needs to take reform seriously, it needs to respond to the needs of the people and not impose ideas upon them. Make no mistake, when we are facing so many different crises on so many fronts, we are very fast running out of time.</p>

It is surely illogical for the Commission – for Mr Lewandowski and Mr Barroso – to be saying to Member States: ‘you have to impose austerity, you have to reduce your budget, you have to get your fiscal balances under control – oh, but by the way, we want more of your cash taken to a European level to spend on your behalf because we know how to spend it better than you do’.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are not sitting there with large piles of cash. They are all running fiscal deficits.

Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to make it clear that a fiscal union based on the ‘two-pack’ is, in my opinion, tantamount to declaring the old European idea bankrupt. Once again, Parliament is having to catch up with events. That is my concern.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of June, a summit will be held and we are preparing for it. It will go ahead, the family photos will be taken and people will behave as if everything will go on as before with a few minor changes. However, we are already right in the middle of the changes. We are still hearing the old fairy stories about the good old EU. It seems, and this is one point which I would like to highlight in particular, that the initiatives are contradictory. One amounts to the introduction of supranational structural policies and the other consists of the increasing renationalisation of policies during the course of the crisis. These are two sides of the same coin, in other words, a fiscal and banking union to allow the EU to continue as a neoliberal project on a new level. This is accompanied on both sides by massive cuts in social services, drastic reductions in public spending and more stringent sanction mechanisms. Part of the logic of this way of thinking is that the parliaments and, in particular, the European Parliament should be marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I strongly support the protests against the separation and renationalisation of elements of the Schengen Agreement. For this reason, I am very much in favour of Parliament making a clear statement about the multiannual financial framework and not allowing itself to be pushed aside. The Community method must not be replaced by the Union method. This must not happen. The institutions rely on one another and if one institution tries to reduce the power of the others, the result will be the collapse of the idea of the European Union. I would like to make this clear in the light of the multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for us to talk about the fact that the original EU subsidy policy has now been reinterpreted. Funds which were intended to reduce the discrepancies between the Member States and the regions are now being used to create a multispeed EU – it is no longer possible to talk only about two speeds – and to increase the competition to attract new businesses between the regions within the European Union. The weak must remain weak and the funding will go to areas where global competitive strengths can be increased and market orientation is needed. This is why the macro-economic conditionalities are being introduced and why subsidies for the regions are being abolished if the Member States fail to meet the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is both absurd and cruel for you to penalise the people who live in these regions on several levels. You know exactly what I am talking about in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we need sustainable growth which focuses on strengthening the public sector and on public responsibility. This is why I believe that you have the wrong priorities and the wrong conditions. This makes discussion about a different Europe more difficult. Why are you blackmailing the Greek voters? Why are you criticising all the serious initiatives and alternatives that come not only from those on the left but also from academics in several European countries. They are saying that we need to open up a window which will allow us to gain some time and to link the two serious concerns of the Greek people together. They want to stay in the euro area and they want conditions that will allow them to survive and to live normal lives. We in Parliament must commit ourselves to achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU wants to spend more money, but that money simply is not there. The EU wants its own revenues – read taxes. In case you have missed it: we are in the midst of a crisis with severe consequences for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us be absolutely clear: the Dutch Party for Freedom (PPV) is against the EU’s own resources and, along with other Member States, is demanding a drastic reduction in the EU’s multiannual budget of at least EUR 100 billion. If we follow this reasoning, we come to the conclusion that democracy is not guaranteed <span class="italic">here</span>, but in Member States, where it belongs. Fortunately, each of the Member States has a veto when deciding whether or not to approve the multiannual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If it were up to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, then all of them would continue to enjoy a nice snooze while the importance of Dutch sovereignty is frittered away. However, we <span class="italic">do</span> still believe in the nation state that decides if any, and how much, money will be spent outside the national borders.</p>

We were forging ahead with a strong sense of cooperation. We agreed that, in order to solve the problems, we needed to put in place active, realistic austerity measures. We are now in the process of adopting the ‘two-pack’ and the cooperation is suddenly no longer working. The compromise in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has failed because some of the groups have stopped collaborating. All of a sudden, we are hearing people here saying things like ‘We simply need to spend more money and our problems will be solved’, but everybody knows that this is nonsense. Where will the money actually come from? There are limits to what can be expected of other groups of Europe’s citizens, in terms of how much they will be prepared to spend. On the other hand, is what Mr Cohn-Bendit just said true? In that case, we must raise taxes and ask the citizens to pay up once again. This is just the same old response, the same old story that has never worked.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we must take the difficult route, which means saving and making sure that the money we have – and we do still have money in Europe – is spent intelligently and in the right places. Is the money that we have being used where it is needed and is it having the impact that we promised ourselves? Where are the reports on what is happening, the checks and the consideration of whether we are doing the right thing? Qualification measures, spending money correctly, putting incentives in place, creating trust and taking a long-term approach are what is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot buy growth. That is simply ridiculous. We have to work for growth. We need to create the right conditions for growth so that people can bring it about and we need to make sure that we stay on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union budget is one of the strongest instruments for providing growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not like the national budgets. This is not just another tax burden for the citizens. The EU budget is not just another item of expenditure in national budgets. It is small but it is efficient. It creates economies of scale, it creates economies of scope and it can direct investments at European level at very targeted goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget is currently 44 times less than national budgets in Europe. It costs every European citizen a coffee per day. That is the cost of Europe to European citizens. At the same time, it has decreased over the last 20 years by 20% in relative terms, whereas national budgets have increased in recent years. In 2011, 23 out of 27 countries increased their national budgets. In 2012, 24 out of 27 countries increased their national budgets. So I would argue that, if anything, Europe is becoming weaker because the EU budget is becoming weaker and national budgets are becoming stronger. This is what has happened in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union budget goes back to the Member States. Ninety-four percent of the EU budget goes back to the Member States. For example, I have met a Polish Minister who said that for every one euro invested in cohesion policy, nearly 70 cents go back to the old Member States, to the contributors. From the investments made in cohesion between 2000 and 2006, we have 0.7% growth in Europe and that might reach 4% later on. So when we speak about the EU budget, this is not a budget which is spent badly.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, Mr Callanan, the European Court of Auditors said that the UK is one of the examples with the highest error rate in spending EU money. This is not a reason to decrease the EU budget. You have to fix the systems in the United Kingdom. When we speak about own resources, this means that we have to decrease national contributions. That would help the consolidation of the national budgets so we would very much insist on what …</p>

Jensen (ALDE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, as a Member of Parliament’s negotiating delegation for the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF), I would like to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency and its Minister for Europe, Mr Wammen, and his team for the sound, open and trusting collaboration that we have enjoyed. You have listened to us, and we have enjoyed a heads-up about what was on the way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major package. It is not, after all, just about the economic framework; it also involves almost 60 different legislative proposals that establish future agricultural policy, the rules for the Structural Funds, for research programmes, for educational programmes, for transport investments and investments in energy. It is thus an enormous complex that is now to be adopted, and it seems to me that you have handled it well.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said many times today that the budget is an important tool to ensure growth and jobs, and it is important that we should have this multiannual framework in order to make it possible to plan investments and to provide certainty in respect of the common agricultural policy. But, and it is a big but, 2020, which is the year up to which the framework runs, is a long way away, and there has to be flexibility, as unforeseen events could happen before 2020. We need flexibility both in the shape of reserves and in the shape of the ability to re-jig funds if we find we want to change our priorities at some point in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me illustrate using the example that, six months after the last time one of these budget frameworks was adopted, the Russians turned off the gas supply to Bulgaria, whereupon we discovered that we needed an EU energy policy. There was no money to support such an energy policy, however. We came up with a solution by finding unused money within the agricultural budget, but it is not certain that we will be able to do so in future. There is thus a need for flexibility, and that will continue to be the case in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must consolidate our budgets, introduce structural reforms and take targeted measures to stimulate growth, for psychological reasons, so that we can give the citizens of Europe new hope and also overcome our common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wammen began his speech today by saying: ‘Europe needs growth and Europe needs jobs’. At the same time, Denmark belongs to the club of net contributors who want to cut the European budget. How stupid, short-sighted and un-European! The multiannual financial framework is one of the instruments for growth that we urgently need. We must achieve our common goals: collecting taxes and introducing the financial transaction tax, because it is a fair instrument. We must finally get around to implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only fair for the banks at last to contribute to financing the crisis. That must not only be the job of the taxpayers. The responsibility for dealing with the crisis must not be unloaded onto them. The proposal made by Mr Lewandowski is a good one. You have finally realised that we need to make progress with the financial transaction tax now. Two-thirds of it must be used as own resources for the European budget. The Member States will have one benefit from this. They will need to contribute less money to the European budget and, in addition, they will have another incentive. They will be saving their own money and we will be able to finance our cross-border policies jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to promote this idea once again. It is not a radical left-wing proposal, Ms Merkel. Mr Lewandowski belongs to your own group of parties and, what is so important, we can implement this proposal in 2012. If everyone were to join in, we would have EUR 47 billion of additional revenue by 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Ms Merkel and all the other Heads of State or Government, how can anyone be so stupid that they do not want to understand that the European budget is the democratic element which will stimulate growth in Europe, with the involvement of Parliament. We in Parliament and the Council must finally summon up the courage to implement this sensible policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That majority still think, moreover, that they represent the citizens of Europe. The words spoken here by Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn-Bendit are, unfortunately, not isolated views, but convictions clearly shared by the majority of the European Parliament. The majority here actually believe that it is possible to build some kind of unified, centralised federal state in place of the EU. The demands to introduce own resources for the European budget unfortunately belong to the rhetorical toolbox of this federalist tendency. Giving the European budget its own resources will clearly allow the European Parliament and the Commission to inflate the budget. It will weaken the link between Member States – which are the foundation stones of European integration – and the European level. It will also allow the Commission and the European Parliament to further circumvent the Member States. For this reason, such a principle is unacceptable. I hope that the European Council and those governments that still retain some sanity will say a clear and emphatic ‘no’ to this plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Participation <span class="italic">pari passu</span> means fair redistribution of European GDP. Participation <span class="italic">pari passu</span> means that German citizens and Maltese citizens participate <span class="italic">pari passu</span> in the election of Union leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards States’ debts, where those debts accrued because the system generated debts for one State while, for the same reasons, generating profits for another State, the only solution is to write off those debts. It is also high time the European Central Bank started lending to States, rather than banks. The Union’s needs and objectives cannot be serviced by economies that decimate the prosperity of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the method of financing the Union, successive adjustments to the system have benefited the most wealthy Member States, because some such countries, which apparently are paying a contribution to the EU budget of over 10%, are, in fact, paying less than 1% of their per capita GDP. A budget financing system based on traditional own resources, in conjunction with the abolition of corruption and discounts, would be the most advantageous, because it is more in keeping with the principles of justice and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Members of the Commission – and these comments are addressed to the Council, too – you know yourselves that you are stuck in a number of traps, not just as regards debt and growth, but also as regards confidence, and in the power trap. I regret to say that, so far, you have, in fact, failed to tackle the central issue, which is that the financial sector has become detached from the real economy. Whatever we have decided here, the experts constantly counter this by saying that still no serious boundaries have been imposed on the shadow banking sector, there are still systemic risks, that the issue of ‘too big to fail’ has still not been appropriately addressed – and we need hardly mention the ratings agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are currently preparing for the Council summit, then I can only urge and advise you to restore credibility in Europe by dealing seriously with the issue of the balance of power between the financial sector and the real economy.

We are convinced that the budget is necessary to finance strategic investments in the internal market and its infrastructure, crucially needed in order to boost jobs, sustainable growth and competitiveness. I therefore very much welcome the broad agreement on my report on project bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, we must avoid deep splits between institutions and Member States, particularly between richer net payer countries and the poorer ones. In this situation, we must build bridges, not dig trenches.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me focus on the negotiations on the financial framework. They are complicated, as several different procedures are involved. Codecision on sector programmes, consent on the MFF as such – meaning a veto for the European Parliament – a right for Parliament to be heard on own resources, and, on top of that, an interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not easy, so let us speak clearly. This Parliament, elected to represent the citizens, will not accept that Member States’ leaders take decisions in areas subject to codecision such as Structural Funds, research, agricultural infrastructure, etc., without a full codecision procedure. That procedure can be finalised only when we have an agreement on the financial envelopes.</p>
<p class="contents">Two, the positions on the MFF agreed by the European Council must be negotiated between Parliament and the General Affairs Council in order to get our consent. A <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, Parliament and Council should have fully-fledged negotiations on all MFF-related aspects and programmes before deciding on figures and finalising the MFF package.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I agree with Mr Wammen: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but that includes MFF ceilings and legislative programmes as well as own resources. I am quite convinced that we will be able to find a reasonable solution as we know how important this is for the future of Europe. We simply cannot afford to fail.</p>

<p class="contents">For us, four priorities have been identified, the first of which is the establishment of the financial transaction tax. For many years, our group has defended the introduction of this tax, the aim of which is to regulate the speculative financial mechanisms which are largely responsible for the current crisis. This tax will bring in new resources without penalising economic or social equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority, made possible by the creation of this tax, is for the European Union to obtain substantial own resources as a substitute for the contributions of Member States. This will be a major leap forward for the European institutions, which will no longer be held hostage by any particular net contributor country. The EU will be able to commit its own resources in complete freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is to ensure that an adequate budget is available, at least at the level of the debate of our Parliament on the report by its Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE). The creation of the financial transaction tax should have enabled us to go further, but, at the very least, we must avoid any regression. Less budget would mean less Europe, when what we need today is more Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fourth priority is to focus our budgetary resources on a central objective, that of accomplishing the ecological conversion of Europe in terms of its agriculture, its industry, its transport, its energy efficiency, and in many other areas. In dealing with the crisis, the European Union has a duty to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we do welcome investment in research and development in the single market and in cross-border infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are three points which I have to make. First, the budget must be able to demonstrate real added value. Too many of the traditional spends in past budgets clearly have not, and we must understand that quantity of spend is no substitute for quality. Second, it must be fair: we are open to suggestions on new own resources, but I have to say that a financial transaction tax would not be acceptable, nor indeed would the abolition of rebates. Finally, this House would be mistaken to assume that we could increase the size of the budget at a time when all the rest of Europe is facing austerity, financial disciplines and hard times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate is not about having more Europe or less Europe. Current events force us to think about a completely different Europe: participatory, united, regional.</p>
<p class="contents">A century ago, a certain Luigi Sturzo, exiled in England and writing in the English newspapers, was more modern in his thinking than this House, which refuses to consider Europe’s problems from the point of view of territories and regions, which is to say the productive, hard-working world which is the reality for our people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would like to represent the people of the industrial triangle of agricultural production of Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, where a major seismic event has caused serious problems for one of the most important productive centres in Europe.

There is no central intervention on the ground that responds to the expectations of these communities.

<p class="contents">The aim was to create a project – the European project – based on the deregulation of the market, which gave way to the biggest financial racket in our history, involving a single currency with no public treasury and a European Central Bank that does not issue that currency. We are therefore dealing with a financial racket that needs to be investigated. That is what we proposed in the Spanish Congress: a committee to investigate the racketeers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is costing EUR 100 billion to rescue them, but also to condemn the Greek people to a worse standard of living, to be denied good public services, to have to work for longer and to lower salaries and pensions. This is the result of the economic course that we wish to call into question.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be paying the proportion of the sovereign debt that is the result of speculation.

You might pay your money without receiving what you have paid for. In the present MFF, 44% of the EU budget is being spent on sustainable growth. That will go up to 48%. Is it really being spent effectively? Does the EU really know how to spend Member States’ money better than they do?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s embracing of globalism and neoliberal economics, of open markets and maximised competition will defeat any strategy for growth. As Sir James Goldsmith said a decade ago, the only way the West would compete with the emergent economies in a free market would be by our wage levels equalling theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to think our research and development will make our industries more competitive, but innovation spreads by industrial piracy by the Far East and industrial treachery by western-based multinationals. The Commission’s Europe 2020 document waxed lyrical about Europe’s talented workforces, but that presupposed that the present populations of Europe would survive and would not be replaced by immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a <span class="italic">fait accompli </span>nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On a professional level, however, it is clear that governments have much less direct leverage on growth. Austerity is a direct result of restrictive fiscal policies, but there is no such thing as a growth policy. Government action can have only a very indirect and stochastic impact on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In a market economy, most productive investments are undertaken by the private sector. It is only the private sector which can create sustainable jobs leading to increased output and tax revenues. The government can only facilitate this process by creating a business-friendly environment and investing in physical and human infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgets are important tools to support private sector activity. The MFF is considered as such. It can contribute to growth only if it concentrates resources on investments and initiatives to improve competitiveness and productivity. The MFF should envisage more spending on research and development, education and infrastructure, and cut back significantly on current subsidies, including on agriculture.</p>

<p class="contents">The resolution we will vote on today includes our key messages towards the meeting of the European Council at the end of June. Our basis for negotiations remains the Garriga report from the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges (SURE). We say very clearly that we need adequate financial resources in the EU budget which are linked to better spending; we insist on the Community method; we say very clearly that we are not ready to agree on expenditure without a proper agreement on future own resources; we insist on the unity of the budget as an iron principle; and, of course, we are asking for sufficient overall flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, despite some positive elements in the negotiation boxes on the unity of the budget – although the details are yet to be negotiated and this must also include the additional means which are outsourced at this stage – we are talking about EUR 24.5 billion – the negotiation box on flexibility is still quite empty, and it has to be filled to come to a good solution. And, of course, we have to follow the rules in the consent procedure and to respect the codecision procedure of the 65 multiannual programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say as well that the position of the President of the Commission is, in some ways, understandable, but, on the other hand, there is a huge risk concerning giving up the Community method and going back to national contributions in special instruments. This is a real danger in the long term and is working against the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say as well that we should not only talk about better spending in the budget. Concerning budget consolidation, it is also important that the Commission stop any proposal for EU legislation which means additional bureaucratic burdens and costs for Member States, for regions and local communities, and the legislator has to do likewise.</p>

I stress also that within the package of the 65 multiannual programmes on cohesion and agriculture policy, the Commission did not fulfil the request of its own Secretary-General asking for a reduction in the bureaucratic burden, asking for simplification. If ministers in the agricultural sector are telling me that there is an additional bureaucratic burden of 15 to 20%, we have to correct this. We cannot ask for budget consolidation at Member State level and, at the same time, force them to spend more on bureaucracy because we have decided on complicated EU legislation. This is a very important element, in terms of consolidation and progress and legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of unspent resources is concerned, I would like to refer back to the Policy Challenges Committee. The question of carry-overs of unspent funds and reprogramming to obtain better spending for SMEs and to combat youth unemployment are very useful elements.

That really would be something to celebrate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on an institutional level, I was pleased that our Chair, Mr Daul, reiterated the suggestion that the President of the European Parliament be invited to the European Council. However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament. Since the establishment of a permanent presidency, we have had no contact with the Heads of State or Government. We need political dialogue at the very highest level with the Heads of State or Government and with Mr Van Rompuy, who is absent from this House far too often. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result of this cooperation has been the negotiation box, among other instruments, in which the relationship between expenditure and income was retained, in keeping with Parliament’s express demand, and which makes this a precondition for the final solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also valuable that the negotiating box will now be included on the Council’s agenda, where growth, but also the European Semester and hence fiscal consolidation at Member State level, will be discussed. Because, thanks to our own resources, the proposal before us allows Member States to reduce their contributions and, therefore, to make more room in their own budgets to contribute, with their own resources, to a growth budget, which is essential for the European budget going forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time that we lay down basic principles that will ensure both growth and budgetary orthodoxy. The budget can make an essential contribution to that. I hope that the meeting of the European Council will also be an opportunity to send out a structural signal to the euro and the euro area.

<p class="contents">Can you justify, in these times of precarious employment, doing away with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is supposed to support workers who have lost their jobs because of globalisation, especially when we have to reinvent an industrial policy for Europe? Solidarity and insecurity are affecting a new population of young people, unemployed workers, women and pensioners. Yet those same people who were unable to manage this crisis would choose to do away with the European food distribution programme? Mr President, I ask that it be maintained beyond 2013, without doing away with any other essential programmes.</p>

We reject the strengthening of macro-economic conditionality because, in a time of crisis, we need to be able to adjust the support policies where economic growth is regional and where jobs can be provided.

<p class="contents">Two: we witness two standards of treatment and macro-economic conditionality of Member States, different for big and small countries, and once again different for eurozone Member States and non-eurozone Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: we witness a two-speed Europe, not just expanding, but becoming more and more acknowledged and approved, irrespective of the wishes of President Barroso. This threatens the very integrity and unity of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Four: we witness the mounting erosion of the Community method with intergovernmentalism and national egoisms resurging.</p>

<p class="contents">The banks should indeed be rescued, but this should not cause more damage to the social rights and living conditions of the Spanish people; the banks should be rescued, but it should be done in order to save a whole generation of young people from ruin; the banks should be rescued, but with parliamentary control over how this is implemented and its effects. This does not, however, solve the problem of growth. In order to grow, we need a strong European budget, a debt redemption fund, eurobonds, more involvement from the European Investment Bank and more activity from the European Central Bank.

For this reason, we need at least as much money in the future budget as we have had available to date. The Friends of Cohesion are not against better spending of the money. However, I am not sure whether the friends of better spending in the Council really want good cohesion policy, which is something we need in order to overcome the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second point I would like to mention. In the negotiation box, which has also been mentioned frequently here, 90% of all points in the area of cohesion policy are basically decided with the European Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure. Please would you accept that this time, for the first time, Parliament is involved in the ordinary legislative procedure for all areas of cohesion policy. The negotiations in committee will be complete in mid-July. We will then have a mandate and be able to negotiate. I hope that the Council will be prepared to do the same at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot therefore simply involve the proposed freezing of a series of measures and initiatives that people do not understand. Instead, we need to be able to find sufficient symbols and unequivocal signs in this Council that a new era is dawning in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A plan needs to be decided upon, with a timetable and priorities, and, above all, short-term measures need to be as important as medium and long-term measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the areas where action needs to be taken. The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has recently sent the President of the Council and the President of the Commission an action plan with five measures. What we wish to highlight, however, is the need for a new European structure that can bring an end to the instability and turbulence that we are currently experiencing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States are under unprecedented pressure from immigration. The position of the Union within the global economy is being tested. The solution is more Europe and stronger common bonds, by which I mean common European policies, with obvious European added value. European economic governance and economic and social union are being promoted as an urgent need. The multiannual financial framework must be a strong and effective instrument in the recovery of the European economy and in creating sustainable growth and jobs, stimulating investments, promoting research and innovation and achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion. We need a link between targets and European funds and to place the EU 2020 strategy within a strong multiannual financial framework. For example, if the agricultural sector is to increase its contribution to the production of public goods for the benefit of Union citizens, we need a strong budget for the CAP. Ambitious targets need ambitious funding.</p>

I believe it is a major problem with cohesion policy that my home country could lose one-fifth of the support it receives.

The people of Europe are finding this discussion increasingly difficult to understand. It may be that many of the Member States’ Heads of Government are tired by the crisis, but are they so tired that they do not see that the European budget is, in fact, one of the most important instruments for stimulating growth? It is the European budget which makes Member States allocate own resources for investment. Every EUR 1 channelled through Structural Funds means that a further amount of between EUR 2 and EUR 5 has to be invested in the Member States from public and private own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the example of cohesion policy proves that the traditional dispute between net payer countries and those which make greater use of EU funds does not have a <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. Recent research shows clearly that a large proportion of every euro spent on cohesion policy in the EU’s Member States comes back to western Europe in the form of increased consumption, higher exports or greater demand for modern technologies and services. So all attempts to reduce the European Union budget do no more than provide only apparent savings and, as a consequence, contribute to a reduction in the competitiveness of the entire Union. I hope that Parliament and the Commission will not give up their efforts to defend cohesion policy and the size of the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an inevitable decision in view of the inability to finance through bonds at close to 7% interest and 500 points’ difference from the German bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">This reminds us, however, that a change of tack is required, which means that political union is not solely limited to banking surveillance, but rather a need to reassess the deficit review schedule, mutualisation of the debt, and a budget with the resources to fund strategic investments that stimulate growth and create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It also means preventing a messy exit from the euro by Greece, which is an issue we must resolve within days rather than weeks. Furthermore, it means changing Europe’s image, which is increasingly identified with the so-called ‘men in black’, who threaten sanctions and use a stick, but no carrot, with no stimulant for growth and no hope for young people.</p>

So be it. Why not? It might even be a good idea.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if you do not raise the ceilings in proportion to what you have put back into the budget, we can expect a double cut, because the Council today, Minister, is unable to identify its negative priorities. The SURE report asked for them but there has been no response.</p>

Therefore, I will make only two short points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a general one. We are all under the shadow of a crisis, but it should not overshadow the basic truths nor justify some unfounded points I could hear on the margins of this very good debate in Parliament. The European Union, which still holds a 20% share of world trade – with the share of Japan and the United States clearly declining – does not deserve the metaphor of a Titanic.</p>
<p class="contents">We do face problems. They are not national. Therefore, a national answer is not enough. We should transform the emerging mantra of growth and jobs into reality by a more systemic response to banking and fiscal union, which is emerging, including through today’s votes in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My second short point concerns the multiannual framework, which is part of the solution, not part of the problem. I can illustrate this empirically with a credible paper from the UK Treasury indicating where taxpayers’ money is going. The UK middle-income taxpayer contributes GBP 28 to the European Union, which is the same as for the fire service. National debt interest servicing is GBP 363 rather than GBP 28. This is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget is not the answer to the problem, but could be part of the solution, via investment to act as a carrot via the Structural Funds – nobody denies this and it was also part of the anti-crisis resistance in my country of origin – with the stick of conditionality enforcing structural reforms. This part of the answer concerns own resources. Mr Zahradil was wrong. This is not about expanding the budget but about changing the proposal, fully respecting the fiscal autonomy and the sovereignty of the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the design for the future: more Europe under the Lisbon Treaty with the same amount of money. I am happy to see Parliament’s resolution going in the same direction. Jutta Haug is right. <span class="italic">Einigkeit macht stark</span>.</p>

<p class="contents">We face a major challenge: a growing shortage of water, energy and arable land; and, by 2050, nine billion people to feed.

With investor confidence in the market in decline and the new Member States queuing up for financial assistance, there are still doubts over the need for such solutions as a debt redemption fund or eurobonds. I congratulate the Commission on the proposals put forward on a banking union and its determination to seek a balance between budgetary discipline and long-term growth and job creation. However, the essential commitment – combating fraud in the Member States – is missing. The situation that has come about is unjustifiable because the Commission does not know the true scale of corruption as the Member States are not providing the necessary data. The fight against fraud must be strengthened and the Commission must take responsibility for the illegal use of funds and their return to the EU budget. While discussing economic recovery, we must not forget that we need to protect our markets from too much third-country influence. Economic operators in third countries take advantage of the openness of the EU market while our economic operators in those countries operate under much more difficult conditions than local operators. We have thus reduced our competitiveness and narrowed the labour and business market for our own citizens. I believe that combating fraud and market protection must become one of the foundations of future cornerstone initiatives and strategies, which would help ensure a more stable and speedy economic recovery in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I assume that she knows what she is talking about. Three months is more than enough time for us to do what must be done. It is purely a matter of political courage.

It has a pro-growth orientation, and it is aimed at supporting the European economy. The financial instruments within the new MFF can also support further cofinancing from private and public investors. I very much welcome the orientation of the new MFF towards growth, development and a sustainable environment. The creation of new, green jobs is important as well. I also welcome the retention of the European funds, especially the Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, which contribute not only to the strategic and long-term development of Member States, but also short-term, rapid and targeted support addressing the consequences of the crisis.

The Commission’s programme for more money to be sent to the centre, bound by tighter regulation, with the impetus of closer economic union, forces cash flow to be circulated around the eurozone pulling Member States into a maelstrom of economic destitution and political control. It is the concept of more Europe that has exacerbated, if not created, the entire crisis. If the EU’s reactions have been, as both President Barroso and Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain proclaimed, successful, then the crisis would surely be over. Yet the EU’s actions have been successful in forcing the European project along at a pace by furthering state capitalism. In the USSR, highly centralised government and economic policy inflicted poverty on millions of voiceless citizens. The echoes are chillingly familiar. The only difference is that the EU has not used tanks to subsume countries by force, but masterminded the use of subversive bureaucracy alongside the prolongation of the economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One the one hand, they want to go further with everything that has been leading to divergence between the Member States: free competition in the internal market, the now-reinforced Stability and Growth Pact, the liberalisation of international trade and common policies created to suit only the few. On the other, they want to weaken instruments that could mitigate or even, ideally, overcome inequalities; the EU budget plays a key role in this. There can only be one outcome: more divergence, more inequality between Member States and less cohesion. What is happening in the Council is a disgrace. The greatest beneficiaries of the internal market and common policies now want to reduce even further their contributions to the EU budget by forcing the compression of the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. They want to cut the budget and cut cohesion funding. They also want to seek a greater share of this cohesion funding. That is what results from conditionality proposals, from ‘transition regions’ and from changing the weighting coefficients associated with cohesion.

I am pleased to note that today’s statements by the Council and the Commission already showed moderation, because with such a tense mood, it is questionable whether the European summit can be successful. Still, I respectfully ask the members of the European Council to carefully review the efforts made so far, and to only commit themselves to a higher level of integration if it involves openness and preparedness throughout Europe, and especially if, while securing the long-term functionality of the European banking system, it serves the actual interests of at least 500 million citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the EU budget should be a strong investment budget. We won’t be able to exit this crisis and restore sustainable growth and employment without an ambitious budget that gives Europe the means to achieve the targets set in the 2020 strategy. It should also guarantee fairness in distributing the resources and sustainability. Therefore, it is important to ensure that Cohesion Policy continues to receive adequate funding. Moreover, I am also worried by this new tendency within the European Commission to reduce funding for citizenship programmes. The decrease in funding also concerns gender-related issues, which is a very negative development in the light of the need to combat discrimination and promote equal opportunities policies.

The Council should not encumber these lines with the costs of major infrastructural investments. I would like to remind my fellow Members that a popular metaphor likened the COMECON in its final years to 12 emaciated cows milking each other. Today, the European Council must not be allowed to share the same fate; the 12 yellow stars should shine with the light of excellence and progress. We need an EU budget that is able to stand on its own feet and is supportive of growth; a budget in which ITER (the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) and GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) are financed from outside the seven-year financial framework. However, if the Council decides otherwise, then it should also allocate the proper financial conditions, and should not once again draw away the necessary funds from R&amp;D lines. I believe that to entrust the Council with the supervision of the disbursement of funds is like setting the fox to watch the geese. Indeed, the decision taken last week by the Council of Ministers demonstrated that the ministers for finance are capable of cutting down the amount of research disbursements for the ongoing year with a single, parochial decision taken by a close circle, even without the knowledge of the ministers for development.

Before we approve the multiannual financial framework, we must achieve a political agreement on a reform of the own-resources system that would ensure its transparency, fairness and sustainability. Furthermore, in determining expenditure under the European multiannual financial framework, we must strictly adhere to the principles of solidarity, balanced territorial development and fair competition.

Putting the economic situation back on its feet requires measures which are effective in macro-economic terms but which are also acceptable politically. The many aspects of the financial crisis and the lack of a firm political response at the outset mean that there is not now an easy and painless way out of this difficult situation. The euro area is still in need of urgent reforms. Some of them have already been carried out – the ‘six-pack’ should be mentioned here, as well as the ‘two-pack’, on which work is currently in progress. However, these pieces of legislation are only an answer to some of the institutional problems involved, and their effect will only be seen in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the way the financial crisis is continuing to get worse requires action which will have an immediate effect, because the crisis of confidence and pressure from the market are today seriously impairing the Member States’ ability to refinance their debt. The forthcoming summit is an excellent opportunity to make bold decisions. First and foremost, measures should be adopted which do not require treaty changes, that is, steps to make the process of fiscal adaptation more flexible and to improve the firewall to give greater protection to the financial systems of peripheral states. The next stage should be institutional reform of the euro area, by which I mean creation of a common system of recapitalisation and restructuring for banks and a common system for protecting deposits, and development of a plan for at least the partial mutualisation of public debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that Parliament should insist on greater flexibility, clarity and transparency, especially in the forthcoming budget, and adopt a position on own resources, as they are known – on reforming the system in such a way that funds would be amassed directly in the EU’s own budget and, at the same time, the contributions from the Member States could be reduced accordingly. A reformed budget is needed as part of a more integrated monetary policy. A more integrated monetary policy is not at all as novel an idea as one might sometimes think, reading the headlines. When the notion of a European monetary and economic union was only in its infancy, a work group led by the British economist, Donald McDougall, was set up to consider the structures involved in a single currency. The McDougall report, as it is referred to, states that, in general, areas using a common currency guarantee the value of their currency by means of a central or federal budget, which is largely funded by taxes collected by a central administrative body. The report says that, depending on the level of integration, the joint budget should account for between 2.5% and 7% of the Union’s combined GDP. The Union’s present budget accounts for not much more than 1%. The US federal budget, for example, amounts to a good 20% of GDP. Although, for Member States struggling with financial difficulties, calls for an increase in the joint budget understandably sound virtually impossible, we should insist on an open and creative attitude on the part of the governments of countries towards the joint EU budget. It takes adequate resources to implement uniform policies. A commitment to common objectives means that one is also prepared to commit the resources needed to realise them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as cohesion policy is concerned, the message is clear. That policy is the only pan-European development policy and, as such, should continue to be available to all regions of Europe. Cohesion policy is the main means for responding to the crisis, as it makes a decisive contribution to growth and to job creation. Cohesion policy is worthy of and entitled to adequate resources. The Commission proposal is NOT the minimum for us as regards cohesion policy. If we want to achieve growth, as cohesion policy is a development policy, if we want to find effective answers to the crisis, THEN we need the resources to achieve it. For cohesion policy, the minimum is the current financing level, as clearly decided in the SURE report. We do not support an increase in the cohesion policy budget; if we maintain current budget levels and use modern, thematic targeting and are guided by the results of cohesion policy, we shall achieve a great deal more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our choices have become narrower; we can say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the framework. Thanks to the work of the Hungarian, Polish and Danish Presidencies, we are continuously in touch with the Council so as to prevent a ‘no’ by Parliament from turning over a hard-fought consensus, seeing as how there are some red lines that cannot be crossed according to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One such red line is the matter of cohesion policy. Since developmental disparities between the regions of the EU are stronger than ever, Parliament demands efficient and effective cohesion. EU funds spent on cohesion policy must not be reduced; we must maintain at least the level of 2007-2013. This is a difficult task, as the European Commission’s proposal is already envisaging an almost 5% cutback in the total framework, with Member States only being allowed to draw funding to the amount of 2.5% of their GDP. What is more, the basis for calculating the 2.5% ceiling is not future economic growth but the period between 2008-2010, where Hungary suffered serious economic downturn under its socialist governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means it will total EUR 1.025 trillion, with cohesion policy accounting for the largest share, exceeding the common agricultural policy for the first time. The European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions accept some aspects, such as the intermediate regions, the increased allocation for territorial cooperation projects, the creation of the Common Strategic Framework, and continued Cohesion Fund support for countries with a GNI less than 90% of the EU’s GNI. It is important to stress that the June European Council is the first time that the MFF 2014-2020 and the new cohesion policy regulations will be discussed. I consider it essential that cohesion policy levels be kept at the same level as for the last programming period – 2007-2013 – and that the outermost regions have enough funding from the additional specific allocation to tackle their natural constraints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In defining and implementing its policies and actions, the EU must take into account the requirements in terms of promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social protection, combating social exclusion, as well as the requirements for a high level of education, vocational training and health protection. I think that the EU needs a common agenda on economic growth and job creation, with a particular focus on youth employment. We call on Heads of State or Government to set out and adopt this agenda. In this context, the multiannual financial framework is an effective tool which helps achieve economic growth in the EU. With regard to the governance of the Schengen system, we call for the codecision process to be used and for Parliament to be involved in all the decisions relating to the free movement of persons, one of the EU’s greatest achievements. We are also in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area, given that both the Commission and Parliament have acknowledged on several occasions that both states meet the necessary technical criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
