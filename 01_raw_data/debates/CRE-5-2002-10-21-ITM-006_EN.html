This resolution, should it be passed, will represent a formal contribution to the Convention from the parliamentary delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have looked at the impact so far made by the Charter as a solemnly proclaimed instrument and we have found that much use is made of it by the Ombudsman, by Parliament, by the Commission and even sometimes by the Council. We have found also some uncertainty among the citizens about the Charter's scope as a solemnly proclaimed instrument. For the courts, the Charter is already an important source of reference alongside the ECHR and the constitutional traditions of the Member States. Yet the national constitutional tradition referred to is already broad and, in a Union of 25 plus Member States, it will become improbably vague. Therefore, we conclude that we must incorporate the Charter firmly within the Treaties, so that what is at present an important source of reference will become a central source.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission Vitorino and his working group in the Convention are considering the technical and semantic niceties that will be involved in incorporation and I look forward to hearing from him how successful the efforts of his working group are proving. This parliamentary resolution refreshes the political story of the Charter. It says why incorporation in the treaties is important and why it should become mandatory upon the Union and upon the Member States, when and, in so far as, they put into effect European law and policy. It also says why the Charter will become an important building block of the further development of the concept of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">As we enlarge, the Charter succeeds in spelling out for all concerned why fundamental rights are so salient to bringing Europe closer to the citizen. It proposes that we establish for ourselves our fundamental rights regime at the centre of the integration process so that it will stand as a jewel in the crown of our future constitution. I commend the report to Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate Mr Duff, not only in his capacity as rapporteur for this report but also in his capacity as a member of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The report we are discussing today is based on the previous positions held by Parliament, adopted when the Charter was drawn up, in the course of 2000, and these recommendations fully respond to the aim of making this Charter the basis for a constitution. I am speaking in my capacity as Commissioner but, of course, I cannot ignore the fact that, at the same time, I represent the Commission in the Convention on the Future of Europe and in that capacity, I chair the ‘Charter’ working group. Without going into details, I think I can tell the House that the members of the working group for the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty have expressed broad consensus on the answers to give to the technical issues with which we are wrestling and which concern the modalities and consequences of the Charter’s potential incorporation into a future constitutional Treaty as well as the modalities and consequences of the European Union’s potential accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is an enormous degree of unity between the recommendations contained in Mr Duff’s Report and the conclusions of the working group. To be specific, I would first emphasise my agreement with the fact that the Charter today is a reality that has truly taken root in European life, being used by citizens, by the Advocates-General, in judgments of the Court of First Instance, and by national courts, even at the highest level; the constitutional courts of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duff’s Report also makes the observation that incorporating the Charter will not attribute new competences to the Union. The Charter is already clear on this matter but could be more explicit in the horizontal clauses providing for the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty, especially in order to allay the fears that some people have expressed. The Charter is not in itself a source of competences or a legal basis that will enable the Union to pass legislative measures. It is a source of reference for the values that must be present in all EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Charter does not in any way limit the competences of the Member States. It does not replace the system of Member States in the field of human rights, and is not designed to replace the role of national constitutions. I therefore share the rapporteur’s opinion emphasising that the Charter must now be given binding legal force and a constitutional status, in accordance with modalities to be decided and which will depend on the future structure of the Treaties</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that two alternative solutions are being drawn up for this matter. Firstly, one which in fact deserves the support of the majority of the members of the Working Group, the incorporation of the entire Charter, in the form of a title or first chapter in the Constitutional Treaty. Alternatively, the inclusion in the work of the Constitutional Treaty of an article referring to the Charter containing the entire text of the Charter, dealt with in a specific section of the Constitutional Treaty or in a protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also quite legitimate at the current juncture not to attempt to amend the provisions of the Charter before they are validated in the Constitutional Treaty. The Charter represents the political commitment of the previous Convention, which this Convention must respect. This does not mean, however, that some technical adaptations should not be made, especially with regard to the so-called ‘general’ or ‘horizontal’ clauses. The ‘Charter’ Working Group has been working on this matter and the aim is to come up with adaptations that do not affect the substance of the provisions and are instead designed merely to clarify the meaning of the current horizontal rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Commission have always looked favourably on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights. The rapporteur reiterates this point of view, which I welcome. The members of the ‘Charter’ Working Group take the view that the Union’s accession to the European Convention is fully compatible with enshrining a charter with constitutional value and binding legal force. In this regard I believe that the result achieved by this working group will also receive a very broad consensus. If the Union does indeed accede to the Treaty, it will become subject to external control, which is entirely in line with that exercised by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg over the Constitutional or Supreme Courts of the Member States. In this sense there is no subordinate relationship between Courts and nor is the independence of the European Community’s legal system affected.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is closely linked to that of the future legal personality of the Union. The task of the Convention is indeed going to focus on incorporating a constitutional provision into the Constitutional Treaty to enable the Union to negotiate accession in practical terms with the Council of Europe and to decide, in accordance with normal procedure, when accession should take place and under what conditions, without in any way undermining the individual commitments of each Member State to the European Convention on Human Rights and its additional protocols.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that incorporating the Charter into the Constitutional Treaty and the Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights will constitute two fundamental milestones in the process of giving the European Union a constitution that acknowledges the values and principles of fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A working group within the Convention was set up for this very purpose, competently chaired by Commissioner Vitorino and which is ready to make its conclusions public. Today, the European Parliament, through the report by Mr Duff, seeks loudly to reaffirm the position it has always maintained. I should like publicly to express my agreement with his conclusions and to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on the extremely broad consensus that he was able to add to his achievements in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in no doubt as to the need to make the citizens and their rights the focus of our shared existence. What we have is not so much a market but a collection of women and men who give this Community meaning. This is why we wholeheartedly call for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated as the major part of the future Constitutional Treaty of the European Union. We are aware, of course, that many of the rights, principles and freedoms could have been worded differently and will have to be revised in future. No human work is perfect. From our point of view, however, that time has not yet come. It is time today to clarify and strengthen the legal status of the Charter, giving it a binding nature and increasing the legal protection of European citizens from the European institutions and from the Member States when they apply Community law. We therefore support the strategy advocated in this report and its main conclusions: to make it the major part of the new Constitutional Treaty, to lay down formal rules for its revision and, following the explicit attribution of a single legal personality to the European Union, to advocate accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Essentially, the debate we are having today might appear to be merely technical: what status will the Charter have in the constitution that will come out of the Convention?</p>
<p class="contents">This debate poses a question that is absolutely essential from a political standpoint: what are we to do about the debate on citizenship within this Convention? Fortunately, our Charter does not simply address citizenship, but also represents, for our fellow citizens, an essential reference point, and from the beginning of this process, we have said that the Convention must aim for a more democratic, more comprehensible, more transparent Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What our fellow citizens are asking is to be able to feel that they are European citizens. It seems to me that the tool currently available to us to make citizenship come alive is the Charter. So let us incorporate it. Parliament has already requested this many times, and will do so again in voting for Mr Duff’s Report. I believe this is a prerequisite for the work of the Convention to be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is knowing how to incorporate it. My concern, personally, is that this incorporation would confer first-rung status on the Charter in the hierarchy of European texts. This basically means that when one sector or another needs to lay down provisions in its field, it must respect the spirit and the letter of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of a revision therefore arises, and we know that this is a debate that has caused much concern, including when the work of the previous Convention was concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of us here, I believe that the current Convention does not have the authority to re-open this text, and I also believe that this would be politically inappropriate. The main thing is to check how this revision could take place, because there is no reason to imagine that these texts are written in stone. We ourselves, in drawing up this Charter, took a few liberties with the text of the European Convention on Human Rights, due to the need to adapt and modernise it. Let us imagine that our successors might also need to adapt the text: this would have to take place in the same conditions in which we ourselves wrote this text. Basically, the Charter could only be revised according to the most restrictive rules proposed by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I have tabled an amendment to this end and I hope that Parliament will be able to adopt it when voting on Mr Duff’s Report.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end with two brief comments. First, I am anxious to know whether the debate – which is theoretically technical – on the so-called ‘horizontal’ clauses runs the risk of limiting the scope of the Charter. This should be our common approach: no reduction of the Charter’s scope. Lastly, of course, I would like to express my support of the European Union’s signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights, on my own behalf and on behalf of my group. In this way we will have a complete set of measures to protect the rights of our citizens and our residents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that there should be no end of lively discussions of the Charter and of the position it is to occupy in relation to the work of the Convention. I should also like to thank Commissioner Vitorino, not just for his principled support for further work on the Charter but also for pointing out that it would not be at all easy to incorporate the whole Charter into the future constitution or wherever else it is to be incorporated, the constitution’s being the most likely candidate. What I think is important when we discuss these issues as politicians is that we constantly live in the tension between the vision and the reality. The vision is clear enough. I must go back and say a little about the content, but we would all want the whole of the Charter to be incorporated. The Charter is important. It embraces important human and other rights that it is important to secure for the citizens of Europe. On the other hand, we also need to decide our attitude to the facts, or current political reality, and ask ourselves how much of the Charter we could pilot through now that there are 15 countries in the EU, with the hope of there in actual fact being 25 once we have embarked upon the Intergovernmental Conference. It is this tension that we always need to be clear about. I support the Charter. I have always thought it was a good Charter. I have also worked on it in relation to the Danish constitution and must say that it is rather better and more forward-looking than, for example, that particular constitution read only as it stands and without the whole historical background. I do not believe that all the existing constitutions are ideal but I also think, on the other hand, that the Charter is at present becoming something of a ‘sacred cow’. I therefore think it good to be able to look at whether some articles are more important and more significant than others and at whether there are matters it might not be thought crucial to incorporate at this stage. I should like to thank the Commissioner for his openness and for making it clear that the issue is really not so straightforward as all that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament has for a long time already been the motive force behind this issue in the EU. This report, addressed directly to the Convention, finds Parliament again doing justice to its political role. I would therefore like to say how very grateful I am to the rapporteur, and, for that very reason, address three issues that are also reflected in my amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">For many people, the primary and justified expectation is that the Convention will decide in favour of the incorporation of the Charter into the constitutional treaty, and so it must be ensured that it contains not merely guiding principles for the institutions of the European Union; these must give rise to binding rights, which are to be safeguarded by the European Union and, which, if need be, can form the basis of any citizen's appeal to the courts. The report – in its item 1, for example – is quite right to frame this as a demand.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view, though, that Parliament is frustrating its own objectives when it is stated, under item 2 of the report, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be incorporated into European constitutional law only in the form of a preamble. A preamble could perhaps serve as some sort of pretence of a future constitutional treaty, but, in legal terms, it is not a norm relevant in law. I believe that such a stance on Parliament's part would be understood by nobody at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are right to demand that the EU should accede to the ECHR. It is already becoming evident that a majority in the Convention favours this position. If Parliament wants to continue to be the motive power behind this, then, I believe, it must also call the associated problems by their proper names. I consider Recital Z to be inadequate in merely pointing out that the ECJ stands in the same relation to the ECHR as does any national constitutional court. To say that is to draw a veil over a problem, as the fifteen Member States take very different approaches to the issue of relations between the national constitutional courts and the Court of Justice in Strasbourg. In my judgment, the constitutional treaty must give its own answer to the question contained in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make my third point to the rapporteur later on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council's refusal to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding in law therefore puts us in an absurd situation, in which, on the one hand, fundamental rights are regarded as an inevitable consequence of the recognition of human dignity, whilst, on the other hand, people are denied the chance to exercise their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for again making it clear that it is Parliament's top priority to incorporate fundamental rights into the European constitution, and indeed that they are a foundation stone without which a constitution is utterly unthinkable. I concur, though, with the comments made by the lady who spoke before me, in that it is not the preamble that I envisage being used for this purpose, but Article 1 of the constitution, but I do not imagine that there are any serious differences between us on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, secondly, grateful to the rapporteur for his observation that we must not allow the chapter on the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be reopened and renegotiated in the Constitutional Convention, which has no mandate to amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights. If we were to again call the Charter into question, it would damage the credibility of the first Convention as a whole and thus also shatter the method of the Convention as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there is, to my mind, a certain contradiction – and hence my question to Commissioner Vitorino, who has picked up this point – in the announcement that amendments are to be made to the horizontal provisions, which form an essential part of the stipulations on the scope and effect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is perfectly conceivable – and some discussions lead me to suspect it – that an attempt is being made to use the horizontal provisions to limit the Charter's scope. Any such attempt must meet with resistance from us.</p>

And this is, in fact, another excellent opportunity to reflect on this key issue: the truth about European integration. The rapporteur, for example, proposes the following: ‘The Charter does not attribute competence to the Union. On the contrary, it has the effect of limiting the exercise of power by the EU institutions because of their obligation to respect the Charter’ (end of quotation). And he adds: ‘The Charter does not limit the competences of Member States under the Treaties. It is not a substitute for the fundamental rights regimes of Member States, but a complement to them’ (end of quotation).</p>
<p class="contents">This should indeed be the case, for two reasons: firstly, because the Charter has not yet been given legal power by the only body competent in this matter, the Intergovernmental Conference; and secondly, Article 51 of the Charter itself states, as has already been mentioned, the positions upheld in the current Charter are aimed at Union’s bodies and institutions and the Member States only when they apply Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, this is not true. There are many facts proving that attempts are being made to make the Charter an instrument for imposing unity on the Member States and for maintaining supraconstitutional tutelage over them. We will shortly have, for example, the Swiebel Report proving this clear shift in the form and the methodology used to study the situation of human rights and to assess Member States. We also had, last year, the Cornillet Report in the same field. In short, if the rule of law is still the rule of law we can only state that the Charter is unfortunately already leading to reactions against the normal rule of law. This is something we should condemn. This is not, however, the recommendation of the rapporteur who, on the contrary, appears to welcome and applaud the reactions, steps and guidelines of the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the Ombudsman and even the European Courts, which heap scorn on the competences of the Intergovernmental Conference and seek to act as if the Charter were already law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the case. The rule of law is not ‘as if’; the ‘law’ either exists or does not. I am, therefore, afraid that there is a desire to subvert the rule of law and that this is precisely what we are doing as a result of this ambiguity. This report must, therefore, be supported enthusiastically by those who …</p>

<p class="contents">I consider this declaration to be premature, as certain major issues have not yet been resolved. We are told that the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties, which would render it binding at European level, would not give the Union any additional competences. This, however, cannot be believed. We are told that it would not require the text laid down in Nice to be re-written in any way, but this is impossible. The text would certainly need to be re-written on certain points and this would open Pandora’s box. Lastly, we are told that this incorporation would by no means take power away from national democracies, but this is a fallacy.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Mr President, the Charter runs the risk of being rigidly imposed on national democracies, which we consider to be very dangerous. That is what I explain in the minority opinion appended to the Duff Report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who had the honour of being actively involved in the Convention that drafted the Charter will realise that the broad consensus was not self-evident at the time. It is the result of very thorough, exhaustive and intense efforts. For that reason, we must prevent the text of the Charter from being re-submitted for discussion. Sterling work was done at the time. Tabling sections of the Charter for discussion will only weaken this excellent piece of work. My advice therefore would be to leave the Charter as it is, except for technical changes. This is the first point I wanted to make.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the combination of the Charter with the ECHR, which has spawned more difficulties than necessary. This is evident from a number of articles written by judges and experts from the two courts of justice in Luxembourg and Strasbourg and is also clear from the work of Mr Vitorino's Convention working party. It turns out to be highly feasible to synchronise the work of both courts with regard to the ECHR and with regard to the Charter. This is also the view taken by our PPE-DE Group here and by the PPE-DE Group in the Council of Europe. We are therefore of the opinion that the path has been cleared for the Charter's inclusion in the new constitutional Treaty. It is our desire to do this and we will therefore commit ourselves to this in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my third and final point, namely the Charter's importance for EU citizens. It is crucial for the rights of our citizens to be firmly anchored in the new constitutional Treaty that is being drafted. We know all too well that citizens' rights , minorities' rights, and social rights are still very fragile, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It is all the more important that these rights are enshrined in the new treaties and, above all, in the constitutional section of the Treaty. These rights should, in my view, be enforceable. In that way, citizens in Western and Central Europe can count on the same constitutional rights – rights enshrined in a European constitution, guaranteed by the Union and, if necessary, enforceable by European courts. This seems to me to be the thrust of the Duff Report, which is why we will be endorsing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must also become binding. Congratulations to the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their intention that the Charter should form part of the constitutional treaty. I agree that it should not be mentioned only in the Preamble, but that the Charter should form the first chapter of the constitution. We are always saying that this constitution should be able to be read in schools. This Charter is wonderfully readable; it would make a fine preface for a European constitution, and its reflection of Europe's values leads me to believe that it should actually be printed in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">My second train of thought leads me to the view that the Charter should be incorporated without any changes being made to it. It was the subject of really lengthy discussion in the first Convention, and I cannot see any reason to amend it again. At most, there might be a need for editorial adjustments to the transversal articles, but not substantial alterations. They contain everything on the Charter's scope, and do not need to be duplicated and made more complicated. Our rapporteur is to be thanked for his excellent report, which will without doubt become an important document for the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One looks in vain to the report, however, for a serious discussion of this legally and politically quite crucial issue. I shall content myself with making two points. First of all, why do we need an EU Charter at all when we have the European Convention on Human Rights, endorsed by all the EU Member States? The answer is, because the EU as such has not endorsed the Convention. By making a simple treaty change, the EU should, however, endorse the treaty as a matter of course, and that is something also recommended in the report. When that happens, however, there will be an inevitable clash between the Court of Human Rights and the EC Court of Justice. The report’s talk of smooth cooperation is sheer nonsense, legally speaking. Secondly, the crucial part of the Charter’s agenda is about promoting the EU’s permanent expansion. The Charter is purely and simply a building block for an EU federal state. Both citizenship and a constitution are part and parcel of a federal state. As is apparent from, for example, paragraphs 7, P, X and N, the citizens of the European Union are being subjected to the EU’s federal authorities. This all constitutes destructive and outrageous interference in matters of national law, and the fact that a veil is being disgracefully drawn over this is reason enough for voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have tried to cooperate with him on two points. The first, which many other speakers have referred to, is the insistence that the Charter should be incorporated as it stands into the Treaties. As Mrs Almeida Garrett has said, all human work is perfectible and of all human works, legal texts are usually the most perfectible. However, there is a Spanish saying that states that the best is the enemy of the good and, in this case, the choice is not between this Charter or a better Charter; the choice is between this Charter or no Charter, and we believe that this Charter is what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, Mr President, consists of expressly pointing out something that this Parliament has included in its Rules of Procedure: the Charter is already binding for us; for us, the Members of the European Parliament, this is already the parameter in accordance with which we must ensure that legislative initiatives conform to fundamental rights. We cannot forget this. If we, by means of the Corbett Report, have included it, we cannot be the first to disown it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore my group – and I myself – are going vote enthusiastically for the Duff Report, because we believe that the Charter has the enormous merit of being the first Union text that has the support of the public. This is its great merit, and not any provision on its reform. This will ensure that the Charter is not watered down or distorted in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">European public opinion is behind the Charter, whatever some people may think, since many people think it is very important to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, because the credibility of enlargement and confidence in it must be founded on a common stock of principles and rights which consolidate relations between States and citizens, whom history has deprived of the ability to live together and to trust one another. Secondly, because the new citizenship of the Union, which places European citizens at the heart of European legitimacy, requires their defence and protection against any abusive behaviour that could result from the centralisation of power in the name of efficient decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore find a basis for giving the citizens direct access to the Union’s courts and we must similarly define the mechanisms that will persuade national courts to apply the Charter in the name of the citizens. The status of the Charter must, therefore, be raised to that of primary law, making it a fundamental source of reference for the Court of Justice and for national courts, thereby making this instrument basic Union law and a genuine integral part of the Community’s legal acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of area of freedom, security and justice would we be building without a Charter of Fundamental Rights? What kind of model for civic and political co-existence could exist without this? Mr President, no new competence is being created as a result of the Charter. On the contrary, it limits the exercise of power of the future Union. Furthermore, no right is being removed from those already enjoyed by the citizens of the Member States, and nor is any higher protection being diluted into a Charter that lays down only minimum rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if we wish to have an organised democracy, based on common values, let us make the Charter form the basis of a Constitution, making it the fundamental source of reference and protection for the Union’s citizens. This is what the report states, this is the opinion of Mr Duff and this I believe, in fact I am sure, is the opinion of Commissioner Vitorino. I heartily congratulate both of them! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree that it is right that all the institutions of the EU should observe the same standard norms, but I am still less convinced that such legal constraints need to be included in the Convention. I also feel that they should not be enforceable by the EU on Member States beyond the present commitment represented by their signatures on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. They should not apply to private companies, individuals or organisations, nor should they cover matters of social affairs, employment or cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are being presented with a vehicle filled with good intentions. However, I fear we are also opening up a nightmare of duality in the appeal, on the one hand, the European Court of Human Rights and, on the other, the European Court of Justice. We have cases changing from one to the other, profiting only the lawyers. I am sorry for those of my colleagues who are distinguished lawyers, I do not wish them any diminution in their profits, but this is not something we should encourage. Recital V shows that this is already happening. The prospect of conflicting authorities being announced in the two courts is bureaucratically intolerable and a judicial nightmare.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 2 also concerns me. The Charter must bind the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the Committee of the Regions, but should it be a 'central reference point for the European Court of Justice and national courts'? No, it should not be a central reference point of national courts. This is another indication of the potential for confusion. This confusion must be sorted out before this report is adopted. I urge Parliament to reject this report and allow the committee to resolve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am only going to refer to two procedural aspects: firstly, the prospect of extending the competence of the Court to hearing cases of an individual nature which, until now, are faced with considerable legitimations from a procedural point of view (from the point of view of the legitimation, interests or the recognition of the individual rights concerned). And secondly, Commissioner Vitorino’s reference to the possible ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the problem is not as simple as Commissioner Vitorino has suggested – as Mrs Kaufmann has stressed – because it is not simply a question of imposing the European Court of Human Rights on a Constitutional Court, but rather of a supranational construction – a Community construction – with a Court of Justice that has very particular characteristics, and imposing a different procedure on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I disagree with most of the views of my predecessor, Mr Stockton, I believe that this issue will probably warrant a study, not in relation to the Charter itself, but also the competences of the Community institutions, in particular the competences of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the issue should be studied by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will pay it the attention it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would presumably be the easiest solution for my own country too. All the same, I do think, however, that we must think longer and harder, for if the idea is that people should identify with the treaty, they must be able to consult the treaty or constitution and see outright what rights they have in relation to the EU. I therefore think that the maximum solution should be chosen whereby the EU is endowed with legal personality and accedes to the Convention of Human Rights, for this solution would give the Court of Human Rights more authority in relation to the EC Court of Justice. If we opt for the maximum solution, however, we must at the same time be open to the anxieties that might legitimately be felt by certain Member States, especially when it comes to issues of national identity. I should perhaps have liked to have seen the rapporteur insert just one simple clause to the effect that we must bear this concern in mind, for if we in actual fact listen to the legitimate concern the Member States may have and, at the same time, opt for the maximum solution, I think we shall succeed in combining the broad vision with the facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To my Eurosceptic friends, I say that this is not some subversive plot. The Charter carries great authority and legitimacy. What it lacks is clarity and legal certainty. It is precisely to ensure that we can improve the position as regards certainty and clarity that we are seeking its incorporation. We are not being shamefully silent, as Mr Crowley said, on the impact on national law. The charter primarily concerns the competences of the European Union and the powers of the Union authorities. Finally, can I say that Lord Stockton and I find ourselves in appropriate political parties in Great Britain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be one of the bases for the conversion of the pillar structure of the Union to a Community structure.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I have noted the increase in the citizens’ requests for protection of their rights, which shows that their relationship with the European institutions, particularly Parliament, is constantly improving. I support the establishment of the ‘European Ombudsman’ to safeguard the financial interests of the Union, of the European arrest warrant and of the mutual recognition of judgments and the work of Europol – institutions which require greater coordination and organisation and a more specific horizontal and vertical division of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">After the elements of Community law relating to criminal law, I believe it is important to address the civil law elements too and, in particular, the relationship between the citizens and the legal systems of the Member States, some of which need to be reorganised, including the administrative and civil justice systems of my country. Without altering the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States, the Union needs to play a positive role allowing the citizens to benefit fully from the ‘right to justice’. Moreover, the Union must reflect on the issue of the relationship between the citizens and the Court of First Instance with a view to making European justice tangible for the citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
