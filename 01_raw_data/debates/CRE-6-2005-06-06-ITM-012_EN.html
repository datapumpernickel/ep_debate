<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for having taken over this proposal on the guidelines for trans-European energy networks and for having carried out a focused analysis in her report which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. I would like in particular to express my gratitude for her commitment, together with that of the shadow rapporteurs, in aiming for an agreement at first reading which, I very much regret, has not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall on this occasion the objectives of the proposal. The challenge of the proposal is to build a legal instrument that will be efficient in delivering the necessary energy transmission infrastructure, while developing the appropriate cooperation with the private sector and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The security of energy supply and the functioning of the internal energy market are key policy issues. These objectives are taken up in the trans-European Energy – TEN-E – guidelines aiming at the installation of an electricity and gas network of truly European character by better linking the fragmented national networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning natural gas, there is a strong growth perspective. The trans-European energy networks policy aims at securing and diversifying additional gas import capacity from sources in Russia, Norway, the Caspian basin region, Northern Africa and the Middle East, and providing the necessary interconnection capacity between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the electricity networks, the main function is to create and foster a real European electricity market. For this objective, sufficient interconnection capacity between Member States is essential. Since the adoption of the existing guidelines for trans-European energy networks in June 2003, the need has arisen fully to integrate the new Member States and candidate countries in these guidelines and further to adapt those guidelines to the new European Neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The revision of the TEN-E guidelines proposed by the Commission in December 2003 should be seen as a complement to and an improvement on the existing guidelines. It aims at explicitly incorporating the ten new Member States into the priority projects, as well as the incorporation of essential energy connections with third countries. As to the choice of the projects, we have proposed to introduce a top-down approach, identifying the projects of highest priority on the priority axes from the larger family of projects of common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The projects of European interest are those of highest priority. They have the objective of supporting the rapid implementation of the most important cross-border interconnection capacity. To achieve this aim, the projects of European interest need to comply with special criteria. They must be situated on a priority axis. They are of a cross-border nature or have significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity. They must be mature: that means that a firm commitment must exist to start before the end of 2006 and that the projects need to be completed by 2010 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential element of our proposal is the European Coordinator. The European Coordinator will encourage cooperation with users and operators, and promote the projects amongst private investors and financial institutions. A coordinator may be designated by the Commission and will act in the name of, and on behalf of, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I now look forward with great interest to your debate on the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, let me also express my deepest gratitude to my fellow rapporteurs for their opinions, which have been in my mind throughout my considerations and which have made a considerable contribution to the report that I am presenting today. I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and the representatives of the Council for their attention and for their answers to the many questions we have raised. Finally, my thanks go to the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to my assistant for the help that they have given me.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you recalled the objectives of this proposal for a decision. They are to adapt the guidelines to the shape of the European Union of 25 Member States, to authorise the financing of common-interest projects, to make it possible to create an internal market for gas and electricity and, principally, to ensure that there is security of supply via interconnections between the Member States and with neighbouring countries: south-east Europe, the Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus. This approach to the trans-European energy networks corresponds, in fact, to the approach taken for the trans-European land transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy supports the new ideas introduced by the European Commission to define the action priorities, particularly the description of projects of European interest located on high-priority routes and the appointment of a European coordinator, provided, however, that this is limited to complex projects that present particularly difficult implementation conditions and that it occurs in consultation with the Member States. Parliament must also be consulted on the appointment of the coordinator, which is the aim of the amendment proposed by my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The report voted for by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy encourages the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves when this is made necessary by the implementation of transnational enquiry procedures taking into account decisive criteria, such as security of supply, the project’s impact on the environment, the opinion of the inhabitants of the territory concerned, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of information provided by the Council, the Committee on Industry felt that the Council’s recommended approach was consistent and made it possible to simplify the Commission’s original proposal. Thus, the report voted for by the Committee on Industry establishes a hierarchy of projects: common-interest projects that form the basis of the trans-European projects are listed in Annex III and priority projects described as projects of European interest are listed in Annex I.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry did not want to call into question the projects established by the Member States, because it felt that it did not have sufficient competence or information to assess the choice of projects. Nevertheless, following comments made by some of my fellow Members, I would like to ask the European Commission to verify the validity of the projects when this decision is applied. By way of example, our fellow Members from the Baltic States think that it would be more appropriate to have a gas transport network crossing the Baltic States to supply them, rather than an offshore network in the Baltic. As another example, the EHT line between France and Spain is giving rise to very forceful protests from the inhabitants of the region. That is why the financial package allocated to these projects should be increased to EUR 60 million, which would make it possible, for example, to respond better to environmental constraints, which may require more thorough feasibility studies. It is a matter of validating the projects, of coordinating the procedures for consultation between the Member States, of finding the most appropriate technical solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would also like to stress the fact that the Committee on Industry views the inclusion of the transport of olefins in this text as justified not only in view of the importance of such networks in Europe for the European chemical industry, but also in view of the gains in terms of safety and the environment that would result from a reduction in road transport. Besides access to the European Investment Bank, the reference to olefin-related projects guarantees a symbolic European label. It does not, however, enable these projects to benefit from European subsidies under the budget for trans-European networks. I think it is also necessary to consider the integration of the trans-European energy networks into the European corridors that have been proposed for the land transport sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to draw your attention to a few aspects which might stand in the way of achieving the tasks advanced in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, creating interconnections in structured supply systems is not always in the interests of those suppliers who dominate in any particular region. In such cases, investment in interconnections must be assessed from the perspective of medium-term and long-term returns. This requires market principles to be replaced by long-term planning methods to guarantee security of supply for consumers and environmental protection. The thinking is similar when an interconnection has to be created in the interests of security of supply, to overcome an inadequacy of production capacity. In such cases it is not always possible to adhere to market principles, as the time required for recovering the investments may not correspond to the objectives of a participant in the competitive market. In cases where creating new interconnections is not in the interests of participants in the electricity market, creating network elements may be a public service obligation for system operators. Therefore, the choice of the priority interconnection elements of trans-European networks which will be created with the financial support of the European Union should not only be a matter for commercial competition between regions and Member States, as appears from the approach offered by the directive. When making its choice of priority network elements, the European Commission must be guided by the interests of medium-term and long-term security of supply and the creation of the European Union internal market. The European Parliament ought to retain a supervisory role over this process through the budget procedure. In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the three Baltic States are totally isolated from the European Union’s electricity and gas market. Since Soviet times they have been in a joint electricity supply network with Russia. This ought to be a priority task, a priority area where interconnections should be created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance of this proposal stems from the fact that the development of interconnections is a necessary condition for the creation of a genuine internal market in energy. Furthermore, the interconnections will provide us with better guarantees for dealing with occasional situations of scarcity of electricity supply. As has been pointed out, following the informal three-way dialogue with the Council and the Commission, it was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament at first reading. We do not agree with the Council’s desire to eliminate projects of European interest and we support maintaining the categories of project advocated by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the rapporteur’s amendment that modifies the text relating to the post of European coordinator, maintaining the amendment approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to the effect that the coordinator should be appointed for those projects that raise difficulties and that Parliament should be consulted in relation to the appointment of the coordinator, something that was approved in the case of the trans-European transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a very important amendment, presented and approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. I am talking about a new recital 2(a) which takes up the objective established by the Barcelona European Council that electrical interconnections between the Member States should account for 10% of installed generation capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to applaud the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation, which is being debated, on the funding of the trans-European transport and energy networks. That proposal, for the first time, provides for the co-funding of projects in the field of energy and not just preliminary studies.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that this will be taken into account when establishing the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 because, if the budgetary allocation is reduced, this and all of the European Union’s programmes, such as Rural Development, Life, Trans-European Networks and the Seventh Framework Research Project, will be negatively affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is, I think, a good one, in that it clarifies our need for more trans-European energy networks if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals, which have to do with making our continent more competitive. Two things are clear: firstly, that networks are needed within Europe, and secondly, that there is no guarantee that they will be problem-free. Far from it: it follows that integrated networks can result in a problem transferring itself to other networks, although security of supply is generally enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also needed is an increased supply in the shape of the diversified supply of energies, especially of course of crude oil and natural gas. I will take this as an opportunity to observe that you, Commissioner, someone whose dedication I otherwise greatly respect, were not present at the commissioning of the important pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan by way of Tbilisi. The presidents of the countries involved were there, as was the Energy Secretary of the United States of America, but there was, alas, no sign of Europe’s Energy Commissioner or, indeed, any other Commissioner. When such an important pipeline is built in a region covered by the European Union’s neighbourhood policy, connecting a potential Member State of the European Union, or at any rate a country with candidate status, I would have liked the photograph to include you – not just because I like seeing you in pictures, but because it would have had symbolic significance for the European public, indicating that this European Union of ours cares just as much about energy as does the administration of the United States. I am well aware that the American administration was behind the building of this pipeline, but we ought also to have made our presence visible. It may be that you were not invited or that you could not be there, but perhaps you could give a brief explanation of your absence either today or on some other occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other things I would like to mention. You are quite right to say, Commissioner, that we have to bear in mind that there are certain projects of European interest, and that these must be supported accordingly. I agree that the European Coordinator can be important, and so I would like to endorse what has been said by certain Members, including Mrs Laperrouze, to the effect that this House needs to be consulted prior to his appointment, although the appointment itself is of course a matter for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To recapitulate, I believe that energy supply is vital to our continent’s competitiveness, that we need a diversity of sources of energy, including those from outside the EU, and I hope that Commissioner Piebalgs will be able to be present the next time an important pipeline is opened, thereby demonstrating the importance of energy supply to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speaker has also noted this matter in her speech today. Two projects have been included in the priority list of the guidelines under consideration, that is, the Northern Trans-European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany and the Yamal-Europe transit gas pipeline route to Germany via Belarus and Poland. The list of projects of general importance includes the Amber Project, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the territories of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Naturally, the specific routes of pipelines result from particular agreements between the gas companies and the countries concerned; however, I would like to point out that the Northern Trans-European transit gas pipeline project partially disregards the interests and needs of all European Union states along the pipeline route that are concerned with the supply of gas. The 2nd project of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline fails to meet the provisions for gas supply safety as it crosses the territory of Belarus, and we should remember the blocking of the gas supply via Belarus in February 2004. We need an additional merger of the gas system of Eastern and Western Europe so as to ensure the safe provision of natural gas to consumers, to create a common and functioning gas market and satisfy the growing need of the European Union for natural gas in the mid- and long-term outlook; therefore, I propose to enter the Amber Pipeline from Russia to the European Union into the first appendix of the list of general significance projects, that is, the list of priority projects, as a possible alternative for Yamal II, while passing a new decision concerning the Council and European Parliament project. Such a merger complies with the priorities set out in the Community guidelines in 2003 and indicated in the project under deliberation. Such a gas pipeline route would also make a sound contribution to the settlement of security problems of the European Union and the Baltic region in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what makes this debate so very different from that on the transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We repudiate Mrs Laperrouze’s report, certain aspects of which we have not, despite our efforts, succeeded in improving. It is our belief that this wish list of 300 projects of European interest will do no more than make the hearts of the energy supply companies – which, in Europe, amount to oligopolies – beat faster, and will be more likely to give additional power and influence to European energy suppliers, who are already too powerful in acting against the market, and we do not believe that benefiting such businesses’ interests alone will bring us any closer to security of supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we are debating the establishment of guidelines for trans-European energy networks. The decision we reach concerning these guidelines will determine the future development of a modern infrastructure for trans-European energy networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this short speech to highlight something that matters particularly to me, namely the decision to incorporate, for the first time, what are known as olefin gas pipelines into the trans-European energy networks. While I agree with the rapporteur that this is of great importance in terms of Europe’s success as an industrial and business location, the Commission proposal does have what I regard as the unfortunate disadvantage of not specifying individual stretches, and, on behalf of my group, I have tabled Amendment 39 in order to remedy this defect.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already some individual olefin gas networks in the European Union; they are to be found in the west of our continent and in the new Member States, but there is no link between the two. Amendment 39, which I will again take this opportunity of urging you to support, lists a number of selected stretches that could be used to bridge these gaps without delay and in a sustainable manner, thereby securing the supply of olefin gases and keeping our businesses viable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear – in view of the paucity of funds available – that not every project can be supported, and my amendment is not, indeed, concerned with financial support for the stretches named in it. My concern is that there should be a clear statement of policy and an indication that these stretches are of particular significance to the European Union and its Member States. It is for that reason that I again urge you to lend your support to Amendment 39 when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy brings synergy. The TEN-E networks in the energy sector will play an important role in the liberalisation of the internal market and in improving operational reliability, as they will enable the EU to connect to suppliers outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy networks should not, however, be treated in the same way as trans-European transport networks. Transport networks are part of the general infrastructure, whereas the TEN-E networks are in private ownership. Accordingly, public funds for the energy networks should be spent mainly on planning and research. In any case, this sum of money is so small for the Union’s energy networks that it will not be a critical factor when investment decisions are being made. A Coordinator would hardly be of any great value either: it would simply create a new organisational level once again. In matters of expertise just a little money should bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as certain details in the report are concerned, I am suspicious about mentioning the priority projects as proposed by the Commission. Their preparation has not been systematic: in practice it has been quite random. Do not let us emphasise the status of certain projects, then, but above all, the importance of Union-wide investigations into what we should invest in.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we all the while need to ensure that the operational reliability of energy does not lead to wastefulness, but savings. According to new estimates, all energy sources apart from renewables may run out within a few generations, depending on levels of consumption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should be very honest in looking at the trans-European networks in the energy field. It is clearly a necessity because the security of our energy supplies depends on our energy networks, and on interconnection as the most important part of it. When we speak about a competitive market, again interconnection is an absolute necessity. From this point of view, I cannot accept that there should be no policies at the European level. So the guidelines are clearly there to justify our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We spend EUR 20 million a year on trans-European energy networks. The money is for feasibility studies and perhaps in the future we can provide support for the projects. There have been advocates from the Baltic States for particular projects. At this stage it is clear, as one Member said, that the Baltic States are like an isolated island: there is no interconnection of electricity. There will be interconnection from Estonia to Finland. However, the PowerBridge Project between Lithuania and Poland will never be a reality unless there is Community support for trans-European networks in energy. I strongly advocate the approach we have delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning broader support for energy, we definitely need to diversify our supplies. For this reason we are working with all the countries and also with Azerbaijan, which I visited. No European company was involved, but we need to be involved from the beginning. Four countries have signed the Treaty. The Commission could not do so, but we are interested in this project because it concerns oil that that will be used by customers. We are interested in gas supplies but, at the same time, as we are not financing the project we cannot expect to take all the credit. Therefore, we are thinking about diversifying our security supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as I mentioned, the main sources of investment are from private investors. Therefore the private investors should invest in the project and the Commission, through these guidelines, should provide the necessary political input. So I am very grateful for today’s debate. We will continue our work. I wish to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns olefin and Amendment 39, I am sorry to say that at this stage the Commission simply notes the importance of olefin networks, without going into detail about the priority sections of this network, which will have to be assessed by the European Investment Bank for every specific proposal for financing. Therefore, the Commission does not propose a financing intervention by means of European Community money. For this reason, we cannot support Amendment 39. However, as I mentioned, the Commission’s and Parliament’s proposal are very close. I wish to thank Parliament again for its very close cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
