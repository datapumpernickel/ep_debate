<p class="contents">After two and a half years of negotiations and five presidencies which have given close attention to the matter, agreement has been reached in the Council on Regulation No 1408/1971, a particularly important regulation because it concerns the rights of workers in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jensen’s report precisely concerns Parliament’s position on the alignment of rights and the simplification of procedures relating to the workers of the European Union working and living in different places, and today we have the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is of exceptional importance for the rights of the insured. The proposal submitted by the Commission in June essentially reinforces the rights of the insured – all insured persons living temporarily in another Member State will have the same health care rights – but it also simplifies the procedures for safeguarding health care during temporary residency.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have a very specific act of the European institutions, which is understandable, clear and has an immediate impact on the daily life of European citizens. Essentially it touches on two fundamental matters in the European Union: the concept of the European citizen, on the one hand, and the right of free movement for workers, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above the significant independent operation of the regulation, however, and the simplification and reinforcement of workers’ rights, it will facilitate the introduction of the European Health Insurance Card which, as you know, will be ready on 1 June 2004, and it will significantly facilitate free movement in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I must make a point of congratulating Mrs Jensen who, with a deep knowledge of the subject and with creative flexibility, has managed to formulate Parliament’s position in relation to this proposal in a relatively short space of time, I would say in an exceptionally short space of time. With the very creative cooperation which there has been between the Commission and Parliament, perhaps we really shall find ourselves today before a decision which will be taken in record time, perhaps at first reading if there is ultimately agreement, and we shall have a final agreement between the three institutions on the regulation and its operation as quickly as possible. I would remind the House that essentially within six months, from June to today, there have been very important efforts, exceptionally creative collaboration, and I am very satisfied that the Commission can accept most of the amendments proposed by Parliament, because approval of these amendments will allow the Council to proceed to final approval, following the reading by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, very often, and also because of the nature of the institutions and how they operate, we concern ourselves a great deal with procedures, which are complicated. Today, with an end to procedures, with the agreement of the institutions, we essentially face a decision which has very specific and tangible repercussions on the lives of European citizens, even more so in a Europe of 25, in which the movement of workers, cooperation between the Member States, will need to be simplified and will need to be subject to much simpler and clearer procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking you very much for the cooperation we have enjoyed concerning the European Health Insurance Card, because what you say is correct, Commissioner. It is a real success story, as a result of which, with fairly few changes and a quite modest reform, we shall obtain very major benefits indeed for the individual citizen. I am pleased, moreover, that Parliament has supported our attaching importance to finishing the job quickly so that people might have the card in their hands by 1 July 2004. I believe it will have very great symbolic value indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not been as simple as all that, for it was as recently as last Friday that the Council agreed upon the wording now before us. I must thank my colleagues in the form of the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for having been so flexible and trusting in the work on this card and for having supported us in finding a solution as early as today, when I also hope we can lay the foundation for reaching an agreement at first reading and so having the proposal implemented in a mere six months.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are adopting today means that a number of the forms we have at present are to be replaced by a card. Initially, a simple form, called E111, is to be replaced. Subsequently, a number of other forms will follow, normally to be completed when people move from one country to another or need health insurance – paid for by their country of origin – when temporarily resident abroad. It will simplify matters and make things easier for people, including those who are travelling, in a host of practical ways. It is, then, not only students and retired people temporarily resident, or working in, another country, but also people travelling who will no doubt make more use of the new Health Insurance Card, for they will no longer have to contact the social authorities but will have the card and be able to go directly to the doctor’s.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, we are to be able to devise a card for all, everyone needs to be given the same rights, and this has meant some citizens being given more rights. In future, everyone will be entitled to all necessary medical treatment whereas, up until now, some people were only entitled to emergency medical treatment. In future, it will be the same for everyone, and this means, for example, that people suffering from chronic diseases, such as kidney diseases, will in future be able to come to an agreement with a hospital in the country to which they are travelling and be sure of being able to obtain dialysis. This proposal will therefore improve and simplify matters for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The tighter rules for the Health Insurance Card will be laid down by an administrative committee in which the individual Member States will be represented. How the rules will look and what list of illnesses it will be permitted, in purely practical terms, to obtain treatment for will be laid down by representatives from the Member States. What we are establishing here is a situation in which everyone is given the same rights and in which it is possible to go directly to the doctor without, therefore, having to do a tour of the social authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth mentioning that it will become easier to reimburse expenditure. This can be made simpler and faster. At present, it can take a long time before expenses are reimbursed. This will become simpler. It will become simpler for the individual, but it will also in fact become simpler for the doctors and health staff, as well as becoming easier for the authorities. The situation is therefore really one in which everyone can be pleased and elated about what is happening, because we shall, in actual fact, all benefit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say how very important it is to state that what we are preparing in this case is an insurance card and not a card providing health information in the general sense of the term. The only information to be carried on the card will be the person’s name and insurance details, but not health information. In the context of the e-Europe programme, work is being done on a card that will contain health information, but that is not what we are talking about today. We do not therefore have data protection problems, because the data that is to be exchanged by means of this Health Insurance Card is exclusively the same data we exchange by means of forms. It is a small reform but one that, I believe, will be very effective in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission had officially launched the idea of creating a European health card at the beginning of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, which ran from January to June 2002, at the informal meeting of Employment and Social Policy Ministers, held in Burgos on 18 and 19 January 2002. That proposal was supported by the then Spanish Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, President-in-Office of the Council of Employment and Social Policy Ministers, Mr Juan Carlos Aparicio Pérez, who is incidentally now the Mayor of that beautiful Castilian city.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, the Barcelona Council of March 2002 decided to create a European Health Insurance Card, a card which will replace the current paper forms which European citizens require in order to receive healthcare assistance in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When Community citizens move between Member States there may be, and in fact there are, inconveniences and restrictions of their intra-Community freedom of movement. The possibility – an immediate one, having heard the Commissioner – of a European health card must contribute to the elimination and removal of these difficulties and furthermore is going to make it easier for Community Europeans to exercise their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation was very different initially, since we were working on the basis of differing situations in each of the Member States. Nevertheless, the advantages of this European health card are obvious. For my country, which receives more than 40 million European citizens per year and in which furthermore many Community citizens take up residence, it is very important. The inhabitants of highly regionalised countries will also have special advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">The card for all Community Europeans is going to simplify the procedures currently necessary in order to receive assistance in the country of temporary stay, also guaranteeing that the bodies funding that assistance are reimbursed for their expenses by the country of origin of the beneficiary-user.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the advantages, amongst others, are the correct application of Community coordination in the field of health care; creating confidence amongst the European citizens with regard to their healthcare when they move within Community territory; to facilitate the citizens’ exercise of their right to healthcare assistance by means of simplifying the documentation required, concentrating it in a simple card, in a single card to ensure healthcare assistance, with the integrated use of cards and terminals; and finally, the provision of the replacement procedure in exceptional cases, by which I mean the loss or theft of the card.</p>
<p class="contents">With this card, which in principle is going to replace the current E111 form, used for short stays, as the Commissioner said, we will have another piece of Europe in our pockets to add to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite simply, to return to the Spanish Presidency and its slogan, this card will provide us with ‘more Europe’. In any event, I believe that ‘more Europe’ means a closer Europe, closer to the European citizens, which the citizens will have a better image of, and, undoubtedly – and I will end here, Madam President – a further step in European construction as our precursors would have said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the fast and flexible work and, above all, for the excellent cooperation with the political groups. I am also indebted to the Council for its positive attitude in this matter. Commissioner, we are really witnessing a small miracle here: a Regulation that has to be approved by the Council unanimously in codecision with Parliament, the procedure of which is completed within the space of one reading. I do not think that this has ever happened before in this Parliament. Yet, the Regulation we are discussing today is very important, as it considerably enhances, in two ways, the rights of citizens who utilise the right to free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, from now on, everyone will enjoy the same rights to essential medical care, which is a vast improvement for a huge number of people. So far, students and retired people have been entitled to medical care in the Member States in which they reside, if required, while employees and their families can only obtain essential care in those countries. This discrimination has therefore now been lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the procedures will also become much simpler for the public. At present, persons residing in a different Member State must take their E111 forms to the local health insurance fund, whereupon they obtain new forms, and only then can they visit the GP or dentist. This is hopelessly complicated. At least now, they are allowed to go to the care-provider directly. That too is a vast improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am also pleased that the Council and Commission have agreed to the principle of Member States having to inform their citizens about their entitlements to health care, for these are naturally not unlimited.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I share the hope of my fellow MEPs that this Regulation will indeed be a important new step towards the introduction of a general European Health Insurance Card which will provide ready access to health care throughout Europe for all insured Europeans who enjoy rights of residence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In effect, the introduction of a European Health Insurance Card, which will replace the current paper forms needed for health treatment in another Member State, constitutes a considerable advance for Europeans. I think that we should all be aware of this. The harmonisation of procedures will lead to greater well-being, it will avoid people being confronted by endless paperwork, but above all it will give real mobility to European citizens. This step is an excellent example of the efficacy that can result from a reorganisation of procedures. Thus the famous Form E111, so familiar to tourists and required for short-term stays, will be the first thing to be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">The European card will simplify the lives of our fellow citizens, without changing existing rights and obligations. This is something that we all insisted on. This practical and very visible act will increase our sense of belonging to the European Union, just as it will strengthen European citizenship. It is clear that we shall very quickly have to continue our efforts and broaden the scope of the card, so that it includes medical emergency data and information about the health of the holder.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, let us welcome this new administrative culture which, without a doubt, will be appreciated by the citizens of Europe, who have all too often been disappointed by the slow and cumbersome nature of our procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These rights need to be extended to as many people as possible, and therefore it is a positive step that a European health card has been successfully created for everyone who travels, studies or works – and also for their family members – in any European Union Member State, thus replacing the forms that currently exist, but without containing data that might put their privacy at risk. I also consider it a positive step to provide all citizens with information on the rights they enjoy in this field in the various Member States and that this should be duly guaranteed. I therefore congratulate Mrs Jensen on the work she has done. I hope that the citizens of the various Member States of the European Union will indeed gain direct access to full health care and that this will happen as soon as possible, according to an established timetable. I also hope that today’s vote will help to ensure that this timetable is adhered to and that the health card will become a reality during the coming year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed a breakthrough for our citizens and a concrete example to them of the way that the European Union can be of direct benefit. For example, instead of having to collect an E111 form before travelling, and then having to go through various bureaucratic procedures before receiving care, they will, through the card, have immediate access to the care they need.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have the responsibility for health, and there is, of course, a great diversity of approaches in this area.

<p class="contents">The rapporteur is correct, however, in pointing out that the European Parliament must be consulted again if an extension of the card to include personal medical data is proposed – indeed, this has already been suggested – as the proper protection of personal information – particularly of a medical nature – is a major concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In one sense it helps to promote the ideal of European Union integration and greater mobility between the Member States when we think that a short time ago we had difficulty in agreeing a common format for a passport. There was even greater difficulty in agreeing some form of common format with regard to a design for a coin or for a bank note when the euro came into being.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for many years, through the E111 form or other forms, we have had an agreement with regard to the ability to deliver services to people who are unwell when they are away from their home Member State. The biggest difficulty with the format of the form was that it was too bureaucratic and there was no certainty or guarantee that you would get the standard of care that you required – or even get any care – when you were struck by an illness or a certain medical condition while you were away. This single card will at least eliminate a lot of those difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the agreements between the Member States – regarding the types of care, and the range and level of services that will be available to people – will also help to clarify the situation for many people.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and more importantly, it will also give a great sense of security to people who are moving abroad whether for a holiday, for work or for any other reason. The figures pertaining to this matter are interesting. Since 1970, the number of people within the existing 15 European Union Member States living outside their home Member State has risen by 61%. The number of people within the European Union who work outside their home Member State has increased by 54% since 1970. The number of students who are studying away from their home Member State has increased by 71% since 1970. This illustrates that the necessity for the delivery of services is even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to ensure that doctors in the Member States understand what these cards mean, a training or advertising programme should be put in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to promote free movement in the European Union and to create the conditions for this. If we want to promote the free movement of persons and wish to achieve further integration of the internal market, a solution will need to be found for the not-so-pleasant things in life too – like calling on health care abroad. This solution is now within reach with the introduction of a European Health Insurance Card. Alongside the clear advantages, however, I can also see a few objections to introducing a card of this kind. In her report, Mrs Jensen mentioned two measures that are required for such a card.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the harmonisation of the rights of all categories of insured persons. I do not share this wish for harmonisation. The way in which health care systems are run is different is every Member State, and the funding too varies from premiums to paying for it out of tax money. In addition, I do not consider the symbolic value of such a card to be of vital importance. After all, when you become ill abroad, you need care, not a symbol. You will soon be able to receive the care with a card. I certainly have no European sentiment in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I do approve, though, of the second measure, which should lead to the simplification of formalities. Administrative procedures and formalities must be reduced to a minimum. The fact that increased mobility among citizens leads to them calling on health care in another Member State should not be penalised by red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off my contribution with a question to Commissioner Diamantopoulou. Will the card that is yet to be introduced also need to be introduced and issued by new official bodies, or would that be possible without any new bodies or staff? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will be a great step towards achieving this fundamental objective. In the Barcelona conclusions of March 2002, it had been agreed to create a European health card as a means of removing the barriers to geographical mobility. Facilitating the free movement of people in the European Union is thus the objective. Supporting this report now is a necessary condition for us all to benefit from this step forward for the Community in 2004. I congratulate Mrs Jensen, the rapporteur, on the good work she has done. I also applaud the Commission for its diligence and commitment in putting this ambition into practice, as well as the highly positive collaboration of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will result in a harmonisation of the rights of insured people and their family members whether they are travelling, studying or posted abroad, or are job-seekers or international road transport drivers. All citizens will be entitled to benefits in kind when seeking medical care during their stay in a Member State, and will avoid the complicated bureaucratic process that currently involves the intervention of various different bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to create the environment needed for the adoption of this card, the regulations implementing social security schemes, namely Regulations No 1408/71 and No 572/72, must first be amended. I am pleased to note the agreement reached with the Council on the revision of Regulation No 1408/71. With the adoption of this single, personalised document, the various forms currently in use will be eliminated, the rights of the insured will be harmonised and formalities simplified. Eliminating the existing forms will, however, take place in stages. Such changes mean that the insured must be properly informed on their rights and duties deriving from the new legislation and it will be up to the Member States to ensure that their citizens are given this information. The creation of the European Health Insurance Card is, therefore, an ambition that has become reality, but it is also a symbol of Europe and a tool that strengthens the feeling of belonging to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wonderful! I should nevertheless like to take this opportunity to make a few remarks. It is, of course, marvellous that we will have this permit next year, but I think that these things are sometimes done all too hastily. Health care is not simply a commercial product or service that is traded within the free market. You cannot simply regard those who make use of health care as ordinary individual consumers, and those who provide the care as companies and self-employed people who carry out their jobs on the market 'for-or-not-for-profit'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States’ systems for dealing with health costs within social security systems that are largely funded collectively and on the basis of solidarity between those in poor health and those in good health, young and old, men and women and, to a certain extent, the rich and the poor. These systems are currently under a great deal of strain on account of an ageing population, increasing medical possibilities, privatisation and other trends, and I would ask the Commission to pay greater attention to all of them. It is absolutely inadequate only to regulate the free movement of medical care for individual cardholders and for Europe to seek to intervene in health care only by way of rulings by the Court of Justice and through the new directive on the free movement of services that is now being put together by the DG Market. We must not allow the solidarity element to be eroded. It is not our intention to encourage calculating citizens who can afford it to shop around for health care, while care at home is being fleeced. I cannot go into all of this in the two minutes that I have been allocated now, but I should like to alert you to this and to add that, however successful the health insurance card may be, there is an urgent need for the so-called high-level reflection process that was initiated by the Council last year, to culminate in the firm, fully-fledged coordination of health care in which solidarity and quality aspects occupy centre stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These adjustments will help to speed up the implementation of the policy of the European Union, of the capitalist reforms in the Members States, on the pretext of harmonising health systems, by which we mean levelling social benefits downwards, abolishing the public nature and privatising and commercialising the health and social security systems, reducing pensions and increasing workers’ contributions to insurance funds. All this signals an attack on the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">What good will the card be when access to the national health system is becoming more and more problematic and the privilege of the right to care remains with those who can afford to pay, given that even national health hospitals are operating on business criteria? Insurance funds are in the red because the state is drawing resources from the social security funds in order to finance the money markets and help out employers by reducing employer contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed measures will probably make the financial situation of the insurance funds worse. When social security is privatised, what sort of insurance will there be for the 20% of the population of the European Union living below the poverty line and the 8.8% unemployed, according to the recent Eurostat study?</p>
<p class="contents">So the workers have nothing to expect from the much-publicised insurance card. On the contrary, they can expect greater insecurity, poverty and increased payments in order to have preventive health protection and care. We are certain that they will fight to overturn these policies. We, the Communist Party of Greece, stand by their side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As from 2004, this card will also be electronic, and it will be possible to read data off it.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a Health Insurance card is, of course, extremely welcome. It will make it significantly simpler for people in the various Member States of the European Union to have their social rights safeguarded without administrative worries. The various forms will now disappear, firstly the E111 form and, subsequently, the others too: E110, E119 and E128.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is important to emphasise that this new European Health Insurance Card does not provide any new social rights. It is only an administrative simplification. In the future too, it will, on a purely constitutional basis, be the Member States that are responsible for health care within the European Union. Responsibility for payment also lies with the Member States. It is important for us in the European debate to see social rights as being linked to issues of solidarity and responsibility for payment.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that, today in many EU Member States, there is an economic crisis within the health and social insurance systems. The objective of harmonisation, or of creating a European catalogue of social rights without linking this to funding by the Member States, is very dubious. We must make matters easier from an administrative point of view, but we must allow the Member States themselves to deal with these issues in the future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Administrative simplification is very important, as other Members have pointed out, but I would also take this opportunity to say that for the first time we are modifying the old Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and we are beginning to talk not just about the free movement of workers in Europe, but also the free movement of citizens, and we are beginning to organise a discussion and political practice in which the right to European citizenship begins to become a reality in relation to such fundamental elements as the right to health. It is therefore an extremely important first step of a strategic nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say, Madam President, that this success and the congratulations we are all offering must not lead us to be complacent: we must continue to be demanding because this is simply a first step. We do not yet have a European card. This is a simplification of forms; the card is not yet an intelligent card, there are still many steps to take before the right to health for all Europeans is truly guaranteed, coordinated and justified by a Community authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Commissioner, that we must continue to make progress; this is the first step, as I have said, in a long battle to make the social Europe more administratively simple, but also more profound and more serious in terms of our status as citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank them because there have never before been so many Members as there are today to hear me. I am infinitely grateful to you all.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you that I dreamt that Mr Berlusconi came into the Chamber at the end of December to report on the work done during this term-in-office in Europe. In the dream, Mr Schultz stood up once again and, turning to Mr Berlusconi, said: ‘Mr Berlusconi, what would you do if you fell ill when travelling in Europe, for example here in France?’ Hearing this, Mr Berlusconi grasped his genitals – as we do in Italy – to ward off danger and then said: ‘Mr dear Mr Schultz, I will go a great deal further than this Commission Charter, which is already significant. When Italy has the Presidency of the Council and I am President-in-Office again in thirteen and a half years’ time, I will endeavour to ensure that all the citizens can travel throughout Europe to receive treatment for all illnesses. Remember, therefore, to vote for this document and to show my satisfaction for this wonderful health Charter’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should bear in mind, as the Commissioner has pointed out, that it has taken two and a half years to get to this point through negotiations with five presidencies. Nevertheless, this is a tangible reality for citizens of Europe. It is a tangible way of bringing Europe closer to the citizens and I would support the view that this card should, in fact, have a European logo and should be very clearly identified as a European benefit for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The forms that it is replacing – E111, E128, E110, and E119 – sound more like food additives than health passports, but I am pleased that this card will now replace those in good time.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to stress what the Commissioner said: this is a tangible benefit making free movement a reality for ordinary EU citizens. While congratulating the rapporteur, I should also like to ask – if this card is to become a reality – that the Commission and all MEPs stress to Member State governments that they must not see this merely as a technical step forward. Advertising is needed, and, as Mr Crowley said, proper training for doctors so that they accept the health card and ensure that this is seen as the success story that it so obviously is.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very few criticisms here. Let us go out and publicise the fact that the health card is a benefit that makes free movement, as set out in the Treaties, something of a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was an agreement, and we all agree that we have a success story here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to simplify the procedures, so I should like to assure you that there will be no new institution responsible for issuing the card, no new services or new people. The same people in the Commission will go on dealing with the issue, and the Member States will continue with the same procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the card is concerned, I should like to clarify that the European Health Insurance Card is not a health card like others we know in certain Member States. It does not contain the information concerning the health status of the cardholder.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting that we now have a regulation which is clear, simple and which facilitates the everyday life of workers in the European Union. The extent of the differences between the Member States' health systems meant that it was not an easy issue to agree on, but in the end – thanks to the consensus and to the political will coming from the Member States – we have agreed on this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the procedures. I believe this agreement answers some of those voices at European level that claim that Europe is becoming more and more complicated. They say it is very difficult to agree on complicated social issues, but here, 15 Member States with different social protection systems have agreed and now we have a common single regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns not only the substance but the symbolism of the European card. As many Members of Parliament have already said, the European citizens will have the euro in one pocket and the European health card in the other pocket: a real symbol of social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jensen has done an excellent job and I should like to congratulate her again. It was not easy to strike a balance and achieve an agreement on all sides of Parliament. The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 34. In the light of the agreement, Amendments Nos 1 to 7 are no longer applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that now, after Parliament's first reading, it will be possible to adopt the regulation before the end of the Italian presidency.</p>
