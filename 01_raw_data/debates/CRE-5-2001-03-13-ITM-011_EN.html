We shall then have to vote on the draft legislative resolution and a favourable vote is needed to inform the Council that we have rejected its initiative. It is complicated, but it is the same as the situation which arose at the previous plenary sitting and was explained by Mr Watson. That is to say, the next amendment does not fall.

The system has got nothing to do with the market, it is more like something from a planned economy, a combination of production quotas, minimum prices, import tariffs and export subsidies. All in all, this is not something we should commend, it is something we should criticise, especially as it is downright expensive for the European taxpayer. The Member States allocate specific regions and quotas to the sugar manufacturers and this sugar is then sold within a protected national market. You have to bear in mind that 100 kg of white sugar cost EUR 28 on the world market and that the intervention price, the European Union's guaranteed price, is EUR 65. This is too expensive and it is bad for EU consumers and sugar processors. This is not a sustainable solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we regret that our amendment, which aimed to correct the injustice committed by the Commission in allocating Portugal's quota, has been rejected. Our current quota is just 70 000 tonnes, and the total production rights allocated to growers represent just 20% of the country's consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the economic viability of the only sugar beet processing plant in mainland Portugal, in Coruche, could be jeopardised if it does not reach an output close to 100 000 tonnes. An increase of 30 000 tonnes has therefore been proposed. This adjustment would create a level playing field for Portuguese growers and would guarantee the sustainability of sugar beet production, which in any case can and should be increased when the Alqueva dam comes into operation.</p>

More importantly, this report rejects improvement in management of the sugar regime of which one small measure was the Commission proposal for the abolition of the storage levy.</p>
<p class="contents">My opposition to reinstating the storage levy scheme is based on three factors. First, the storage levy is passed on to consumers. Abolishing the system, therefore, will mean that sugar manufacturers will bear the storage costs. Second, the abolition of the storage levy scheme will inject an element of competition into the highly distorted market. This will benefit the sugar-using industry and consumers as well as enabling observers to evaluate the effects of limited competition on the EU sugar sector. Finally, the budgetary resources allocated to the system (EUR 300 million per annum) could be redirected towards other agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principal concern about this report is that Daul's amendments extended the current regime until 2005-6 contrary to the Commission's proposal of an interim regime lasting 2 years. I am opposed to another five year roll-over. The momentum for reform is mounting. EU sugar prices are 2.5-3 times the world level. Such a system threatens to jeopardise the EU's credibility in relation to impending enlargement and WTO obligations. This report also ignores the conclusions of a recent Court of Auditor's report denouncing the regime as wasteful and mismanaged and stating that the current system leads to substantial costs for the EU budget and consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of empathy and support for the farming industry, and I know that many of them recognise that serious and considered reform is necessary to ensure that the sugar sector is prepared for the demands of the future. By contrast, the consequences of another roll-over would be deeper and deeper quota cuts, which would shrink the base of EU industry and lead to unemployment. Similarly, artificially high prices cannot be sustained. They are detrimental to the sugar-using industry and the consumer, and a degree of competition must be incrementally introduced in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the further areas of concern was that comprehensive studies were undertaken to evaluate viable alternatives to the current regime which take into consideration the impact on producers and consumers in order to enable the Commission to draw up more detailed proposals for further reform of the sugar regime on the basis of these reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, the amendments tabled by Mr Mulder (ELDR Group) might well mean that the European agricultural policy is finally looked at. Although we cannot agree on the content of the current sugar policy, we have voted in favour of the amended report because, more than anything, policy is about keeping prior arrangements, as in the case of Agenda 2000. We should, however, like to underline that the evaluation, with the possible reviews in 2003, should very much take place. In our opinion, it is wrong just to talk about reviews and subsequently delay the decision-making process, which will ultimately lead to a decline in social support for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The present European agricultural policy is no longer appropriate to our times. The era of firm product subsidisation will, in the short term, need to be replaced by another system. The landscape, for which the agricultural sector is largely responsible, will need to be maintained, and we can imagine that a compensatory income will be provided for this. The European citizens will understand this.</p>

<p class="contents">I find the Commission's dose of sugar market reforms much sweeter to swallow. Reform of the sugar market is crucial to tackle over production and high prices on the EU market. Moreover, it is necessary to comply with WTO rules. It is important for European consumers and for the European taxpayer. I want to see the production quota cut by 115 000 tonnes each year and to abolish the reimbursement of storage cuts. Drastic changes are needed in 2003 when the Commission will review the cereal, oilseeds and dairy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make cuts in the agricultural budget which is in dire need of reform. The bottom line is that the common agricultural policy must be radically overhauled and reformed. We waste far too much of the taxpayer's money on this budget and we must look carefully at restructuring and reforming our agricultural policy across the EU.</p>

Contrary to what some speakers alleged during the debate, it is not aimed at turning the carriers into border police, since they obviously do not have the means of checking the authenticity of the residence and travel permits of the people they transport. In fact, this proposal provides for penalties only in the case of illegal immigrants who have no documents whatsoever, and that is clearly something a carrier would have to take note of.</p>
<p class="contents">Following its usual strategy, the European Parliament began by voting for amendments that completely destroy the balance of the proposal. In particular, it has exempted carriers from any penalties if an illegal passenger seeks asylum immediately after arriving on the territory of the country of destination. That derogation is unacceptable, for it is common knowledge that the majority of applications for asylum are unfounded and just made to gain time. At a pinch, one could consider refunding a fine already levied on a carrier if a passenger does, in fact, obtain asylum. But it is difficult to go further than that without inflating the number of applications for asylum made for reasons of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">After upsetting the balance of the text in this way, the European Parliament then rejected it, expressing its annoyance that Member States were presenting such 'repressive' texts, on the basis of the right of initiative they still have, for the time being, in this area. We, on the contrary, thought the proposal for a Council directive deserves to be followed up, since the European Parliament, fortunately, only has a consultative role here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal was designed to prevent the tragedies that result from the actions of unscrupulous carriers who are prepared to exploit human distress and misery. I welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I think it is high time we tackled this problem head-on, to avoid any repetition of the tragedies of Dover and Saint Raphaël.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this directive is to supplement Article 26 of the Schengen Convention and to define its implementing conditions. This French initiative defines the obligations of carriers who bring foreigners whose application for asylum has been rejected into the Union. It proposes harmonising the penalties, which currently differ widely from one country to another, imposed on carriers who have not respected their obligation to carry out checks.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I am disappointed by the Swedish Presidency’s text, which steps back from the original text drawn up at the initiative of France. It is confined to improving the situation in only a very limited way within the actual scope of Article 26 of the Schengen Agreement, although, pursuant to the Protocol integrating the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the framework of the European Union, a far more significant step forward could have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">This lack of ambition is apparent when we consider the scope of the text. It does not apply to international rail traffic and it does not precisely define the obligations and financial penalties, which consist of a deterrent penalty of not less than EUR 2 000 per person.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the exemptions from the penalties are not acceptable. For instance, the text provides that the carrier is not liable for any penalty if the third-country national seeks asylum immediately after arriving in the territory of the State of destination, even if the application is subsequently turned down. It should surely be up to the State and not the carrier to check the asylum seeker's eligibility. In the same context, the carrier is exempted from the penalties if the person carried is granted refugee status or leave to remain under a subsidiary form of protection.</p>

<p class="contents">It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that traffickers do not profit. Several of my colleagues and I have been to Calais and seen what goes on there. I have witnessed first hand the very casual attitude of many of the lorry drivers and their companies. These carriers must do more – they must properly check all vehicles and all modes of transport to try to avoid another Dover-type tragedy. All the companies who own the lorries and other vehicles and all carriers of all types must take responsibility for their actions – corporate responsibility from the top downwards.</p>

The Council’s initiative is another in the series of fragmented proposals aimed only at excluding people from entering the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, it is unthinkable that the Member States’ responsibility for checking passports should be transferred to private transport companies. It is unfair that check-in staff at airports and at harbours, air stewardesses or ticket collectors should instead be given the right to decide who should be granted entry to the European Union. That is precisely what the result will be if the rules of the Schengen Convention and Mr Kirkhope’s proposal regarding penalties are put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to asylum under the Geneva Convention must be a cornerstone both of Schengen cooperation and of the EU’s common refugee and immigration policy.

But it is also a misconception to think that we can keep Fort Europe closed to people who have to, or want to, leave the world outside Europe. It appears that those people are willing to part with a great deal of money and take huge risks to enter Europe. We will only change this if we help improve the world outside of Europe, for example by not dragging cheap raw materials and semi-finished products from those regions and by not doing business with oppressive regimes. Imposing minimum fines undermines the autonomy of the Member States in terms of their criminal law, and the prescribed increase from EUR 3 000 to 5 000 only makes matters worse. The Kirkhope proposal will only lead to more illegal migration and to higher profits for the mafia. That is what you get when you punish idealistic helpers and cut off legal access options. As I already said on 15 February in the context of the Ceyhun report on illegal entry, it is crazy to penalise the solidarity of action groups and churches with political refugees and war victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Illegal immigration and human trafficking is a key issue for the European Union, and we must work together to tackle this challenge. Whilst there is, of course, a strong case for genuine asylum seekers applying through the usual routes, the influx of illegal immigrants being smuggled into British ports, often by people-trafficking gangs, is alarming. We need to send a strong signal to the traffickers that no matter where they operate in Europe, the penalties they face will be harsh. The response to the UK-Italian proposal for EU teams of police and immigration officers to work in the western Balkans has therefore been encouraging. Truck drivers must be part of this operation and carry out thorough checks on their vehicles to ensure there is nobody on board.</p>
<p class="contents">More disturbing, however, are the atrocious conditions that these immigrants suffer on their journey on trucks and lorries. Of course, the victims, arguably, are prepared to take drastic risks to enter the countries of the European Union. We should therefore be also looking at the root causes of this displacement, whether it is persecution in their home countries, poverty or other reasons. All of us are extremely fortunate to be living in prosperous, democratic countries, and I for one, certainly hope we can open our doors to those who do not live in such fortunate circumstances. These are simply common-sense measures that will help prevent people being smuggled into countries across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Labour government is carrying out measures to speed up applications for asylum-seekers and is making the system fairer and faster, so that people will be encouraged to make official applications rather than risk their lives on lorries, ships and trains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had already set out serious objections during the debate and now the European Parliament's amendments have only made matters worse, as, incidentally, have the explanations given by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the proposal for a directive seemed to recognise the fact that a Member State cannot have a quota of refugees imposed on it against its will. However, Commissioner Vitorino has just presented the situation quite differently. According to him, Article 25 does indeed provide that a Member State can declare itself unable to take in these persons, but it will have to justify that declaration and the justification must be genuinely exceptional.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, he pointed out that the decision to introduce the temporary protection system was taken by a qualified majority, implying that a Member State that declared itself unable to take in refugees could not have a right of veto. The European Parliament went even further by adopting amendments that make it totally impossible for a Member State to dissociate itself from a majority decision on the physical allocation of these refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Parliament endorsed the Commission's proposals on organising the situation of temporary refugees as though they were to remain in the host country for good, in particular by accepting the right of families to be reunited.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that every Member State must remain master of its own territory, that it cannot have the presence of unwanted foreigners imposed on it, and that while there may be cases where it is necessary to give temporary protection, it must be given mainly with an eye to the repatriation of the persons concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who welcome the progress of globalisation but wish to add a social dimension to its economic component must not forget that the movement of goods also means the movement of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrival on the French coast on 19 January of a group of 910 Kurdish refugees clearly illustrates the growing involvement of networks of organised crime in illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, this massive influx of refugees quite plainly raises the question of the right to seek asylum on European soil today. It highlights the existence right inside our borders of real trafficking in human beings, which, according to some experts, is approaching the scale of the traffic in drugs. This can be discouraged only by the establishment of genuine channels of legal access to immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisation of legal immigration channels in Europe would tangibly reduce the pressure put on the right of asylum by the fact that it is really the only one that exists, together with the right of persons persecuted in their country of origin to be reunited with their family. Under the 1951 Geneva Convention, the right to seek asylum is indeed a fundamental and inalienable individual right that needs to be strengthened and protected from any political considerations. It needs to be strengthened because refugees face more than just state persecution and because very often it is not just individuals who are targeted but whole families.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us today seems to tend broadly in that direction, yet the measures it advocates are very limited in terms of achieving the objectives involved in implementing a genuine common European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time Europe considered establishing a legal status of temporary protection for people who flee their country because of war or other crises. It must be a status that does not bar them from access to an asylum procedure and a status that maintains due regard for the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in the Geneva Convention, under which refugees may not be sent back to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the European Union to genuinely overhaul the right of asylum without further delay, for the situations in which the displaced people find themselves are too urgent and serious to allow time for institutional discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of this proposal is, quite patently, to make it easier to take measures to expel third-country nationals. To that end, it introduces an instrument for the mutual recognition of these decisions. Accordingly, an expulsion decision taken in one Member State can be enforced in another.</p>
<p class="contents">At first sight it may seem quite laudable to try to regulate and control the movement of foreigners whom our Member States have decided to expel. This would be in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, aimed at better migration management. Careful examination, however, soon shows up the total ambiguity and imprecise nature of this initiative and the legal loopholes it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that it is high time the European Union countries adopted a genuine immigration policy, what are we to think of a document that not only does not regulate expulsion issues at all, but which also seems to show complete disregard for the real situations faced by people?</p>
<p class="contents">To address the immigration problem also means this: to dare to look at these non-Community citizens threatened with expulsion or being expelled who, having entered the closely-guarded Schengen area, find themselves battling against recalcitrant administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wishes to be and remain an area of freedom, justice and security, it will have to adopt legal instruments that are not only effective but also take the human factor into account. Not measures which, like this initiative, are basically aimed only at establishing a security policy under which foreigners, perceived as a threat, can no longer enjoy their rights and freedoms and the word justice has become meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is difficult to accept the legal basis chosen for this proposal, namely Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty. That article is concerned only with immigration measures taken in specific circumstances, and in particular the conditions under which a third-country national can be sent back or expelled, against his will, to his country of origin. The present proposal for a directive does not address these matters. It is confined simply to the mutual recognition of decisions already taken. The proposal does not, therefore, set out to lay down Community rules on expulsion.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be dangerous to adopt an initiative of this kind to tackle an issue as sensitive as immigration. Any rules adopted in this regard must respect the humanitarian and universalist values that underpin Europe. Otherwise, our Community policies would become meaningless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The official checks the cargo: it is radioactive material, all in order with all the necessary permits. When the official, who works in the centre of Düsseldorf, a densely populated German city, realises the risk posed by the consignment of radioactive material, he asks the driver, “But why did you go right through Düsseldorf, where there are so many people? Couldn't you have taken a longer, more isolated route? These goods are highly dangerous”. “Well Sir,” replies the driver, “do you not know that, this very day, the European Parliament has adopted the report tabled by Mr Hatzidakis – who is a very great, extremely important, very good MEP – Paragraph 2 (page 8) of which calls upon the Member States to apply the shortest possible distance principle to shipments of nuclear material. Therefore, I took the shortest route for my consignment of radioactive material.” And this leads me to state that something needs changing: it is better to take a long, safer route than a short, dangerous one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment. Ionising radiation transfers energy at levels that can induce changes in any matter it penetrates and even cause irreversible damage to human cells.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger is linked to duration of exposure and intensity and type of radiation with a dose equal to or exceeding 10 000mSv (millisieverts) death occurs almost instantaneously (such high doses have only been reached in nuclear weapons explosions or serious accidents in nuclear power stations). Radiation can also have delayed effects, as determined in particular after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the form of cancers or hereditary damage. Persons exposed to radiation levels of 200mSv or more are subject to an increased risk of cancer. This means that inhaling a few micrograms of plutonium can cause lung or tongue cancer. Similarly, dispersal of 1200g of powdered plutonium would deliver lethal doses of radiation by inhalation with a radius of more than 2 km.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of nuclear proliferation is greater during transportation than at any other stage in the fuel cycle. Convoys are not immune to terrorist attack aimed at stealing the packages containing highly radioactive substances. Only a few kilograms of separated plutonium are needed to build a crude nuclear explosive device. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was not what the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism intended. The debate on the pros and cons of nuclear energy takes place first and foremost in each of the Member States, where it follows its own course. This report concentrates on the question of transport as such, and its different aspects: rationalisation, compliance with legislative provisions concerning transport, information on the transport of radioactive material, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Radioactive material is regularly transported over long distances, not only within the European Union but also to and from the European Union and other continents. Although a number of European Union Member States have decided to stop reprocessing or gradually to 'go non-nuclear', it will still be necessary to send consignments to those countries which have signed reprocessing contracts, in order to return to them their nuclear waste currently stored at reprocessing facilities. The increase in consignments generally and the frequency of the use of road, rail, waterway and air transport increase both the likelihood of accidents and<span class="bold"> </span>the need for safety standards in the transportation of radioactive material. Safety must have absolute priority over profitability and supply, which is why the nuclear industry must strictly abide by international transport regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these observations, I support the committee's call on the Commission to draw up a detailed list of consignments of radioactive material within the European Union and at its borders and to assess their economic and social justification, particularly in terms of public health. This should be done in order to propose means of rationalising such consignments and curtailing their number and volume, in the light of the risks identified, in compliance with the principle of prevention, if the risks are proven to outweigh the benefits. Moreover, the Member States concerned must apply the shortest possible distance principle to all shipments of nuclear material and, as far as possible, avoid transit through densely populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by emphasising the importance of transparency in this field. Full information on the risks involved needs to be very widely disseminated on a continuous basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, what is hard to grasp politically in this case is the way this has happened. If groups abandon jointly negotiated compromise proposals literally overnight and suddenly put in writing the opposite of their original statements, then that casts some doubt on the very seriousness of this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is, of course, aware that a report on the transportation of radioactive materials is not a report on nuclear power as such, but the best way to maximise safety would be if there were nothing to transport. So in this context we are bound to mention keeping output and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel rods to a minimum. The fact that only 5% or around 75 000 consignments are involved in the nuclear fuel cycle says something not only about the scale of the potential risk, but also about the nature of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard it as incomprehensible that a proposal for a legislative initiative on uniform standards for transporting radioactive materials within the European Union and at its borders, whilst observing the principle of subsidiarity, should be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we understand why stricter checks on compliance with legislation on the transportation of dangerous goods should be unacceptable.

A number of countries subsequently built nuclear power stations as if there were no tomorrow, and the electricity supply was made largely dependent on nuclear fission. The 1960s saw the beginning of mounting criticism, especially when it transpired that nuclear power stations can explode and that the waste product continues to threaten the environment for a very long period of time. The disasters in Harrisburg and Chernobyl had a decelerating effect on the further development of nuclear energy, and some countries have either abandoned it completely by now or are in the process of doing so. But even after that, we will be facing dangerous radioactive waste for many thousands of years. Given the risks involved in transporting this kind of waste, the best solution is to bury it in the nuclear power stations which are condemned for closure and not to transport it to another location. There are many campaigns to stop these transports, and rightly so. The rapporteur is showing some degree of understanding for those campaigns and wants to curb the risks, but continues to allow and justify further transport of this kind. I do not subscribe to this point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The demonstrations, which were attended by demonstrators from all over the world, were a decisive factor in bringing down the talks. At the same time, the opposing positions and antagonisms within this world imperialist system cause difficulties and delays which the popular movement can turn to its advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO, which was set up in order to speed up the full liberalisation of trade, is one of the mainstays of the new world order. Not only does it support globalisation, it endeavours to give it the form and substance of law, which is why we do not believe that the governments of the European Union will defend the interests of their people during the new round of talks. On the contrary, they will endeavour to claim an even bigger stake for the European monopolies, in competition with the two other imperialist centres, the USA and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-aired European agriculture model defended in the Schwaiger report is born of a compromise which prejudices small and medium-sized European farms and Mediterranean farm produce. Its direct outcome will be lower farmers’ incomes, less farming and higher unemployment. Agricultural production in Greece and other countries is being sacrificed in order to protect industrial produce from central and northern Europe and ensure that it gains a stronger foothold on the international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve the interests of the workers, leave fundamental social rights be, help less-developed countries to develop, respect the environment and serve the right of every nation to exercise its own controls and decide on its own future.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what is maintained in the Schwaiger report, the WTO will not be democratised by having elected national delegates attend. Democratisation presupposes respect for and the protection of the rights of the workers. The WTO, by its very nature, cannot operate in this way because it is an imperialist structure and it is concerned solely with maximum profits for big business and the safest and most flexible ways of moving money around, especially money from trade and the stock exchange, without hindrance.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Schwaiger report because most of it goes along with the plans of big business on unbridled neo-liberalisation, with its attack on the achievements of workers and the rights of nations throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The movement against ‘globalisation’ and the WTO, its disparate and multi-faceted nature notwithstanding, is an initial counterattack on the dictatorship of the monopolies and their financial interests. It sends out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers, unemployed and small and medium-sized farms and to all the victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO wishes to impose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does not, however, mean that we accept the shape of current agricultural policy, which is producer-driven, large-scale and based upon heavy subsidies. Nor can we support duties affording protection against the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we should like to see a common agricultural policy. However, we think there would be risks in each nation’s devising its own agricultural subsidies. A new common agricultural policy must be small-scale and be based upon rural development and environmentally-minded agriculture. It is an area which must be characterised and permeated by long-term sustainable development, for example when it comes to the environment and the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to my first question – and is it not dangerous to negotiate the Built-In Agenda separately? – Commissioner Lamy said that the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on agricultural trade and trade in services are not really negotiations but just preparatory talks. Perhaps that distinction is valid from an abstract point of view, but in practice I do not think it holds water.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's reply to my second question – should we not redefine the negotiating mandate in the light of the trend of events and public opinion? – was negative: it stated that the Commission would stick to the mandate defined at the time of Agenda 2000. In any case, the European Parliament has just underpinned that position by explicitly rejecting two amendments calling for the Blair House Agreement to be renegotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">In his reply to my third question – before opening new negotiations, should we not first define more clearly how the negotiators are to be monitored? – Commissioner Lamy referred mainly to the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission. That is certainly a matter of some significance, but basically my question concerned scrutiny by the Council, which sets the Commission's negotiating objectives, and by the national parliaments, which in my view have the final say. Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that the Protocol, which was still part of the preliminary draft for Nice in November, was not incorporated, at least the part concerning scrutiny of the way negotiations are conducted at the WTO. It stated that the Presidency and the Member States may accompany the Commission to WTO meetings, that the Commission must forward all the documents at its disposal without delay, that it has a binding obligation to respond to the wishes of a Member State to open a consultation procedure, that the common position upheld by the Commission is established by the Council, and that the Council may at all times address negotiating directives to the Commission. I believe it is essential to observe these rules, in one form or another, in order to ensure proper scrutiny of the WTO negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than anything, it implies that the price of a product outweighs all other considerations. Whoever can deliver at the cheapest price, gains that segment of the market and drives away the more expensive producers. With ever lower transport costs, it is possible to haul any cheap raw material and any cheap end product from anywhere. The competition is forced to choose between cheaper deliveries or going under. Those in favour of this mechanism claim that it makes producers more ingenious and effective and that the consumer benefits. That is why there should be unlimited competition, ultimately at world level, if possible. Despite this, there are sound reasons for raising production costs and for protecting production from cheaper competitors. The reasons are: safety at work, proper pay for employees, ruling out child labour, effective distribution of employment across the region, care for the environment, preventing animal suffering, discouraging unnecessary traffic, and providing facilities and services which may not be money-spinners logistically speaking, but are useful and desirable nevertheless. That is a task for the democratically elected government, but WTO agreements render this task secondary to blind market forces. Although the rapporteur’s proposal is inadequate in my view, I will not vote against something which can help curb this trend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
