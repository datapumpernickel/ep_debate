<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, today we are debating the annual report on the area of freedom, security and justice created at the Tampere Summit in October 1999. I think we should in fact call it an area of justice, freedom and security, because justice is the cornerstone of our European Union, which sees itself as a Community of justice. We made two important steps forward in Nice, which we welcome: first, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was adopted and should now be made legally binding and, secondly, the reform of the European Court of Justice; these are two of the pièces de résistance of the Nice Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, Europe as a Community of justice still has a long way to go, especially as regards cross-border judicial collaboration in civil and criminal matters and – and I think this is most important – in human and civil rights, precisely because the Charter of Fundamental rights is still not binding. And, of course, being a Community of justice also means that we require not only that candidate countries comply with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, but that we implement and comply with our own resolutions and legal acts. Hence, our main question to the Council and to the Commission is, what is the current state of play as regards the implementation of the agreements and resolutions which form part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, what is the timetable here and why are there still so many delays in this area?</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is freedom. Freedom is a product of justice. Freedom is based on human dignity. But, to prevent freedom from being abused, we need security, because without security and without justice, freedom is the law of the strongest. We do not want a law of the strongest, we want a law of the weakest, which is why we need a security policy based on justice. There are considerable deficits in the cross-border fight against crime, in collaboration in judicial matters and in the unification of law. In this sense, I should like to call on the Council to expand Europol without delay, to make some headway at long last with parliamentary control of Europol, to finalise the establishment of the European police academy in coming weeks – here too there have been delays, even if the Commission had positive developments to report yesterday – and to ensure that there are common European border controls. The European Parliament suggested this on my initiative three years ago. I am grateful that a few Member States are now pressing in the Council for uniform border controls on the external borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also want to ask the Council in this extremely important debate exactly how it sees its responsibility vis-à-vis the European Parliament. We have begun excellent collaboration with the Commission and with Commissioner Vitorino but we have identified a number of clear deficits as regards cooperation in the area of justice and internal affairs. We are holding today’s debate without a written annual report or any documents on the part of the Council on what has been done and still needs to be done in this crucial political area. The Commission scoreboard here is exemplary. But there is no annual report from the Council on what happened in the year 2000 in this crucial area. I think that Parliament should be properly informed and taken into account and that Parliament needs to be more involved in the crucial area of justice and internal affairs. We can see crucial deficits on the part of the Council here. You cannot build a citizens’ Europe and yet bypass the elected representatives of the people, namely us parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the sensitive area of asylum law. What we are lacking here – as in justice and internal affairs as a whole – is a strategic approach on the part of the Council. We have a plethora of often contradictory initiatives from the individual states. We have a multitude of individual approaches, but still no strategic approach to a common asylum policy, a common immigration policy or a division of the burden, a division of the numbers between the Member States. We call on the Council to make good these deficits.</p>

It is a great honour to be able to talk to you today. The European Parliament is a very important player in European integration and the Swedish Presidency places great emphasis on having a good relationship with you. We hope we have been able to demonstrate this ambition in part, particularly in meeting committees in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very relevant area which we are discussing today. Studies clearly show that judicial cooperation is close to the heart of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, organised crime largely transcends national borders, not least because of the development of new technology. There are justified demands and higher expectations from the European citizens that we really will deliver results, in both the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">As you possibly know, on justice issues we currently have the heaviest legislation programme within the whole Union. In the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions from the Tampere Summit the EU has put forward a very ambitious plan for how we are to succeed in achieving an area of freedom, security and justice. Implementation is, as you know, now at a very intense stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As you also know, the Treaty on European Union lays down that each year the European Parliament is to hold a debate on the progress which has been made in the areas covered by Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. Although the Treaty only refers to the third pillar, I and my colleagues do not wish to restrict the debate to questions concerning the third pillar. Often there is an intimate link between issues falling under the first and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">In general it can be said that the year 2000, which is what we are reporting on today, is year one of the post-Tampere period. As I said, Tampere meant a major step forward in justice and home affairs, and a very ambitious programme was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by briefly mentioning some of the progress made in the field of justice during 2000. In that year the Justice and Home Affairs Council passed around twenty legal instruments, eight of which were regulations and three conventions. Action plans have been adopted for almost all areas of activity on justice and home affairs. Over and above this the Council adopted over thirty conclusions, resolutions, recommendations and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress was made on a number of issues by the very successful French and Portuguese presidencies. Decisions were reached in several important areas in terms of combating economic crime. A decision was passed on protection of the Euro, and at the joint meeting of JHA/Ecofin in Luxembourg on 17 October, a number of important decisions were adopted, e.g. concerning money laundering. We took the first step in the process towards setting up Eurojust, which we consider an incredibly important aspect in the fight against organised crime. We made major efforts in the fight against IT crime, e.g. by adopting a decision on combating child pornography on the Internet. Furthermore, we succeeded in developing the principle of mutual recognition by adopting a programme of measures regarding mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Several decisions were also passed to improve cooperation in the field of civil law, for example, on the service of documents, insolvency and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this I would like to focus on the question posed by Mr Posselt. I will attempt to respond to the parts concerning justice and home affairs, while my colleague Mrs Klingvall will reply to the questions concerning asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, part of the question asked concerns the dialogue between the institutions and the measures which have been planned to make this dialogue more efficient and more clearly define the relationship between the institutions, the Member States and, for example, Europol and Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Conclusions have meant major changes in the field of justice and home affairs. As I said earlier, ambitious plans have been laid down and the rate of work is increasing. Not only the scope but also the character of cooperation has changed. The institutions have partly taken on new roles and the way they work is being redesigned. We are in the middle of the implementation of Tampere, and we can identify certain areas in which all the institutions are adapting to new conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my firm conviction that setting up an area of freedom, security and justice requires close cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and it is in this spirit that the Swedish Presidency wishes to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty provides a clear framework for formal relations between the Council and the European Parliament when legal instruments and other instruments are being drawn up in the field of justice and home affairs. The Council is fully aware that the ambitious work in this area also means a considerable workload for you in Parliament. The Council’s deadlines for statements from the European Parliament must be determined by balancing considerations on the one hand of the importance of the issue being dealt with promptly and, on the other, of the workload of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have to jointly take responsibility for the future of the EU. It is important that we focus on what is important and really focus our time and energy on the central issues of EU development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency has begun discussions on the way the Council works. At an informal Council meeting on 8 and 9 February, where we also had the pleasure of meeting Mr Watson, we all agreed that making the work of the Council more efficient is necessary if we are to achieve the targets which were laid down in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">One question which will be addressed in the overview which has begun is the constantly increasing multitude of initiatives in the area of justice and home affairs. It is my conviction that we must achieve better predictability and coordination when it comes to new legislation initiatives. Such an improvement would make the joint work of the institutions much easier.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the relationship between the institutions and Europol and Eurojust respectively. It is the conviction of the presidency that Parliament’s access to and opportunities to monitor, for instance, the work of Europol, can and should be improved. The presidency considers that this ought to be able to be arranged in practice. There may be measures which can be taken in the short term and which may not require any regulatory changes.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Eurojust, the Council has not yet begun to discuss how Parliament and Commission are to be involved in the work and given the opportunity to monitor operations. It is nonetheless clear that questions concerning relations between Eurojust, the Commission and Parliament will be addressed in the negotiations. The proposed Council decisions on which Parliament is to issue its opinion are based on the regulations in the Europol Convention, both in terms of the Commission’s participation in the work and the opportunity of Parliament to monitor it. Where this issue, too, is concerned, I would like, however, to emphasise that we must consider the opportunity of further improving conditions for Parliament to gain access.</p>
<p class="contents">Before addressing the next question, I would like to emphasise our aim of maintaining good relations with you. To emphasise this we submitted a written report to you yesterday that clearly lays out the work of the Council in the field of justice and home affairs during the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Posselt also mentions the principle of mutual recognition and the measures which are planned to improve the mutual recognition of judgments in the field of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">The mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases and traditional judicial cooperation have the same purpose: for cooperation between Member States to improve such that we can achieve an area of freedom, security and justice. In December last year, in the light of the conclusions from Tampere, the Council adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition. This programme of measures is ambitious and wide-ranging. It contains a large number of measures which are to be implemented. The principle of mutual recognition as expressed in the programme of measures covers decisions before the judgment, the judgment itself and decisions after the judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this, Sweden, together with Belgium and France, has taken the initiative for an instrument on decisions before judgments. This concerns mutual recognition of decisions, and the freezing of assets and evidence. The instrument aims to quickly prevent assets and evidence being hidden from the authorities investigating the crime. When the instrument was presented, it was received positively, and negotiations will begin this spring during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">During the spring it is likely that initiatives concerning mutual recognition and enforcement of fines will be submitted. This will see the beginning of work in recognising and implementing the judgments themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention cooperation in the field of civil law, particularly the work which has commenced to create a European Enforcement Order for uncontested debts. A European Enforcement Order, unlike a national one, could be enforced in all Member States without any inter-state control. This is the first important step towards our goals, namely for judgments in one Member State to be able to be recognised and enforced directly throughout the entire Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude I would like to answer Mr Posselt’s questions on the implementation of legislation in our field and the issue of what we just mentioned, an annual report on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the work in creating an area of freedom, security and justice, we are largely dependent on legal instruments which must be implemented in the national law of Member States. A number of instruments which we agreed on at the end of the 1990s have already been able to enter into force. Furthermore, we currently have an opportunity to implement several instruments despite the fact that they have not entered into force in all Member States. After the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, several community legal instruments, such as regulations, have been adopted in the field of justice and home affairs. Several of these instruments have already entered into force or are on the way to doing so. One concrete example is what is known as the Brussels II Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We initially also mentioned that we are in the process of producing an overview of our working methods at JHA. The question of the Member States’ implementation of the measures taken in the field of JHA is one of the questions addressed in this context. I do not rule out further measures being needed if Member States are better to live up to what they have undertaken in the Council. Some form of control of implementation may be one way of putting pressure on all of us to really fulfil our undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency today has no final solutions as to what such a mechanism would look like. The proposal referred to in the question, an annual report, may be one way but the Council will have to return to that question with more concrete information at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am here to report on developments on issues concerning asylum and immigration. As you are well aware, we are now in a very intensive phase in which we are moving towards increased harmonisation of Member States’ asylum and immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that these questions belong at European level. Work to develop a common asylum and immigration policy is important for several reasons. It will contribute to creating an area of freedom, security and justice in the EU. Furthermore, asylum seekers and others wishing to live in our countries will know that they will receive an equal reception and an equal assessment of their reasons whatever Member State they apply to. This would also enable us to distribute responsibility more evenly between Member States. We will jointly be able to confirm international undertakings and values such as solidarity, human rights and legal protection. In this work the UNHCR plays a very important advisory role.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt as to where we are heading. The goals and action plans have been laid down in Amsterdam, Vienna and Tampere, as has the Commission’s scoreboard. The Commission has worked intensively and many proposals have been presented in the past year. It is now up to us in the Council to take this work further, and your opinions are important in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">During the year the Council has passed decisions on a number of issues concerning asylum and immigration. The European Refugee Fund was adopted at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 28 September 2000. The Member States have applied for funding from this fund for 2000 and 2001 for various projects focusing on reception, integration and repatriation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also passed two decisions linked to the Dublin Convention. On 11 December 2000 the Eurodac Regulation was adopted. We hope this will contribute to a more efficient application of the Dublin Convention. At the last meeting of the Council on 15 – 16 March, the Council was also able to pass the decision that Norway and Iceland be linked to the Dublin Convention and Eurodac. We now look forward to the Commission’s proposal for a community law instrument which will replace the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the former Council meeting the Council was able to adopt the Visa Regulation which means that we will now have completely harmonised rules regarding which countries’ citizens are to be exempt from the requirement for a visa and to which countries this requirement is to apply in the future. Under the regulation Bulgaria, Hong Kong and Macao and at a later stage also Romania will be transferred to the list of countries which do not require a visa.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that – before the Swedish Presidency is over – we will be able to add to this list of decisions on Community rules directives on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on the right to family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to temporary protection, experience from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo show that we have to take joint, united responsibility next time the Union receives a massive influx of displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of family reunification is also important. We must be able to give everyone resident in our countries the chance to live with their immediate family. We also hope to be able to reach agreement at the Council meeting in May on mutual recognition of expulsion orders.</p>
<p class="contents">During the year the Council has also held other important and valuable discussions. On the question of minimum conditions for reception of asylum seekers, the Council held theoretical discussions on a number of important issues, including access to the labour market, the right to free movement in the territory and area of application. We are now looking forward to the Commission’s proposal which is expected to be presented shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also addressed two proposals, one directive and the framework decision on common rules for combating trafficking in human beings and assisting people to reside illegally in our countries. The discussions concerned a number of theoretical issues, namely a humanitarian clause, the minimum punishment and the scope of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council meeting of 30 November – 1 December 2000 a French initiative was discussed to harmonise economic sanctions as part of the carrier’s liability. At that time we were not able to achieve political agreement on the proposal. The Swedish Presidency is currently investigating conditions for achieving political agreement. I am well aware of Parliament’s position on these issues and we will naturally be taking this into account in our continued work.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important questions are more definite and more comparable statistics and the Commission proposal on the rights of third country nationals who are long-term residents of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">More wide-ranging discussions have also been held at several informal meetings of the Council of Ministers. In Lisbon we discussed, among other things, how we are to follow up the Tampere Summit on the basis of the Commission’s scoreboard. In Marseilles the question of migration to Europe in the long term was in focus. And in Stockholm we discussed how we can make work on implementing the Tampere Conclusions more efficient and how we – on the basis of the Commission’s report on asylum – are to consolidate our work to develop a common asylum system in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions concerning asylum and immigration are close to our citizens and often arouse strong feelings. During the past year, on several occasions, we have seen pictures of tragedies in conjunction with people attempting to enter our countries. This makes great demand of us to design a common policy which will enable us to deal with the pressure of migration into the EU Member States as quickly as possible. We must take responsibility for refugees and others who need protection in our countries. We must also have rules which make it easier to exchange visits and which allow a certain amount of other immigration. It is important that we have a modern immigration policy where we work to eradicate the fundamental causes of involuntary migration, prevent illegal immigration, guarantee protection to those who require it and are able to provide fair treatment of those immigrants who have permanent residence in our countries. This is precisely what the Tampere Conclusions are about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that we view the work of harmonising the asylum and immigration policy of the Member States on the basis of a holistic approach. During the Swedish Presidency proposals from the Commission concerning asylum will be on the Council table and the same is also true of the majority of the proposals in the field of immigration and visas. We will therefore have a chance to see the whole picture more clearly, which is necessary to obtain a well-balanced common policy. This does not mean that we will not attempt to agree on the proposals on the Council’s table as quickly as possible. However, this will take place within the framework of the visions and the strategy adopted in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions for immigration to our countries change over time. I therefore look forward to the upcoming Belgian Presidency’s focus on the question of the immigration of labour to the Union. This is a question which I believe will come to be all the more important in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the written questions I have to answer, I will begin with that concerning the results which can be reported up to today’s date from the membership negotiations with candidate countries in terms of the area of freedom, security and justice and the forms in which the Council wishes to continue the negotiations, particularly on Chapter 24. Negotiations on this chapter opened for the Luxembourg group at the end of the Portuguese Presidency while they have not yet begun for the Helsinki group. A draft for a common negotiating position for five of the Helsinki countries is expected by the beginning of May. A revised draft is expected by mid-June for the Luxembourg countries – all according to the schedule of the Commission. Negotiations on this chapter will not close for any country during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">During February and March the Commission carried out technical consultations with all candidate countries affected, with the aim of examining the regulations and ironing out any question marks. According to the Commission’s schedule, an updated negotiating position for the Luxembourg countries will be available in June. For the Helsinki countries the first draft will be complete during May.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can be unaware that enlargement is one of the Swedish government’s three most important priorities. It is a historic challenge and an historic opportunity. Primarily it is about building a basis for peace, freedom and democracy throughout Europe. We have promised to do what we can such that in the coming months we will be able to contribute to paving the way for a political breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This also concerns to a large extent the field of justice and home affairs, which, after all, is one of the cornerstones of the entire negotiation process. A state based on the principles of a state governed by law is a precondition for membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Today nobody can say how the negotiations on justice and home affairs will proceed in practice. This is, in fact, the first time ever that actual negotiations have been carried out in this area ahead of enlargement of the Union. However, one thing is already clear: besides the requirements made by the formal regulatory framework, there are high expectations of a more practical nature. We place great emphasis on the candidate countries taking concrete steps to achieve both the administrative capacity and the implementation of the legislation adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate countries are responsible for maintaining the rate of the adaptation work such that it is possible to achieve acceptable negotiation solutions. We Member States have a responsibility to assist the candidate countries in this respect. The Swedish Presidency considers it important to involve the candidate countries in EU cooperation at an early stage. What is known as the pre-accession pact against organised crime and the horizontal Phare programmes on asylum, immigration, visas and border controls are good examples of candidate countries and Member States already working together at this stage. A trusting relationship between us and an understanding of the conditions and situation under which the other is operating are fundamental preconditions for successful cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we have also invited representatives of the candidate countries to a number of different meetings and seminars during our presidency. Most recently the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the Member States and candidate countries met at an informal meeting on 16 March. Here discussion centred around how we can strengthen mutual practical cooperation before the countries join. On point after point we were able to see that cooperation has already begun and that the foundations have now been laid as to how we can strengthen this cooperation further.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question I have to answer concerns which measures the Council is planning to create a common immigration policy and the deadlines laid down for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s immigration policy partly covers immigration based on human needs for protection and partly covers immigration which takes place, for example, to reunite divided families or because people wish to obtain better economic conditions or a good education. Immigration policy in the narrow sense, however, excludes the immigration which can be seen as concerning people’s need for protection; this is addressed within the framework of asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already a number of non-binding legal instruments which were adopted within this field of policy before this policy area was transferred to community law. The first step towards harmonising national law was taken under Title VI. Work has since continued and the old legal instruments will gradually be replaced by instruments in community law. At the moment, for example, the right to family reunification is being addressed. The presidency plans to achieve political agreement on this proposal in the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, during March 2001 the Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive on the status of third country nationals who have been resident in a Member State for a long period. An important aspect of this proposal is the right to settle and work in another Member State. Preliminary discussion of the proposal will begin during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">A directive on conditions for entry and residence for the purpose of paid employment and self employed economic activity will be presented in the first six months of 2001. This is a directive which will be particularly interesting in the light of the debate begun in the Union in view of Member States’ increased need for labour. This will continue during autumn 2001 when the Belgian Presidency will organise a seminar on the subject. Furthermore, during spring 2001, the Commission will submit a proposal on conditions for entry and residence for the purpose of study or vocational training and a proposal concerning unpaid work.</p>
<p class="contents">The on-going work clearly shows that we within the EU are operating an active immigration policy. The basic principle of this policy must be that the people who are granted the right of entry and residence and who have resided legally in a Member State should largely have the same rights and obligations as EU citizens. This is also clear from the Conclusions of the Tampere Summit. These also state that an important part of the Union’s policy in this field is effective handling of immigration in all its aspects and cooperation with countries of origin is to constitute an important part of this work.</p>
<p class="contents">The final question concerns whether the Council considers it likely that number-based cost allocation between Member States for the reception of asylum seekers will be introduced within the framework of a common asylum policy. The question of the extent to which the allocation of responsibility is to be part of the common European asylum policy can be answered from two different standpoints, firstly, from a perspective focusing on specific proposals for directives and secondly, on a more general perspective concerning the allocation of responsibility as a result of asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam lays down the basis for creating a common asylum system and the question of allocation of responsibility between EU Member States is set out in Article 63.2 (b). This Article states that the Council must “promote a balance of effort between Member States in receiving and bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons.” This intention was also confirmed by the Heads of State or Government in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also state that on 28 September last year the Council adopted the European Refugee Fund whose aim is to promote the allocation of responsibility within the EU, both structurally and in emergency situations. We also have the proposed directive on temporary protection in the event of mass influx of displaced persons, which includes a chapter concerning solidarity, in other words measures which will facilitate the allocation of responsibility between Member States, which is something that the Member States also emphasise highly.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal for the legislative work which is currently underway with great intensity is to create a common European asylum system which can lead to greater predictability and justice for the individual and the asylum seeker, who will come to receive equal treatment in all Member States. I believe that such a common system will lead in a natural way to a more balanced allocation of responsibility between EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at your request, I will take a current example of needless human trafficking, which once again shows that we have to act quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns the sinking of the vessel “East Sea” outside the French town of San Raphael in February with around 1 000 asylum seekers. The event is now being investigated by the French authorities, and any consequences for those responsible will be issued under French law.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has submitted a wish that the Council issue a statement on this event. However, the Council as an institution can hardly issue such a statement in a case which primarily concerns a national government. At the same time it is important that we within the Union demonstrate unanimity in our efforts to combat this type of organised crime. It is therefore important that this is reflected in our assessment of the criminality of these actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is working hard to draw up common provisions on the framework for criminal law against those who assist illegal entry and residence. The Council is seeking an acceptable text which makes a clear difference between trafficking in human beings which exploits vulnerable people on the one hand and the work of known voluntary organisations and others acting out of humanitarian or non-profit making motives on the other. I wish to emphasise that there is great support among Member States for our not criminalising actions carried out for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I also wish to state that the Council has already developed an early warning system which makes it possible for Member States to inform each other of potential flows of refugees. The candidate countries are also providing information for this system.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures which the Council is working on to combat illegal immigration are the directive on carrier liability, which is not to be seen as an isolated instrument but as part of a larger and more wide-ranging policy. The Council is also investigating the opportunity of establishing a network of liaison officers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the most effective way of preventing illegal immigration is to work together with the countries which currently act as transit countries. By strengthening their asylum system we will all contribute to reinforcing the opportunities for protecting refugees and to ensuring that these countries become less interesting to human traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, dealing with the underlying causes of involuntary migration is the only way to avoid the tragedies involved in human trafficking. Thus it is very important that we employ the holistic approach on which the entire harmonisation process is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Council, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Posselt for having tabled the oral question that has formed the basis for this debate. In answering the questions he has raised, I shall not focus on what was done in 2000, because an exhaustive and rigorous assessment of this subject has already been made by the representatives of the Council. First and foremost, I wish to outline the most important landmarks in the process of preparing for the Laeken European Council, which is the occasion that has been chosen for the first in-depth assessment of the results we have achieved in implementing the Tampere mandate. 1999 was a turning point in the field of justice and home affairs. 2000 marked the beginning of the implementation of the Tampere mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s opinion, it is no exaggeration to say that we have made a good start. We feel that we have made a proposal for a scoreboard with whose structure and content you are all familiar and I shall therefore not go into this in detail. Through this scoreboard, however, we will be able to identify, transparently, clearly and with a sense of responsibility, the progress as well as the delays in the way we are implementing the Tampere mandate. I shall, therefore, not be referring to the scoreboard’s content, but I do wish to begin by referring to an issue raised by Mr Posselt; that of drafting an annual budget on progress made in consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that a dynamic scoreboard such as we would wish this to be responds to Mr Posselt’s concern. I think, however, that we can improve the scoreboard in two ways: firstly, by strengthening the political dimension of the part of the process we have already completed when we introduce each revised version of the scorecard at the end of each presidency. Secondly, improvements can be made by adapting the very structure of the scoreboard in future editions, particularly in the light of the outcome of the Laeken European Council, so that the scoreboard also reflects the way in which each Member State is implementing decisions taken at European level within its own national law.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that, although we have made a good start, we are entitled to have conflicting feelings about the Union’s decision-making power in this field. Here we are faced with two problems that I see no reason to hide. The first concerns the myriad initiatives of the Member States, the reasoning behind which sometimes escapes us. It is not my intention to question the Member States’ right of initiative. Consolidating an area of freedom, security and justice can only be achieved through close cooperation between all the Union’s institutions and also – and perhaps most importantly – between the Member States. The Commission does share Parliament’s concerns, however, about the sometimes fragmented approach to many of the Member States’ initiatives, and the danger that they will fail to provide added value to our common project. I am not questioning the good intentions behind these initiatives, but they are sometimes rather unfocused; if they are in line with the priorities of the European common agenda, these initiatives will be welcome. If, however, these initiatives simply serve each Member State’s internal political agenda of the day, then I am afraid that they will not help us to fulfil the very demanding programme laid down in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the Commission’s willingness to explore all avenues for improving cooperation with Member States in exercising legislative initiative. Secondly, and it is worth saying this now, in advance of Laeken, we risk facing delays in meeting the Tampere timetable. Unless the Council’s pace and decision making pick up, in other words, if we maintain our current speed, when we reach Laeken, we will be lagging a long way behind the objectives outlined in Tampere. I am therefore greatly encouraged by the discussion held at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency, which I welcomed, at the informal Stockholm Council on the need to speed up the pace of decision making and the need to improve the Commission’s working methods. The Commission is willing to play its part, under the leadership of the Swedish Presidency, in this task of discussing and streamlining the Council’s methods for taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific questions raised by Mr Posselt, I shall be very brief. In the field of transposing the Community acquis into national law, it must be said that, where the conventions of the third pillar are concerned, only one has been signed and ratified by all Member States and that is the Europol Convention. None of the other conventions has, to date, been signed and ratified by all 15 Member States. With regard to the framework decisions, it is too early to talk about their transposal because they are still very recent and there are not yet enough of them to be able to produce an assessment report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question, concerning a common immigration policy, the Commission has already contributed, in the communication it submitted to the Council and to Parliament in November of last year, to what can be considered to be the basis of such a policy, which is the creation of a European concept of immigration and of a vision for framing an immigration policy. In this communication, we focused on two objectives. The first of these was a raft of legislative initiatives establishing a common Community acquis and the second was the launch of a process of open coordination within the Council to coordinate the management of migration flow policies. We presented a proposal on family reunification, which I hope will be adopted during the Swedish Presidency. We also presented a proposal on the rights and responsibilities of third-country nationals who are long-term residents. In July, we shall be presenting a proposal on conditions for the admission of immigrants for purposes of work and, at the end of the year, we shall be presenting an additional proposal on the admission of citizens of third countries for the purpose of study, training or for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">By July of this year, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal to make the method for open coordination in the field of immigration policy operational, with a view to this being up and running in 2002, in parallel with the Swedish Presidency’s initiative to improve our statistical mechanisms in the field of immigration. At the same time, the new Odysseus programme will enable us to launch a programme of administrative cooperation between the Member States and we hope to launch the bases of what will be the creation of a common border police force, as mentioned by Mr Posselt. In the field of immigration, I do not think that we should ignore the prospect of a proactive policy of integrating immigrant communities into the reception societies. We must therefore explore all the options contained in the anti-discrimination package that the Commission presented last year and, at the same time, build on the immigration component in the Lisbon strategy, confirmed in Stockholm, of combating social exclusion. In this policy of integrating immigrants, we must be able to count on the commitment and support of the Member States’ regions and local authorities. With regard to illegal immigration, the Commission has already presented two proposals for a framework decision on the trafficking of human beings and intends to present two communications. One of these will concern the fight against illegal immigration and the other will be on repatriation policies. I shall conclude this point by emphasising my hope that following the Conference being organised by the Belgian Presidency, we may see political agreement on the overall concept of European immigration policy at the Laeken Council, so that, from then on, no more excuses are given for the lack of a joint vision preventing us from adopting practical legislative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of asylum, I wish to point out that the Commission has embraced the principle of solidarity, both in its proposal on the ‘European Refugee Fund’ and in its proposal on ‘Temporary Protection’ based on the principle of ‘double voluntary action’. I hope that, under the leadership of the Swedish Presidency, we will be able to conclude a political agreement on temporary protection. I acknowledge, however, along with Mr Posselt, that the discussions in Council have not led to much opportunity for improving the financial dimension of solidarity and prove that the process of defining any form of imposing the distribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States will not be easy. The best solution to the problem of sharing responsibility is likely to be a common European asylum system based on the ideas outlined in the Commission’s communication of last November.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of the mutual recognition of judgments, I simply wish to inform Parliament that we are working on a major package in the field of extradition and the European search and arrest warrant, as well as a package dealing with the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, specifically protective orders in investigations carried out within the fight against cybercrime. In civil matters, by the end of the year, we will be supplementing the ‘Brussels­I’ initiative with a proposal for a European enforcement order in civil matters, and with additional initiatives from ‘Brussels-II’ on the mutual recognition of judgments in the field of family law, in domestic issues and matters concerning parental power and the issuing of proposals on the recognition of low-value claims and undisputed claims.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the interinstitutional dialogue, Mr President, the Commission wishes to confirm here that the dialogue between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament is essential to a successful outcome. In this field, the Commission and Parliament must be given a greater role to play in the democratic control of Europol. This is another initiative that the Commission will be adopting in the course of this year. We have an ambitious programme and I am confident that the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies will ensure that the right pace is set for us to achieve a favourable outcome at Laeken. I should like to conclude by simply expressing the Commission’s appreciation to Parliament, and particularly to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in the person of its chairman, Mr Watson, for the way in which you have responded, sometimes with very little time, to requests concerning the Commission’s proposals and those of the Member States. If there have been delays, they are certainly not due to a lack of proposals or opinions issued by Parliament. Secondly, I should like to reiterate the Commission’s desire to deepen political dialogue with the European Parliament so that together we can find the best solutions, which will, in this House, enjoy the broad political support of the various European political families. I respect the diversity of Parliament’s political and ideological opinions, but we do have a common objective, which is to convey to the people of Europe a clear political message that meets their expectations. This is a simple message: the European institutions make a decisive contribution to confirming freedom, security and justice as inseparable values, true cornerstones laid out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and which express what we have in common and what we can be proud of. Let us take pride in our European identity.</p>

I am delighted at the commitment of the Swedish Presidency, even if a great many problems still remain to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">But, that notwithstanding, allow me to draw your attention to three problem areas, parts of which have already been addressed, namely the deficits which we have, secondly, the solutions which we still need, because the proposals seem to bear no relation to reality and, thirdly, the uncoordinated initiatives by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with the last point. You have my support here, Commissioner. You feel that we need a new modus operandi here. We spend a great deal of time on parallel initiatives which very often have no legal basis and which we often suspect are nationally motivated rather than concerned with finding European solutions. We need an efficient mechanism for pushing ahead with the positive aspects here.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that there has been a dramatic increase in both drug abuse in the European Union and in drug production, especially the production of synthetic drugs, in the European Union. In the meantime, there are now over 5 million young people taking synthetic drugs. The European Union has become the biggest producer and exporter of synthetic drugs in the world. And if we look at the scoreboard, then we can see that very little action has been taken. An initiative plan was submitted in 2000, but no further action was taken. I would ask for this to be made a new focal point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention one more thing. Where there is no bearing on reality, as in the case of family reunion ...</p>

<p class="contents">A comparison between the initial forecasts and the latest revision of the scoreboard shows, for instance, how we have progressed – I would say remarkably – in matters of judicial cooperation. We have hopes for the future of Eurojust and this Parliament welcomes the decisions taken by the Council and the Member States’ initiatives which, in the field of judicial cooperation, have added to the Commission proposals, thus creating a circle that should be maintained in future.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group also values the highly significant Commission communication on the mutual recognition of sentences in criminal matters. We hope it will be a solid base from which to combat crime, especially those more callous and intolerable versions such as terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ministers, we are well aware of what the European Commission has presented this last year in connection with the Tampere Agenda: it is on the scoreboard. What we do not know is what the Council is thinking of doing with them in the immediate future. In exchange, we have seen concrete and fragmentary proposals – I do not want to return to the debate we had in the previous sitting – from each Member State, which in this case we cannot accept at all, either now or in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have also talked about the shock caused by the arrival of the “East Sea” in Europe. It shocked everyone, and I think it would have done so even more if the citizens knew that even before Tampere we had set up something which (talking of cooperation with the countries of origin) is called an action plan for northern Iraq, i.e. the Kurds. But the citizens do not know. Just as those of my country do not know that we have set up an action plan for Morocco, and while they keep finding the bodies of our young neighbours on their beaches they wonder what the European Union is doing. In fact, the impression given by the press is that not even our government knows.</p>
<p class="contents">Laeken is going to be a new opportunity for the common immigration and asylum policy. Please do not just reaffirm the Tampere decisions again. Tell us how you intend to move forward. Please do not repeat that things are on the right road. Really convince yourselves that your decisions are good ones, and uphold them clearly and with determination and courage. Parliament – and I am sure in this respect the citizens too – will follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, they are spread over half a dozen sections of the Treaties, from the third-pillar articles on intergovernmental police and judicial cooperation, to the provisions on asylum and immigration, to other scattered articles on fundamental rights, non-discrimination, EU citizenship and free movement. In this crucial area of creating a citizens' Europe, we start with a pretty incoherent framework. Our procedures are also inadequate; add to that the way in which Member States have showered upon us a host of uncoordinated initiatives, and it is not surprising that two years after the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, we have a lot of frenetic activity but not enough real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We have big issues to deal with, from a policy on immigration, to combating racism and xenophobia, to ending the huge injustice of 20 million European residents having no right of movement, because they are third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">On asylum policy, it is crucial that we absolutely respect humanitarian obligations and practise coherent thinking. How can we speak derogatorily of the 1 000 Iraqi Kurds in the “East Sea” as illegal economic migrants, when NATO members, including my own Member State, are sufficiently conscious of their vulnerability to Saddam Hussein's persecution, as demonstrated in the past, to enforce a no-fly zone in northern Iraq? We really do not have much joined-up thinking on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We must change the way we work, so as to make the area of freedom, security and justice as visible to the citizen as it is politically significant. Perhaps then we could have a debate which might attract a fuller chamber and convey something of the passion and vision that we heard from the President of the Federal Republic of Germany this morning.</p>

These are not national problems. Regularly, in Gibraltar, at Calais and elsewhere, refugees are coming ashore at European ports. They risk their lives to flee from dictatorships, conflict and misery. However, they are likely to end up as illegal immigrants, and they know it. One only has to look at France, where 94% of applications for asylum are rejected. Yet the right of asylum is a fundamental and inalienable right. There is a European fund to provide support for the consequences of receiving these people here. In order to improve efficiency, is the Council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund?</p>
<p class="contents">Acting at European level means more than merely denouncing and condemning those who trade in human misery: as you have pointed out, Mrs Ludford, only an overall solution will deal with these problems, with the emphasis on a foreign policy of cooperation just as much as on a genuine policy of integration which recognises the equality of the rights of all citizens. Does the Council therefore not think that as a matter of urgency the Union should provide itself with an effective statutory instrument in the form of a framework directive which would enable it to regularise the position of all illegal immigrants, in order to adopt a more realistic and humane attitude towards immigration. At the present time, two mechanisms are being studied...</p>

Words should now be followed by actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In March, when Parliament rejected, fortunately, several Council initiatives, I wondered when we would have any Council initiatives and proposed directives drawn up in a spirit of openness towards the world, of welcome and humanity, rather than reflecting an approach concerned solely with policing and security. Yes, Europe does have a duty to take initiatives, but not the sort of initiatives that would cause a breach of solidarity, or impose arbitrary sanctions on transport companies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, a common policy on immigration requires ambitious initiatives based on improving and strengthening the right of asylum, guaranteeing both that right and the right to freedom of movement, and facilities for receiving migrants with dignity and with respect for human rights. We also need to take restrictive and punitive measures, not against the victims, but against those who are behind this human traffic. So when shall we see an end to the expulsions, when will the situation of illegal immigrants living on European soil be regularised, and when will non-Community foreigners have the right to vote in local elections? It is impossible to avoid answering these questions if we want to move towards a policy that is more just, more humane and more effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, a comment on the semantics. Both the Treaty and the question talk about introducing an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’. The impression might be created that freedom, security and justice did not exist in the Member States, as if our countries were a legal vacuum. However, that is not the case. The situation, of course, is that we have a wide range of very traditional and deeply rooted legal systems which are distinguished primarily by their extraordinary difference from one another. It is not going too far to say that the dominant system is one based upon Roman law but, in addition, there exist of course the common law system, which is significantly different, a Germanic and even a Scandinavian legal tradition, and these legal traditions differ from one another on crucial points. To introduce an area of freedom, security and justice is an absurdity from a semantic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also, of course, another objective, and that brings me on to my second remark, which is of a legal nature. What we are concerned with here is the desire to establish a single area and to homogenise these legal areas in the EU style, nipping and tucking in the interests of a better fit and in such a way as to obtain one common criminal law and one common judicial area. Finally, I have a political remark to make. This empire building through the establishment of a legal system represents one of the most repressive systems of oppression in world history. What has been established in the light of these words, ‘freedom, security and justice’, is a system of monitoring and control without parallel in world history. A system is being developed which suspends the crucial aspects of legal security. Objection can also be made to this perversion of the language which should ideally, of course, reflect reality as carefully as possible. That is something it is nowhere near doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How many people have lost their lives in attempting to tread on European soil along the Andalusian coastline, in Dover, or on the coasts of southern France or Italy? How many women and children have been and still are exploited by organised criminal networks that – and this is the worst part – act with impunity in European territory? We must begin to find answers to these questions now, and fast! The fight against organised crime, terrorism, drugs or the trafficking of human beings requires new police methods, a readjustment of legislation, and the immediate adaptation of police and judicial cooperation to the new European area. No terrorist, drug trafficker or trafficker in human beings must find shelter in a Member State. And it is urgent, as the Commissioner has said, to set the European search and capture order in motion against these enemies of freedom and security. I particularly wish to thank you, Commissioner, for the interest you have shown in setting this European search and capture order in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain a recent survey has shown that terrorism and immigration have become two of the main concerns of Spanish citizens. These concerns also require European responses. We are going to have two great debates in the coming months: a report on terrorism and another on immigration and asylum. I hope that we Members of Parliament, the Commission and the Council will rise to the occasion and succeed in offering European citizens and those who legally wish to live in our territory precisely what we set forth in the recent Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Which is why we need to strengthen our citizens’ sense of security, fight organised crime, strengthen police and judicial cooperation, mutually recognise court judgments, develop an integrated, viable immigration policy based on our common European values and fight racism and xenophobia in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take stock of how far we have come since October 1999, we will see that there have been serious delays and setbacks in achieving our aims. This is because, on the one hand, we have an energetic Commission and a creative Commissioner and, on the other hand, a Council which is irresolute and appears unwilling even to implement what the governments themselves decide. Instead, we are faced with fragmentary and uncoordinated initiatives on individual issues on the part of the Member States, initiatives which often fall outside the framework agreed at Tampere. And as we know, this sort of situation causes serious problems, both to the working of the Commission, which does not have the human resources needed to respond to all these initiatives, and to the working and the agenda of the European Parliament. Of course, the Council must be credited in 2000 with the decision to set up the refugee fund and mutually recognise civil court judgments, such as in divorce cases. And, of course, the list of achievements in 2000 also includes the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Nice, although not, of course, in the manner which Parliament had hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on working to strengthen the political dimension of the venture to create a common area of freedom, security and justice in the Union, especially in its endeavour to get a framework Council decision adopted during the six-month Swedish Presidency on a Commission proposal to fight the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. As far as immigration policy is concerned and the huge gap in this area, some Member States, including Greece, have decided to plug this gap with national legislation under the Tampere agenda. Last week, the Greek government passed an immigration bill legalising and regulating the status of thousands of immigrants who entered Greece over the last ten years, thereby finding a positive solution to serious issues which the Council has stubbornly kept on the back burner.</p>

<p class="contents">Progress has been made in finding ways to work together in a policy field in which the Treaties are anything but satisfactory. But to say this throws some light on the difficulties we have encountered in the 18 months since the Tampere Summit: difficulties such as the need for separate legal arrangements in the first pillar and the third pillar; the need to cater for Member States which are members of Schengen and those which are not; the depressing predisposition of some Member States to pile headlong into individual initiatives before institutions have fully debated an overall approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake. Let us lay the most solid foundations – those of the Community framework in which architects, builders and surveyors work together in concert. Parliament has called for an annual report on the implementation of the area of freedom, security and justice. In welcoming the report that I have just received from the presidency, I note that it is essentially a list of actions. What we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken. Minister Klingvall said it is hard to comment on the case of the “East Sea” because it is a matter for individual Member States. Arguably that may be true for 24 hours; thereafter it is a matter for all of us. Surely, Minister, that is the whole point of the area of freedom, security and justice. Member States must understand that this is an area in which citizens want more Europe. We must rise to that challenge, not become bidders in a depressing downward auction of rights for our citizens or those arriving from elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is arguably the most important development that we have seen. We must incorporate it into the law of the Union for there is no area of freedom, security and justice without rights and there are no rights without judges.</p>

The question is: if we really want more freedom, security and justice, what must we do in order to prevent this policy from claiming even more lives? First, freedom is achieved by giving people a free choice of where they wish to live. Secondly, security is given to people by pressing a passport into their hand and giving them the legal wherewithal to set up home wherever they want. This results in more justice and greater fairness because it is the global economic conditions which the industrialised countries have forced on the world which turn many people into refugees in the first place. Which is why I call on the Council to take prevention seriously. A uniform modus operandi – yes, start a legalisation initiative now, because that is the only consistent policy against racism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the present time, the Kurdish people, scattered over several countries, are experiencing pitiless oppression which highlights the on-going struggle to force the government to respect the right to self-determination and to respect national minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, these tragedies that we have seen occurring on Spanish beaches or at Dover cannot result merely in our condemning the people who ship in the illegal immigrants. The Schengen area is a fortress which forces the victims of hunger or of political dictatorships to take illegal action. Yet everyone knows that no amount of policing can halt the flow of people who are in fear of their lives. Those who organise these shipments of illegal immigrants are now growing fat on these repressive laws, which in any case are a violation of the Geneva Convention. It is time to open up the borders to the free circulation of people, just as you have done for capital.

<p class="contents">Mrs Klingvall has just stated that she intends to help to achieve agreement in three areas, in precisely the three areas where the European Parliament has said no, for we have voted against the reports by Mr Ceyhun, Mr Nassauer and Mr Kirkhope. It is quite worrying that the presidency does not respect the opinion of Parliament. I myself think that it is fairly clear after the debate today that responsibility for overall policy in this field should rest with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Alarming figures are presented regarding population trends – Europe is shrinking. Member States are estimated to lose 10 percent and candidate countries 20 percent. We will see a shortage of both highly qualified and less qualified labour, and both in the short and the long term. Our external borders are under great pressure. The fact that Europe must be opened up to immigration of labour is a conclusion which even the toughest opposition have adopted. However, we know nothing about how this will work – nothing about how the system will be designed, nothing about quota systems or <span class="italic">green cards</span>, whether these openings and solutions are only to apply to those who are highly educated or whether they will also cover those with few qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Has </span>the Council no practical solutions in this area? Will crime and harsh reality decide? We look forward to the proposals which the Commission will present in this field. The Commission appears to be the most suitable body to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some people describe Europe as a Europe which locks people out. They term it ‘Fortress Europe’. Those of us who want to create a humane Europe, which takes into account people with a need for protection, and who are seeking a humane asylum and refugee policy use the concepts of freedom, justice and security. I share the view of the Commission and the presidency that the current deficiencies in the field of asylum and refugees are linked to the problem that we have no common policy. At the moment, there are different policies in different countries. The policy we have to develop must be based on international conventions, needs for protection and family reunification. I also noted that, when it came to carriers’ liability, debated by Parliament at length during the last part-session, the presidency was to <span class="italic">take into account</span> the opinions of Parliament. At least that is the way I clearly understood it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we should distinguish between immigration of labour, and asylum and refugee policy. The latter is based on people’s need for protection. The former is based on the fact that we are suddenly realising that we will have a shortage of labour in the years to come, and here we are considering our need for labour. In this context, we talk far too little about integration policy, as linked to asylum and refugee policy is an integration policy where we look after those people who come here with a need for protection. Today, however, we are seeing these people remain largely outside society, that they do not have the same rights and that they are not utilised on the labour market. They tend to be found among the 14 million unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we talk about the immigration of labour – it is possible that there may be a question of this – I would primarily like to see us emphasising integration policy and a common asylum and immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just last Sunday, 447 Kurdish refugees landed in Greece. In February the “East Sea” freighter ran aground in St. Rafael in France with almost 1 000 Kurdish refugees, including over 300 children, on board. Their Odyssey to Europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions. Three women gave birth to children in these conditions. The refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the EU's segregation policy. It is intolerable. Europe’s borders must be open to people in need, fleeing their homeland. Why does anyone leave their homeland? Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland? No one leaves their homeland willingly unless they are being persecuted and fear torture and maltreatment. I think we should fight the reasons why they flee. We need an active human rights policy, we need to rethink arms exports and we need to give poor countries and regions financial aid, so that their people do not need to flee.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the European Union to apply this policy and put it into practice. Europe does not just need an economic face, it also needs a human face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is how we manage to adopt a Charter of Fundamental Rights and then not incorporate it into the Treaties, how we write in the Treaties that the Union must be developed as an area of freedom, security and justice, but then the good intentions are lost in conventions which are not ratified, in decisions which are not implemented and in the confusion that is created by the fragmentation of competences, initiatives and procedures. The governments raise hopes once again at Tampere and then dash them because they are unwilling to entrust the implementation to those whose job it is to concern themselves with the Union and not the internal affairs of individual States. Our action arrives late and is ineffective because Community initiatives come to a halt on the threshold of cooperation in matters of criminal justice, which are still dealt with on an intergovernmental basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be more courageous in protecting the rights of the citizens. In my opinion, there is one genuine solution which I hope will be adopted with the next Treaty: as is already the case for cooperation in matters of civil justice, every aspect of the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice must become Community responsibility. There is nothing to fear from this solution: the distribution of competences between Union and Member States would remain the same, but the effect of having standardised procedures would ensure that policies were coherent and also that the forthcoming enlargement of the Union would not, as it is in danger of becoming, be a barrier to the timely protection of citizens' rights.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, I want to draw the Council’s attention to the slowness and lack of coordination of some of its decisions regarding what was approved in Tampere, and I want to stress that this situation may lead to the failure of the agenda that you yourselves decided. What is needed is a new boost and greater political will to be able to fulfil the agenda and the objectives that are set out for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly I also urge you to work at developing the Tampere proposals and not Member State initiatives; although such initiatives are legitimate, this Parliament considers them lacking in coherence, partial in their presentation and content, guided by each country’s own situation, and not contributing at all to the overall view needed in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let me remind you that we already have a programme of initiatives presented by the Commission which, in my view, meets these requirements. Why do we not all focus on this programme? I must stress the need to combat illegal immigration and the vital importance of all the measures being taken to prevent the trade in human beings, the constant deaths in the Straits of Gibraltar, the fight against Mafia-like organisations and the exploitation of these people economically and in the workplace. All this has our support, but we must not lose sight of the need to adopt a balanced policy on the immigration question. Therefore, with the same determination and willpower we must all, including, of course, the Council, draw up and implement policies that truly integrate these citizens that live amongst us, and thus we shall avoid racist and xenophobic acts which regrettably and shamefully take place in the European Union. We shall avoid the tragedies that occur on the coasts of southern Spain every day, with boats laden with human beings reaching our shores and with people dying in their holds. For this we need a clear political will and sufficient budgetary funding.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I urge you to do, and I am certain that in this way we shall help build the area of freedom, security and justice we desire, and that we shall have the understanding and support of the European citizens in this important task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything was for the best in the best of all worlds. Everyone knew that there were several million illegal immigrants in Western Europe, everyone knew that they were coming in every day, trickling through our sieve-like borders, coming from all over the world, everyone knows the routes that they take and the main countries of entry, but at least, until now, all this has been going on quietly and discreetly, so as not to disturb good bourgeois consciences and the sleep of the self-righteous.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone finds their own particular satisfaction in this: this is how the pro-immigrant associations justify their existence, and the public subsidies that they enjoy. Governments end up regularising everybody, or almost everybody, thereby demonstrating their attachment to the essential values of tolerance, human rights and openness towards others. The bishops fill the desperately empty churches with illegal immigrants. Trades unions and industry find, thanks to immigration, the reinforcements that they so much require to make up for European workers’ lack of interest, and, of course, the bosses welcome the new labour force arriving on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it was an ill wind, and then suddenly, catastrophe: on 17 February, the cargo of the “East Sea” was deliberately beached on the French coast. On board were 912 illegal immigrants, of which 420 were children. And there you are, they landed, they are there, or rather – it has to be said – they <span class="italic">were</span> there. For the question we are asking now, regardless of the reasons why they were beached and the conditions in which it happened, is this: what has become of them? They have disappeared, melted into the background, over 600 of these illegal immigrants have miraculously vanished, they have done a disappearing act. For example, when the camp was closed by the prefect of Var, on 1 March, 449 people were supposed to have been taken into custody. Since then, more than 200 of them have disappeared. At Modane, the destination of the first people leaving via the Fréjus Pass, of the 82 Kurds welcomed with such ceremony, 40 have vanished into thin air.</p>
<p class="contents">But why has this happened? Why, when all the politicians, the various interest groups and others have all called unanimously for these immigrants to be permanently received here? Why, when the French government has arranged everything so well, giving them an eight-day pass of safe conduct so as to allow them to complete the formalities that will enable them to obtain official status as political refugees? Simply because these illegal immigrants preferred to use parallel secret networks for slipping into France and slipping out again.</p>
<p class="contents">What a psychological shock, what a cause for concern to the self-righteous. Unfortunately, this business is purely symbolic, it is a drop in the ocean, because every month there are thousands of illegal immigrants who succeed in getting into France. But others will follow, millions of others, who will arrive on foot and by train. Our problem is to organise their return to their own countries so that they can live and work in those countries with dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klingvall,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking you for an extremely interesting debate with many interesting questions, but, above all, I would like to thank you for your substantial commitment in the area of legal and home affairs. I will attempt to summarise and comment on your viewpoints and questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by making it clear that we are working for a union characterised by freedom, security and justice. None of us is interested in building a “Fortress Europe”. Rather our work is characterised by very great dynamism, a deeper cooperation in a Europe which we also wish to see enlarged.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the foremost aims of the Swedish Presidency is enlargement. It is to make this region larger, to integrate further countries into a deeper cooperation, not just for freedom, security and justice, but also for peace. This work obviously has considerable dynamism. We are working with countries around the Mediterranean and we are working on strengthening our cooperation with Russia and with China – to take just a few examples of the process that is going on and in which the Union is a powerful driving force in this cooperation and in the work on expanding this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This naturally also characterises our work on a harmonised asylum and immigration policy. In addition, it characterises the holistic perspective that we are imposing on the harmonisation work emanating from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions reached in Tampere. We want to have a modern immigration policy which means that not only do we work on eliminating the fundamental causes of involuntary migration but that, at the same time, we guarantee protection for those who are in need of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all been incredibly moved and affected by the tragedies and catastrophes that we have seen come to us on our television screens. This is a continuing and despicable trade. It exploits people in vulnerable situations. It is something that we must work against with considerable strength. However, we must do so in a number of different ways – one way is not sufficient. That is why work such as the increased cooperation with the candidate countries and the work to ensure that these countries, too, have a good legal system and a good asylum system is incredibly important with a view to preventing illegal immigration and preventing these tragedies. We must deal with the underlying causes of involuntary migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I was in the Balkans together with Commissioner Vitorino and the Belgian internal affairs minister, Mr Duquesne. We met representatives of five of the Baltic states in order to discuss precisely these matters. We accepted a far-reaching declaration incorporating this very holistic perspective that deals with both a legally secure asylum, reception and integration system and measures to achieve good border controls and an efficient visa policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as some of the practical questions are concerned with regard to what we are doing and what consideration is being given to the statements that have come from the European Parliament, allow me to shed light on just two matters. The first of these is the issue of human trafficking. Where this is concerned I want to make a clear distinction between human trafficking which exploits vulnerable people and what we call humanitarian acts. Humanitarian acts must not be punishable. We are working on a humanitarian clause concerning illegal entry. We have decided that, where illegal residence is concerned, the existence or otherwise of the profit motive will be the key factor in determining which acts are of a specifically humanitarian character and cannot therefore be punished. As far as the penalties are concerned: these must be severe. We have not yet reached agreement on this, but we are currently discussing a primary proposal for a minimum penalty of six years.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the question of transporters’ liability is concerned I wish to strongly reject what was said by Mrs Cederschiöld. Our exploratory work that is currently in progress provides a basis for reaching agreement on this in accordance with guidelines from the French Presidency. There are two viewpoints from the European Parliament which I, as President, have also brought into the discussions. The first issue is that transporters must not be punished where an asylum application is granted or when a person is granted residence for other reasons. This should mean that we defer the enforcement of fines on those who come to the EU and seek asylum despite the fact that they do not have adequate documents. Only when the asylum process is complete must those persons who are not allowed to stay be liable to pay these fines.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that was also included in the statement from the European Parliament concerns the fact that airlines and shipping companies can only be expected to discover obviously forged documents and people who lack any travel documents whatsoever. At the same time, it is, of course, reasonable for us to demand that transporters check passports and any visas. However, the sanctions must not be disproportionately severe. We do not yet know whether we will arrive at a solution that is acceptable to everyone, but we are sounding out the basis for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the contributions during the debate, such as the contributions from Mrs Terrón i Cusí and Baroness Ludford, dealt with the continued work. They wondered: “What is actually happening? You have this vision and the aim from Tampere, but what are you actually doing?” I reported on some of the decisions taken. I also reported on the status of the work in respect of some of the directives that are relevant. Allow me simply to emphasise that we hope that at our meeting in May we will be able to make decisions concerning the Directive on temporary protection and the Directive on the reunification of families. The negotiating work on these directives is currently progressing well. It is thus our hope that we will be able to make decisions in May.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also come a long way in respect of launching the Eurodac system. The test runs will be started in late summer 2001. We believe that this is a system which will be able to give us a more effective application of the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal for third country nationals’ rights, this has just been submitted. However, we look forward to being able to commence work on this directive as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I also mentioned earlier in the debate that the Belgian Presidency will focus on immigration policy and arrange a seminar on migration in October 2001. Spain, too, has announced a ministerial conference in respect of flows of migration from Asia in advance of its presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working patiently, step-by-step, so as to be able to realise the scoreboard that has been proposed with a view to implementing the conclusions of the Council’s summit in Tampere. The implementation work is still in its initial stages, but we are moving forward and naturally we want to make decisions as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only way in which we can fight this tendency is for the police and the prosecuting authorities to also work more at an international level and to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">All police work involves violating the integrity of those who are suspected of a crime. This is true both at national and at international level. It applies to people who are sought by the authorities. In order to be able to conduct a debate on the matter, it is important that we have the right basis. This applies, for example, to that which Mr Gahrton mentioned – namely the SIS system, which is there for wanted persons. Mr Gahrton said that the international SIS system charts people’s sexual orientation. This is incorrect! There is no such or similar sensitive information in the system. It contains information on persons who are wanted, whether they are armed, their descriptions and other things such as information on stolen vehicles. There is thus no such sensitive information and it is an incredibly important instrument if we are to be able to combat international criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of individual crimes that cannot be controlled unless we do so internationally, such as human trafficking, financial crime, IT crime or, as Mr Pirker mentioned, drugs crime. The only people who are served by having no international cooperation are the criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the matter addressed by Mr Pirker – drugs criminality – I agree that it is very important to have real action, that we go further than just spouting fine words without actually doing anything. Two incredibly important means of achieving this have been addressed today, i.e. the development of Europol and being able to establish international cooperation through Eurojust as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point to the work that is in progress for arriving at a solution in respect of synthetic drugs. I know that Mrs Cederschiöld has fought very hard on this matter, and hopefully we can reach some kind of political agreement in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson and Mrs Terón i Cusí, amongst others, have taken up the issue of how we can become more effective, which is, of course, important. It is important for instance when the proposals are put forward by the Member States and initiatives are taken on various matters. It is important that this is done in the right way and that we do not concentrate on short-term successes, for example at domestic level. It is in everyone’s interest for the cooperation to work and be effective. Everyone stands to gain, including from the domestic point of view, if it works as it should.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the cooperation between the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission. If this does not work it will create a negative impression. Our citizens will lose confidence in us and without the confidence of our citizens the EU will have no foundation, as a result of which the EU would not work either. Consequently it is important that this very constructive and important debate continues in the same way as it has done today. Finally, I would like to thank you all once again for this and for allowing me to come here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear from the Swedish Presidency that there is a real concern to have a balanced approach to policies in this area – a balance between those initiatives dealing with the repressive aspects and those which have a pro-active aim of encouraging a positive view of asylum immigration in our societies. Therefore, I hope that at the end of the Swedish Presidency we will have concrete and good results on the basis of which to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, to touch upon two points: first, on the action plan for Iraq, I share the view that it is extremely difficult to implement this action plan. The sooner we get a more detailed assessment of the concrete results of such an action plan, the better. We also have to bear in mind that one candidate country, Turkey, is a neighbouring country of Iraq. So we should engage Turkey more seriously in the debate on the Kurdish situation and on the effect of illegal immigration in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is to say to Mr Pirker that I did not touch upon the issue of drugs in my presentation, because there was no question tabled about it. However, I would draw the attention of Parliament to the fact that we are implementing the 2000-2004 Action Plan. There has been a very important Swedish initiative on synthetic drugs. We had an open debate in the Council on drugs and the Commission intends to present two main instruments: one, the framework decision for harmonisation of criminal law in fighting drug trafficking, will be presented next month. The second one is to put before the Council and Parliament what we call a follow-up table for the action plan on drugs. In that follow-up table we will include all the actions that need to be taken by the Union, and also identify all concrete actions that should be taken by individual Member States. So we are not neglecting the drugs issue. We did not touch upon that point, because you did not refer to it in the formal questions, but I am glad to announce to you our programme as far as combating drugs is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My final wish and hope is that maybe next year we will have a more cheerful debate on the state of play in the area of freedom, security and justice. Let us all work together to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
