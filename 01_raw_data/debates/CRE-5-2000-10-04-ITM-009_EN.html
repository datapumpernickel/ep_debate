<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, it may have passed some people by, but the fact that I am able to stand here and lead a debate on the Council's annual report on arms exports is really quite sensational, firstly because for years this Parliament called for a code of conduct in arms exports and was told it was an impossible dream. Yet we have a code, thanks largely to the initiative of the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, proof once again that where Parliament leads today, the Council will eventually follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when the code was agreed cynics said it was too weak and it would not work. Yet it is clear from the annual report that it has worked better than all expectations, including those of the Member State governments who approached this project with great suspicion. The code of conduct has led to greater mutual understanding, greater transparency and a greater convergence of Member States' policies. Furthermore non-EU countries are queuing up to associate themselves with the code. Clearly the more global the code the more effective it will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it was also feared that the code would be implemented in secret. Yet today, thanks to the Finnish Presidency, we are able to discuss the annual report. So great progress has been made in a short period of time. That I welcome and I congratulate everyone involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective and coherent EU policy on arms exports is essential if the EU is to pursue its external objectives, particularly given that we have so many areas of instability on our borders. You cannot claim to respect democracy and human rights if you do not act to stop weapons of murder and repression falling into the wrong hands. You cannot seriously pursue conflict prevention and peacemaking without controlling arms exports, particularly small arms. You cannot expect public support for peacemaking operations if our troops face death from weapons which we have ourselves supplied.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the European defence industries remain strategically and economically important to the EU. In order to survive they need to continue their consolidation and rationalisation. A common arms exports policy is essential to this process. That is why the framework agreement signed by the six Member States in July was so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the enormous progress made, there are areas where the code of conduct needs to be strengthened. The Council annual report itself identified the need for a common list of military equipment to be established. This was agreed in June and progress has been made on the list for paramilitary, public order, and internal security equipment. I wholeheartedly welcome these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The code, however, is only a political commitment between Member States. It should be legally binding. Article 7 of the code commits Member States to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users. Yet end user regulations vary enormously from country to country. They should be better coordinated and more effective. As a starting point we need a Community-wide database of information on licences and sensitive end users.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers. Yet most countries have little, if any, control over them. In my own country I would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed. This is wrong and I welcome the British Government's announcement last week that it is to stop. We need to control the activities of arms brokers throughout the EU. I was stunned recently to discover that there are up to 300 arms brokers in the south-east of England alone. Modern civilisation is rightly offended by this unregulated trade in death. That is why progress has to be made on the German presidency proposals to control arms broking. That should be a priority now.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the greatest safeguard against abuse of arms exports is transparency. The annual report is a large step forward but its transparency depends on the transparency of the national reports which it is created from. Some are better than others. Since 1997 my own government has published annual reports on arms exports which have been praised for their transparency. I urge all other governments to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend my report to the House. I urge the Council to act on my recommendations in order to enhance the EU's commitment to global peace and stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I still feel that this must be our approach, that we must not give in before the inevitability of war and conflict and that the defence policy must not provide for large-scale arms production, but that Europe must adopt an defence policy of intervention where it is not weapons that count but the ability to intervene peacefully in order to find non-violent solutions to disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, since I am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground, I will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation. I feel that it is important, as stated in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy itself, which is attached to the report, that the code of conduct – and we can deduce this from the annual report which we examined – has led to steps forward in the area of controlling and rationalising arms exports from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the Titley report is particularly efficient and highlights not only the merits but also the omissions, the innate limitations of the Council's report and of the feasibility of implementing the code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise certain points which appear to be particularly important: making the code of conduct legally binding, actively working towards drawing up an international code of conduct on the transfer of arms, making implementation of the code of conduct more transparent – in order to better assess its effectiveness – for example, providing information relating to the number and type of weapons for which licences have been granted and to the identity of exporting countries and countries of destination, conducting checks on intermediaries and brokers, putting an end to the current practice of selling European Union arms in areas of war or where human rights are blatantly violated. Another major point is the ban on exporting, promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is, in practice, to be used for the purposes of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a great many other important points, but I would just like to end by saying that transparency dictates a greater involvement of national parliaments at decision-making level and the participation of NGOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This statement focuses on the fear shared by the majority of our fellow Members, that arms of all kinds manufactured by the European Union may, if exports are not effectively controlled, be used by countries or armed groups that do not respect international law or human dignity. This is a not insignificant risk. The rapporteur was right to point out that, without such control, we have a situation where military personnel from EU Member States, acting in a peace-keeping capacity, have, in the recent past, been confronted by weapons manufactured and supplied by EU companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titley is right, however, to point out in addition that the future of the European defence industry, which is essential for pursuing the European Union’s peace and security objectives, will depend on the coherence between the policies of the Member states, particularly as regards exports, and that this should lead them to work towards drawing up and expediting the publication of a code of conduct based on the terms given in the legally binding agreement signed in July by six of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the objective of the Titley report, and that is why the Group of the European People’s Party endorses the report. That is also why it opposed those of the amendments tabled by our fellow Members in order to demand planet-wide general disarmament, with the European Union to set the example.</p>
<p class="contents">In consideration of the situation of the world today and of this continent, following the end of the cold War and the breaking of the balance established by the dread fear of weapons of mass destruction, such an attitude would be highly irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this dream, as you rightly termed it, Mrs Morgantini, still remains today in the realms of utopia, as I fear it will for a long time to come, we should, as proposed, highlight instead the positive results that have already been obtained by applying the code of conduct and propose all the measures that are desirable and applicable in order to improve the efficiency of this method. I believe the report under consideration will contribute to this objective. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this Parliament has always argued in favour of improving EU laws on arms export and, partly as a result of these pleas, we now have a code of conduct which we are able to debate today for the first time. The PSE Group sees this as a good start but a code is no law. We continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date, in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry. So, as far as we are concerned, we would emphasise the wording in Mr Titley’s report about also making the code legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley on his excellent report. He has scrutinised the code most comprehensively and has prepared a report for us which we can now readily discuss. One central point, of course, is that arms export policy should not develop in isolation. It must form an integral part of the common foreign and security policy. After all, it is an instrument of foreign policy which can and must contribute to the Union’s external policy which we would all like to bolster.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is currently developing a military arm within the second pillar. This requires more cooperation in the field of arms production and arms export. I hope that the bigger players in the arms export industry can see this as well. May the improved cooperation between six Member States, which came about recently, serve as a case in point. I would still like to underline that, within that framework, one of our objectives is to improve the so-called end-user regulation. We feel we should continue to work on this code and ensure that it can lead to a common arms export policy in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is also right to highlight a number of persistent problems in the field of arms export. The proliferation of light weapons remains disconcerting, even close to home, in the Balkans, for example. In a sense, these arms have come to symbolise anarchy in many areas worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU would do well to grant this more priority. There is of course also a direct link with organised crime, which is actively involved in the arms trade. This can only be tackled through increased cooperation. I wholeheartedly back Mr Titley’s plea to grant the candidate states a more prominent role. I would also like to include the Balkans in this. Much of the so-called illegal arms trade is channelled through these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Titley pointed out – rightly so – the code can be made more transparent by providing more and better information. I would like to underline this, also on behalf of my group. Unnecessary secrecy surrounding arms transactions must disappear. Here too we should continue to fight for more transparency. It is only by having hard facts that we can assess whether the EU Member States actually practise what they often preach, namely work on more security within and between countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are only faint rumblings in the background when it comes to armed conflicts and human suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">We must extend our study, on the one hand, not only to matters of binding agreements, but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes, voluntary disarmament, conversion, and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective, and, on the other hand, the applicant countries just mentioned by Mr Wiersma. The code of conduct, as part of a common foreign and security policy, will also be binding on the applicant countries. We would also like the important NATO country, Turkey, which is also an important market, to be mentioned in this connection. It is only by complementary action such as this that we can move towards a more sustainable security in Europe and the world, one that is founded on disarmament and stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall here simply discuss a quite special issue concerning the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital R of the report talks about the … ‘development of a common defence policy in the context of the CFSP and the establishment of a European Security and Defence Identity within NATO’, and paragraph 1 e talks about the EU’s weapons policy’s having to ‘contribute to the development of a Common Defence Policy’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are wordings which have to be totally unacceptable to those Member States which are non-aligned and which want to remain so. That applies to my own country, Sweden, and I accept that it also applies to other non-aligned States within the EU. Sweden does not believe that activity within CFSP can be described as a defence policy because it does not involve any common defence obligation corresponding to NATO’s paragraph 5. CFSP covers crisis management activity outside the EU’s borders and nothing which can be described as a common defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden participates actively, too actively I am inclined to say, in the development of a common weapons policy, but that is something different. The situation is not improved by Mr Titley’s writing about a common defence identity within NATO. As is well-known, Sweden is not a member of NATO. Nor, as far as I know, does it have any intentions of becoming a member.</p>
<p class="contents">All Swedish Members of the European Parliament obviously have to vote against the two above-mentioned wordings, and I also expect Parliament as a whole to reject them. If that were not to happen, the Swedish Government would, of course, have to lodge a protest against Parliament’s openly repudiating Sweden’s non-aligned status. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I read Mr Titley’s remarkable report with very great interest. If you allow me, I would like to elaborate on two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur lists four “essential criteria” which European policy needs to satisfy in the field of arms exports. The third criterion, the needs and challenges of the European defence industries, and to a certain extent criterion 4, the development of a common defence policy, are potentially and factually at odds with criterion 1, namely the consistency of the Union’s external action, whereby its objectives regarding conflict prevention and promotion of human rights prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the European arms industry needs to export, and these exports often end up in countries which are not serviced by successful competitors for a variety of political and strategic reasons. Unfortunately, practice has shown that these are often countries which should not be supplied with arms in the interests of conflict prevention. Think of the warring parties in Congo and countries in the Middle East. On the basis of this consideration, I would argue in favour of clarity: which criterion prevails in the event of the criteria quoted by Mr Titley clashing?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rapporteur is completely right in putting his finger on the sore point of supervision by national governments of the conduct of their own arms dealers. Not the slightest obstacle is put in the way of these dealers, as long as they only use the telephone to set up deals between parties in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A useful addition to Mr Titley’s practical proposals could perhaps be the introduction of a licensing system to finance the trade in weapons used in war, as well as to settle arms deals. Monitoring the money circuit is bound to make it more difficult to avoid arms trade regulations. At the same time, when the financial flows are monitored, it means that governments use one and the same yardstick, unlike in the present situation, where they are intent on monitoring the real flows whilst turning a blind eye to the virtual, financial flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this is an interesting and important debate. I apologise that I shall not be able to be here for the end of it, but I have already been struck by the number of contributions to the debate by people who know a great deal about the subject, including Mr Titley. I would like to thank him very warmly for the excellent report, which addresses a number of extremely complex issues. I can assure him that the Commission has read his report with very great interest and I hope that Member States have also done so, since so much of the action is in their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly stand ready to collaborate with the Member States to ensure that the report's recommendations are sensibly implemented. Mr Titley has highlighted an essential element of the CFSP. Indeed, as ESDP becomes operational, issues such as arms exports must be seen as forming part of a comprehensive approach. Our aim must be coherence and that I take to be a very important underlying message in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU code of conduct establishes a set of detailed principles governing conventional arms exports. These aim at preventing the export of weapons to governments which abuse human rights, to areas of conflict or to regions engaged in arms races.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments. But the arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy, with which of course the Commission is fully associated. The code has been in existence for one year and, as acknowledged in the first annual report, Member States' initial experiences of its operation during this period were positive. The code has already increased mutual understanding of Member States' policies, it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and it has encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions. It is undeniable, however, that there are grounds for further strengthening of the code and its implementation, as Mr Titley has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements. Any amendments to the code must enjoy the support of all Member States. In this respect we welcome the adoption of a common list of military equipment covered by the code during the Portuguese presidency, as requested by this report. The Commission services are currently exploring the possibilities of drafting EC legislation on non-military items to which the provisions of the code should apply. This would certainly include instruments which can be used for torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks after the adoption of the code, the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus plus Iceland and Norway issued a declaration aligning themselves with the criteria and principles in the code. Since then many of those countries have made considerable efforts to comply with the code. We share Mr Titley's concern that associated countries should take the necessary steps to attain European Union standards in the field of arms exports. The Commission services, in the course of their regular meetings with associated countries, continue to encourage them to abide by the code's provisions and fully implement its criteria and to monitor their compliance. Furthermore, the European Union is interested in broadening the acceptance of the main principles contained in the code so as to cover the world's main arms exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to combating the destabilising accumulation of small arms in many parts of the world. The Commission, in close collaboration with the Member States, was actively involved in the drafting of the European Union joint action on small arms and light weapons. We fully intend to strengthen policy in this area as part of a coherent approach. We agree with the rapporteur that further efforts are needed in establishing common rules for controlling the legal trade and for eradicating trafficking and smuggling in such arms. We are committed to providing financial and technical assistance to countries, international organisations, regional arrangements and NGOs, as proposed by the joint action.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of projects are currently in progress or under consideration. Under the EU project in Cambodia, technical, administrative and financial support is provided to the government and to selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the control, collection and destruction of weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is currently considering the continuation of the project beyond its expiry date in November of this year. We are also supporting Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa/Mozambique operation, on the collection and destruction of small arms. Other projects are under consideration in South Ossetia and West Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attaches great importance to the 2001 UN Conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. In this respect it is going to be necessary to build credible EU common positions in the coming months. We will continue to consult closely with our partners during the preparatory process and we will work together towards the adoption of effective guidelines for the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">These could result in politically or legally binding instruments and a comprehensive international programme of action for the small arms problem. The point I believe is to see our efforts in this regard as part of a comprehensive approach to arms policy in general and as part of the overall endeavour to make ESDP coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank the rapporteur again for his excellent report, which provides a great deal of useful guidance on how to develop our policy in this extremely important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
