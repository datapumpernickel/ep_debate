<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lienemann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">.</span></span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century. Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future. We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet’s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.</p>
<p class="contents">To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans. When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere. Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments. In this it said that in a few years’ time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances. Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened. This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s water policy is not starting from zero. Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives. The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation. However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs. For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved. In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.</p>
<p class="contents">We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us. Yet we do not have much time. We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again. It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time. The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time. It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner. Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading. Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero? Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive? Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water? Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples? The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schleicher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings. The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions. I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added. You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different. Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests. Even within my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion. Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions. In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position. Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament’s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament’s credibility. For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020. That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings. I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States. I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money. Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days. You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water. The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter. I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises. I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points. And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times. If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative. Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us. However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures. Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group. We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.</p>
<p class="contents">One example is water transfers. We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision. We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption. In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe. The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment. However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe. This brings home the connections which bind us together.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details. It is important for us to remember that this is a framework. These brushstrokes are indeed very broad. It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days. There are many opportunities to hide. The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come. That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail. The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept – the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation. I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing. This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle also concerns water charging. The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer to the political position here. The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading. Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless. It is a retrograde step. This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation. We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation. We have seen vote after vote lost. Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee. We have failed to achieve a qualified majority. Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed. We need to get into that conciliation position. We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated. Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances. </p>
<p class="contents">The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle. Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity. The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English. </p>
<p class="contents">This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency. That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve. It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading. This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes. The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak. The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance. This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances. Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable. This is what is meant by the term “close-to-zero”. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect. These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists. This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two substances from the Commission’s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT. On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively. The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems. For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance. A sound alternative would be to clean the ship’s sides mechanically. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas. Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete. As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council. We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently. There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented. The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy. This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used. Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming. The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee. We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended. We will therefore vote for the Greens’ Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report. My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens’ Amendment No 105. I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned. However, some people in our political group think otherwise. Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders. Water is a renewable but limited natural resource. It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas. The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community. We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive. It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean. We are not, fortunately, at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines. For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding. We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other. Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water. The water issue will definitely not be settled today. In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water. </p>
<p class="contents">It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework. With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU’s water legislation. But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies. More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised. </p>
<p class="contents">The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils’ objectives lack both commitment and ambition. The Committee on the Environment’s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation. However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability. Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.

It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed. </p>
<p class="contents">The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage. The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading. In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal. It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge. I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail. I would first of all like to focus on quality. The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy. A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality. In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question. Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words on quantity management. In his poem “<span class="italic">Herinneringen aan Holland</span>” [“Reminiscing about Holland”], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected. In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology. When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage. </p>
<p class="contents">This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right. Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too. </p>
<p class="contents">Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples. This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination. We need to recognise that water is a joint liability. Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident. Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream. Coordination is the key word here.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical. Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation. Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter. It is time for action. </p>
<p class="contents">In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague. This Forum stands for a worldwide vision. This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control. </p>
<p class="contents">The time for action is upon us. The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time. But we should not lower our standards too much either. The common position is not ambitious enough. This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives. We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020. This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too. </p>
<p class="contents">The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up. A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment. It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding. Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives. Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.

However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation. I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.</p>
<p class="contents">First OSPAR. We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment. Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough. What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR. Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law. Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR. But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth. We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices. Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention. With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive. Let us grab our chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned. The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas. I understand this. However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers. In my country – I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another. However, Mrs Lienemann’s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana. We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive. However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council. The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years. I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage. The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage. No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently. Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented. Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states. This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come. We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council’s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment. In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water. It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people. It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters. The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation. We cannot afford to wait. In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words “water pollution caused by individual pollutants” are replaced by “prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges”. We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment. The EU’s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment. This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the ‘polluter pays’ principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources. </p>
<p class="contents">This situation is loudly echoed in<span class="bold"> </span>many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector. The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income. </p>
<p class="contents">The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of<span class="bold"> </span>current conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater<span class="bold"> </span>from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning<span class="bold"> </span>of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage,<span class="bold"> </span>which is fundamental to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards. In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting. First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive. Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation. I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable. I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective. Compare it with what happens in December. We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents. But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years’ time. We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy. I emphatically support the rapporteur’s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution. The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives. It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances. This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature. Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment. European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread. As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs. I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of people do not even have clean water – a absolute necessity for survival – at their disposal. It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars. The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs. General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation. I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too. We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter. Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way. </p>
<p class="contents">The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements. The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years. By then, my children will be older than I am now. You have to admit: this is a joke. Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children. Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with this observation. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium. What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers. In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations. They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament’s more drastic positioning. I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient. We need to change tack completely. During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy. This can only benefit our credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
