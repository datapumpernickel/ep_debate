On 21 May, the police and paramilitary forces beat up and arrested participants in a peaceful opposition rally in Baku. The official excuse was that permission to hold the rally was denied and this despite an apparent order of 12 May from President Aliyev, instructing government authorities to respect freedom of assembly. Dozens of civilians were arrested in that incident and many journalists were beaten up by the police.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that the purpose of the rally was to voice the need for amendments to Azerbaijan’s election laws, in order to prevent the authorities from falsifying election results, to ask for the creation of an independent public broadcasting authority, and to demand the prosecution of the murderer of the independent journalist Elmar Huseynov, who was shot dead outside his apartment last month.</p>
<p class="contents">In other police operations, scores of known opposition activists, including the heads of youth organisations, were rounded up and mistreated. Parliamentary elections are due in November and it seems that a repeat pattern of violence instigated and carried out by the State is starting again, as it did before the 2003 elections.</p>

They have carried out privatisations and major cuts in the public sector, resulting in a large group of new poor people. This led to anything but European-style parliamentary democracies. The one-party states were replaced by small dictatorial profiteering cliques regarding themselves as answerable to nothing and nobody. In Ukraine and Georgia, popular movements against such authoritarian leaders received support from the West, and rightly so. In Belarus too, where such a revolution has not yet been successful, the opposition, though weak, can count on much external sympathy. This is in contrast to former Soviet Republics, including Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, where America has now gained major military and economic footholds, but where there has, to date, been no such external support for popular uprisings. The regimes’ opponents risk jail or the death penalty, and there is no chance of free elections. In the coming weeks and months, Europe will need to manifest consistent solidarity with the opposition movements that focus their efforts on democratisation from the inside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Corruption is endemic in Azerbaijan and the promise of wealth from its oil reserves is, as yet, unrealised. It suffers from terrible ecological problems in the Caspian Sea as a result of DDT and toxic defoliants used in cotton farming. It enjoys close military and political links with Turkey, and the EU has strong interests in securing the energy corridor that supplies Western countries with its oil and gas, and also maintaining Azeri cooperation in the fight against international terrorism in the face of recent allegations from Russian sources that Azerbaijan has supported Chechen separatists.</p>
<p class="contents">President Aliyev was elected in October 2003 in a contested and deeply-flawed election condemned by international observers. But Azerbaijan’s President has committed himself now to holding free and fair parliamentary elections this November. The 4 June opposition rally went peacefully, as just two weeks previously police had beaten back opposition protestors who tried to hold a rally in Baku despite an official ban, and dozens were arrested. The final decision regarding the location of the rally was taken after negotiations between the Baku mayor and opposition leaders, who have now warned of dire consequences if falsification is used again in the November elections. Some observers even predict that Azerbaijan will eventually see an uprising similar to those that occurred in the toppled regimes of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent unsolved murder of <span class="italic">Monitor Magazine</span> editor-in-chief, Elmar Huseynov, has raised accusations of government involvement and a relative of the exiled former speaker and opposition figure, Rasul Gouliev, the UK citizen Almaz Gouliev, has been arrested on the allegedly trumped-up charge of a pistol being found in her bag, apparently in order to deter Mr Gouliev from returning for the elections.</p>

<p class="contents">The main reason is the growing dissatisfaction, not to mention downright disillusion, with President Aliyev’s authoritarian regime. Worryingly, this popular discontent is finding an increasingly Islamic expression. Suffice to say that at the moment, 20% of Azerbaijanis favour the introduction of <span class="italic">sharia</span>, the Islamic law, and Azerbaijan does not have a Western outlook either. This significant internal dissatisfaction can be attributed to several causes. For example, the true unemployment rate, despite the oil and construction boom, is very high, being estimated at 20% to 30%. Furthermore, the current presidential government owes its dire popularity ratings to its practice of silencing the opposition in the electronic media, obstructing, where possible, the opposition’s public manifestations, and to a hardly representative voting system characterised by ballot-rigging. The latter is, in fact, a national tradition, which is taking on ever more refined forms these days.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the European Union, as one of Baku’s official partners, do anything at all to help Azerbaijan develop peacefully and democratically? What is called for in any event is clear language from Brussels about how reprehensible its government’s repressive practices are, as is close, European observation of the ballots in the parliamentary elections planned for November. I hope that the Council and Commission will be firm in calling President Aliyev and his political entourage to account about the enormous political risks of repressive policy not merely in a national, but also in a much larger, regional, context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no doubt even more difficult for some of the former autonomous republics of the Soviet Empire: the conflicts taking place at the moment in the three countries of the South Caucasus are largely due to the ghastly legacy of Stalin who, in his ‘divide and rule’ strategy, had reattached Ngorno Karabakh to Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the deadlock over Ngorno Karabakh is one of the main reasons for the stagnation of the region. As long as it remains unresolved, no prospect of development can be hoped for in that region, which is, however, a natural bridge between the European Union and Asia. Azerbaijan’s difficult economic, social and political situation is a direct outcome of this tense status quo, if only as a result of the large number of refugees and of displaced persons from within the country itself, who are a heavy burden on the country. Whilst there are renewed hopes of an improvement in the overall situation in the country, thanks to the opening of the Baku–Tbilissi–Ceyhan pipeline and the dividends accrued from extracting oil from the Caspian Sea, that in no way excuses the repressive attitude of the authorities towards the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan voluntarily made the decision to turn towards Europe by requesting accession to the Council of Europe. Europe laid down the rules of democracy for guidance. By first of all signing an initial Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 1999 and by integrating it in its new Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union then indicated its willingness to support Azerbaijan in its democratic process. Today, the Union has a right to expect progress along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst there is reason to be very pleased about the release of political prisoners and the presidential decree calling for international laws to be enforced with regard to respect for citizens’ democratic rights, the events that took place in Baku in May – the ban on meetings held by opposition parties and the arrest and imprisonment of opposition activists – are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that we wish above all to support our friends in the South Caucasus, in general, and in Azerbaijan, in particular, we call on President Aliyev and his Government to make every effort to ensure that the forthcoming legislative elections in November 2005 are conducted in a legitimate and transparent manner and that the opposition candidates can freely conduct their campaigns, in complete safety and with fair access to the media. That will be a powerful token of the government’s willingness to make a more in-depth commitment to the road to democracy, to which it had made an official commitment during the meeting with our parliamentary delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Azerbaijan, then, we have a relatively demanding programme; it is on the basis of our principles, our values and our rule of law that the Azerbaijani state, too, is to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The country report that the Commission has drawn up, which is intended to result, over the coming months, in plans of action, offers us the opportunity to give a shot in the arm to the process of democratisation and establishing the rule of law. While not using the same language in every instance, we should weigh our words when articulating criticisms and denounce really serious human rights violations for what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing of what I have just heard from my fellow Members about the increasing number of arrests, about the absence of free elections – as Mr Meijer said – or the introduction of sharia law in Azerbaijan, which really is a tragedy – gets to grips with the reality of what is going on there. We have to bear in mind in which region the country is situated. This week, we have been discussing Uzbekistan, a country where the government had between 400 and 500 civilians shot for going on a demonstration, and here we are talking about what happened on 21 May, when a few demonstrators were arrested and then released after a few hours, and then on 4 June, when the government gave permission for a demonstration by the opposition. That may well be nowhere near our idea of what democracy and the rule of law are like, but I think we have to bear these things in mind in our assessment of these events and in the language we choose when describing them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that we have to observe these elections. They are due to be held in November, and the European institutions must not make the same mistake that they did in Ukraine, where we did not at first take the elections at all seriously and did not follow their progress. Mr Solana, the High Representative, woke up to the situation only when the Ukrainian people took to the streets to demonstrate against the electoral fraud that had been going on.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that we in this House should, over the coming weeks and months, keep an eye on how this process progresses. We should send a delegation of observers and make use of the action plans now coming into force as a means of helping a country that is in a very difficult region, and parts of which are under occupation, yet which is determined to move towards democracy and towards becoming a good European neighbour. In so doing, we will be serving our own European interests, as well as democracy and the rule of law and human rights, better than if we were simply, with words of harsh criticism, to lay into countries with whose circumstances we are insufficiently familiar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I visited the region last month with Scottish Parliament colleagues, because we are keen to reach out to these countries with our experience of social democratic and civic nationalism. In that region, the events in one country all too often have serious ramifications in another. In that vein, I would commend to you in particular paragraph 10 of the resolution and the reference to the fragile civil society in Azerbaijan, because that is the key to a long-term solution for the region’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan, Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs, but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help, inspiration and perhaps even leadership. I hope this resolution will give an added impetus to the Union’s dealings with this troubled region and the positive experience that we can bring to its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The country’s huge wealth is in stark contrast to the growing poverty among its population. As mentioned by one of the previous speakers, those currently living as refugees still have no home, in contrast to the situation in Armenia, for example. The logical result of this social tension is the undemocratic measures taken by the government that are criticised in the resolution under debate. Of course, the aspect of the political system that has been the target of harsh criticism is the fact that it is possible to arrest large numbers of people for having participated in demonstrations or unrest, without any clear individual charges. That they were released is another matter. Journalists and opposition politicians were present among those arrested, and this is something that must be roundly rejected anywhere in the world. Releasing them, however, does not solve the problem, in particular when the country in question is a member state of the Council of Europe.</p>

This country is the latest in a series of Soviet republics to fight for independence, following Georgia and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At least several dozen protesters calling for democratic reforms in the country were arrested during the recent demonstration in Baku. Even prior to this, over 100 people had been sentenced to prison for expressing their political opinions and opposing the government, following the rigged presidential elections of 2003. A great many opposition activists, journalists, teachers and casual bystanders have been caught up in the wave of violence unleashed by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan is turning out to be a typical example of a country that has undergone superficial transformations. Its much-trumpeted democracy is nothing other than a facade behind which the totalitarian leaders of the Communist party have exchanged their party membership books for cheque books. They have amassed fortunes at the expense of society by manipulating people who have been deprived not only of their rights, but also of their property. As Pope John Paul II once said, the warped idea of freedom as entirely unencumbered liberty and licence still poses a threat to democracy and free societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of justice and truth, so we support the opposition’s demands that democratic principles and freedom of speech be respected and that there be no more intimidation or violence. We also support their calls for the punishment of those who murdered Mr Huseynov and Mr Djalilov, those members of the opposition who died in unexplained circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If only it could! The situation in this country is worrying. Not long ago a leader of the democratic opposition died in mysterious circumstances, following the death of another opposition leader earlier this year. At the same time, however, even tragedies of this kind and other forms of persecution, such as the arrest of 29 opposition activists in mid-May, do not alter the course of history and cannot reverse its tide. The 70 000-strong crowd of demonstrators last Saturday in Baku was well aware of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight for democracy in Azerbaijan is also a fight for stability, of which there is an urgent need in the country. To put it bluntly, Azerbaijan is a major centre of Caspian Sea oil production, particularly since the opening of the USD 4 billion pipeline between Baku, Tbilisi and Ceyhan in Turkey, which will reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The pipeline’s target capacity is one million barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p class="contents">Five days ago, following the recent demonstration, the leader of the opposition party Musavat said that Azerbaijan deserved democracy and was out to get it. He was speaking the truth, and the European Parliament should help ensure that this is what happens.</p>

However, the new economic challenges which are arising must be followed by a series of reforms at political and social level. Otherwise, they will lead the country to results which are the opposite of those anticipated, such as even greater unemployment and a wider social gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan must make good use of these developments and move towards democratisation. We urge the Azeri Government in the motion for a resolution to respect democratic values, including the right to a different opinion, and to start an open dialogue with the opposition, in accordance with the undertakings which it has given within the framework of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. A political environment needs to be created which will foster political pluralism, in order to ensure that the elections next November are conducted democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">We roundly condemn the murder of the journalist Elmar Huseynov, the ban on rallies, such as the recent rally cancelled by the Mayor of Baku on 21 May, and the cases of infringement of judicial independence, and we call on the country to dynamically promote institutional, legal and administrative reform.

We are following the events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, the media and the right of expression and assembly. We are also closely monitoring preparations for the November 2005 parliamentary elections and urging the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that they are conducted in full compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have asked if we should send a team of observers to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan. In line with standard practice in the OSCE region, a European Union election observation mission will not be deployed for the elections in Azerbaijan. Instead, support will be given to the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission that is to be deployed. The Commission will also consider whether, in line with recent actions and in connection with the elections in Ukraine, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, financial support can be provided to the OSCE/ODIHR fund in order to widen participation in election observation missions, to enable more observers from central, eastern, south-eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">All these issues and activities must be seen against the background of Azerbaijan’s inclusion in the European Neighbourhood Policy, as decided by the Council in June 2004. At its meetings with the Azerbaijani authorities, the Commission has always stressed that the European Neighbourhood Policy necessarily implies sharing fundamental values such as democracy, respect of human rights and the holding of genuinely democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, on 25 April 2005 the General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to offer Azerbaijan the opportunity to develop an ENP Action Plan with the European Union and I hope that will be finalised before the end of this year. Human rights, fundamental freedoms, genuinely democratic elections and democratisation will be amongst the main priorities of this document, which will provide overall guidance for future relations between Azerbaijan and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is assisting Azerbaijan with its institutional, legal and administrative reforms through the TACIS programme. This whole range of issues is one of the two main priorities chosen for the TACIS National Action Programme 2004-2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission is also providing financial support through its European initiative for democracy and human rights. Five regional projects are currently being funded in the southern Caucasus for a total amount of over EUR 5 million. The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to pursue effective protection of human rights in Azerbaijan and to make sure that the democratisation of the country progresses smoothly in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
