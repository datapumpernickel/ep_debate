<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Almunia,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the price of oil has risen considerably this year, reaching historic highs – in dollars – in nominal terms. Its impact on the economy is largely due to the marked rise of recent months, since, if we take account of the evolution of the euro-dollar exchange rate and inflation, the current level of real prices, in euros, is comparable to that of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The expectation in the very short term is that the price of a barrel of oil will remain high, due to the greater than expected rise in demand, particularly the demand from the large Asian countries and, in particular, China, and due to a lack of additional capacity to increase supply in the short term and to global and regional political uncertainties, particularly the conflict in Iraq of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The upwards tendency has furthermore been exacerbated by certain speculative movements, attracted by the price volatility resulting from the uncertainty factors I have just mentioned. This increase is clearly having a negative impact on growth during 2004 and on the growth forecast for next year. The oil price in dollars is now 60% higher than was forecast six months ago, when the Commission published its spring economic forecasts. Tomorrow, the Commission will publish its autumn economic forecasts, which include an estimate of the oil price, which of course is greater than the estimate six months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the ECOFIN Directorate-General’s econometric simulations model, if the price of a barrel of oil stays at 50 dollars – and today I believe a barrel of Brent stands at over 51 dollars – the effect would be an accumulated growth loss over three years of almost one point of gross domestic product, if the price of a barrel remains at 50 dollars throughout that period. In fact, the economic forecasts the Commission will present tomorrow have been based on the assumption of a higher oil price than in the spring, although it is also the case that, with regard to the estimates of the macroeconomic model, our forecasts for the evolution of the oil price for 2005 and 2006 are slightly more optimistic. We are not, therefore, expecting this level of 50 dollars to be maintained, but rather we expect it to decrease gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, despite this negative impact, the European economies are in a position to endure this price increase, thanks, in particular, to two factors. On the one hand, the real price of oil – as I have said – is considerably lower than previous highs. Not only is it no higher than that of 2000, but it is also very much lower than the high reached in real terms in 1981 and is also noticeably lower than that reached in 1973, more than 30 years ago. Furthermore, the European economies, over the intervening 30 years, have considerably increased their energy efficiency, reducing their dependence on oil when compared to the eighties, which makes us less vulnerable to increases in energy prices. In addition to this, the significant changes to the nature of salaries in the European economies, which are now less linked to the evolution of prices, must lessen the secondary effects of the increase in energy prices or inflation, which the President of the European Central Bank has mentioned this afternoon. Unlike in previous crises, so far at least, inflation is not expected to increase, despite the increases in oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we must recognise, Mr President, that certain sectors are being particularly affected as a result of their characteristics and specific circumstances, and I am referring, of course, as does the title of this debate, to agriculture and fisheries. The Commission is perfectly aware of the specific difficulties that arise in these sectors as a result of increased fuel prices. In both cases, producers in the agricultural and fisheries sectors have little capacity to pass on increases in their costs through their prices. There is therefore no doubt about the need for specific action and the Commission, in response to last week’s request from the Eurogroup, has agreed to present the Eurogroup and Ecofin with a report next month on the measures States may take in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, without thereby violating the legislation in force in the field of state aid and respecting the principle which we believe to be essential in the Economic and Monetary Union, which is that individual initiatives by Member States must be coordinated in order to prevent distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as asking the Commission for this report, the Finance Ministers once again emphasised the need not to adopt unilateral measures and for any possibility of measures affecting competition to be dealt with firstly by means of a prior consultation and coordination mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Before ending my first speech, I would like, if you will allow me, to stress two elements relating to the European economy in a more general sense. Firstly, I should stress that the appropriate polices for ensuring the stability of the energy supply are being adequately applied and coordinated at international, Community and national levels and, naturally, we must make it very clear that there is absolutely no reason to fear problems with energy supply in the industrialised countries, since the current level of strategic oil reserves, both in the United States and in the European Union or in other OECD countries, will allow us to deal with problems with the supply of crude over a long period of time, should they arise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember this, since the perceived risk of a possible scarcity of crude oil in the future is contributing to high oil prices, and I do not believe this fear to be justified given the way the market operates and the level of strategic reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and looking to the future, it is important that we continue with the reforms initiated in the past within the European Union with a view to improving our energy efficiency, because in that way we will improve the capacity of our economies to deal with external economic disturbances, such as this rise in oil prices, and, at the same time, by adopting these energy efficiency measures, we will increase the long-term growth potential of the Union's economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular – and the Commissioner has mentioned this – the consequences for the fisheries sector are extremely serious, and neither the Community institutions nor certain Member States, including my own, I regret to say, are taking any measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament has decided not take any action either, preferring a mere Commission statement to committing ourselves to a resolution, as proposed by our political group.</p>
<p class="contents">This statement today is of little or no use to fisheries, because we already know Commissioner Fischler’s opinion, which is that we should pass the rises on to the consumer. The problem is that the Commissioner – and I am delighted that you have said quite the opposite today, Commissioner – did not know that this solution was impossible for the fisheries sector, since it is governed by a system of Dutch auction.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is very different, Mr President. The oil price crises of 1993, 1994, 2002 and 2004 show that this is not a problem specific to the current situation, but a cyclical problem, and we must work on the basis that cycles will become shorter and shorter, since we are talking about an exhaustible energy source.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, dealing with a structural deficiency which must be dealt with through structural measures. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore calling for the implementation of a Community instrument which can be mobilised almost automatically during these periods of crisis. Furthermore, however, we need urgent measures for supporting the sector until that instrument becomes part of Community legislation; and we propose that these measures include the granting of low-interest or zero-interest loans and setting a maximum price, compensation in line with the real price by means of financial measures and temporary reductions in social and fiscal burdens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The present price rise appears not to be simply a short term or speculative rise; on the contrary, it also reflects structural changes which may well result in multiple reviews of the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth of the Tiger economy and a series of geopolitical factors are among the factors which have caused the present oil-triggered disorder in the economy. Consequently, it is not at all impossible that oil prices will stabilise at much higher levels than those which we considered normal in the past. For the European Union, the Commission itself has stated that a 25% increase in the price of oil this year will reduce the rate of growth by 0.17%.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these negative developments, there is an urgent need for the Commission and the Council to proceed with immediate action and medium term interventions. In a period of economic recession, of inflationary pressure and of pressure to re-examine the financial policy of the Stability and Growth Pact and the effectiveness of the support mechanisms for the Lisbon agreement, we cannot confine ourselves, Commissioner, to declarations and statements that, basically, everything is fine. The European Parliament would like to re-examine ways and means – there is a detailed analysis of the repercussions of the already enhanced oil prices on economic growth in the individual sectors, such as transport, agriculture, trade and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we should stress that nearly all the budgets of the Member States have been prepared on the basis of an oil price of USD 29. Secondly, we should stress the need to configure a stable and effective European framework for dealing with upward trends and sudden fluctuations in oil prices. Thirdly, we should stress the need to develop and activate a plan for dealing with the crisis and creating an efficient framework for preventing any crises which may affect the new stability pact. Fourthly, we should stress the need to avoid speculative market trends. Fifthly, we should stress the need to support vulnerable social groups, as this will mitigate the reduction in their income and prevent their social and economic marginalisation. Finally, we need to stress the need for financial support for farm holdings and businesses, which are already bearing the burden of the increase in production costs, which they truly cannot pass on to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in closing to stress that any delay in taking immediate initiatives will contribute to the emergence, as we have seen in the Council, of isolated national measures, and I should like to stress here that different national economic and political approaches must not be allowed to affect the degree of application of unified Community policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These increases have a direct impact on wages for crews, as well as on companies’ profit and loss accounts. As you said, these companies can barely, if at all, pass the increase on to the selling price of fish, given the specific nature of this market.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous crisis which occurred ten years ago had an avalanche effect, weakening management and financial structures in the sector and thus seriously jeopardising the economies of affected regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation we are facing today is comparable in the economic and social distress it is causing. The governments of the Member States are endeavouring, or will endeavour, to confront this situation by taking measures which comply with Community regulations, as you said. These measures, however, can do nothing but maintain the current state of affairs, and they cannot claim to provide an effective and lasting solution to the economic problems caused by high fuel prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community approach, which is focused almost exclusively on, and I quote, ‘the sustainable management of fisheries resources to preserve the interests of future generations’, is no longer credible as it stands, as there is a risk that it will result in a situation where the European Union is no longer able to exploit these resources due to a lack of workers experienced in the field. Under these conditions, how can we work towards the real goal of our common fisheries policy, which, as I see it, is for it to act in tandem with the common agricultural policy to maintain our continent’s capacity to produce sufficient food?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Almunia, my question is that which I prepared with my fellow members of the Committee on Fisheries; will the Commission undertake to act on behalf of the most seriously affected areas? For example, does it intend to put forward proposals to allow measures to be taken under the existing Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, or under the future European Fisheries Fund, or under any other mechanism, to improve the economic situation and to thus preserve the future of regions which have no real alternative? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rocketing cost of fuel could be the final straw for many businesses – and a fishing boat in Scotland very often is a business, a family-run business – which have been forced by the CFP to operate this year for only 15 days each month.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EU governments apparently recognise the exceptional economic pressure which rising fuel prices puts upon the fisheries sector. Recently France, supported by at least four other Member States, saw it as a long-term Community mechanism for granting public aid to the sector. This initiative was opposed – unsurprisingly – by the UK, citing the need to respect state aid and competition rules. I think the real reason for the UK failing to support that proposal was, as usual, that it did not wish for any precedent which might require it to aid its fishing industry – which it never does.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler, regrettably, was also unsympathetic, apparently saying that fisheries, unlike the agriculture sector, could easily respond to the fuel price increases by increasing fish prices. That is all very well, but what about the consumer, and what about the fact that fish products are relatively healthy and are recommended by dieticians to consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">The agriculture sector in Scotland is also suffering greatly from high fuel costs, not just through the direct use of fuel on farms, but also owing to the excessive cost of sending their produce to distant markets, an economic pressure which the UK Treasury has also added to in the form of unjustly high levels of taxation. But it is people and communities and not just businesses that suffer. The <span class="italic">Orcadian</span>, the newspaper of the Orkney Islands, reports a 67% rise in the price of fuel leading to an overspend by Orkney Ferries. Sometimes in the Orkney Isles, the Shetland Isles and the Western Isles it is normal and indeed essential for people to take two ferries to get to work or to shop. This is not just affecting businesses, it is impacting on a whole community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why has the Commission been caught unprepared? Why have you allowed things to develop in such a bad way for European households, industry and fisheries? Did the Commission not see how much the map had changed over recent years? Did it not see the intervention of the United States? It is controlling Iraq's oil through the invasion. It is controlling Saudi Arabia's oil by controlling the royal family. It is controlling Libya's oil by holding Gaddafi hostage. It is controlling Venezuela's oil by trying to destabilise Chavez. It is controlling Russia's oil through its customer relations with Putin. It is controlling oil and playing games with oil to the detriment of the European Union and to the detriment of China. A China desperately in need of oil (one in twelve barrels produced go there) and a Europe which, with its overpriced currency and with oil at USD 55, has particularly unaffordable and expensive goods which no longer even get near the shelves. You will see huge problems soon. Chryslers will flood Europe; there will be fewer Renaults, fewer Mercedes, fewer Fiats.

According to the predictions of certain analysts and economists, in the next few months the price may rise to USD 70 or 80 per barrel. The results of such an increase include a massive rise in costs in all areas, in particular in transport, agriculture and the areas to which reference has already been made today. A further slow-down in economic growth has ensued too. This can be estimated using the following simple formula: if the price of a barrel increases by USD 5, economic growth will fall by 0.3%. The increase has also resulted in a strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the other currencies of the European Union, as well as in disequilibria in the balance of payments of the major importing countries and, finally, in the European Union becoming less competitive and moving further away from the goals of the Lisbon strategy. Polish farmers were delighted to receive their first payments from the Union. Unfortunately, they are already aware that these payments will mainly be used not to develop farms, but to cover the cost of increases in fuel and fertiliser prices. The world did not anticipate these price rises, and the European Union did not anticipate them either when it planned its long-term policy consisting of programmes for the replacement of natural fuels by alternative and renewable fuels. Rapid measures should be taken to amend and accelerate the 2000 programme in the same way that America has done in the case of biofuels, with the country now using 10% biofuels in petrol and producing 70 million tonnes of them every year. A further example is that of the German economy and the production of electricity. Particular encouragement should be given to the production of biofuels, an increase in which would be the simplest and quickest way to limit imports. That would improve the European Union’s balance of payments both by increasing the number of jobs in rural areas, by accelerating the development of the much-feted multifunctional agriculture and also by raising profitability in agriculture, making it independent of the suffocating support system of subsidies. Now is the time for us to make a rapid change of policy to one that makes us independent of price rises, oil imports and excessive greenhouse gas emissions, and now is the time for us to choose the path of environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it is clear that the primary production sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the most acute problems. This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate, in which we have bitten off more than we can chew. We should therefore focus on these two subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties, and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this. Within a little over one year, fishermen have seen the price of diesel oil double, with approximately one litre of fuel needed to catch one kilo of fish. This is why, together with the other Members of this House, I was quite literally shocked and appalled at the statements made by the Commissioner for Fisheries, in which he said that one need only pass the rise in the price of fuel on to the price of fish in order to solve the problems. This is of course impossible, and it is an example of the very kind of flawed reasoning which will dissuade consumers from buying fish, the very food we wish to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis of 1993-1994, which caused a widespread breakdown of structures, was that extremely rapid action will be needed. The proposals we have just heard, in particular those put forward by Mrs Fraga and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, include placing a ceiling on the cost of diesel oil, reducing financial, social and tax costs and, most importantly, providing monetary advances which correspond to the needs of fishermen experiencing very serious problems, of whom there are already a large number. This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing. In other words, there is a need for both measures taken at European level during crisis periods and national measures adapted to local situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are two strategic sectors in terms of maintaining jobs and of the Union’s food supply. As Commissioner Almunia has acknowledged, both sectors have difficulties passing the rise on through their prices, something which Mr Fischler appears not yet to have understood.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is our duty – and the Commission's duty – to act diligently in crisis situations. In this respect, I would like to say to Commissioner Almunia that we do not want to return to the scenario of 2000, when the Commission decided to declare the State aid received by those professionals illegal and demand that it be returned. Such a situation would damage the credibility of the institutions, not just the Community institutions, but national institutions as well. In this regard, I agree with the Commissioner on the need to adopt a mechanism capable of responding to the situation at Community level, since it is endangering two of our most sensitive production sectors. I do not think it is asking too much to wait for a month if that allows us to create an appropriate Community framework capable of establishing the scope and duration of any measures adopted by either the European Union or the different Member States, this being the only way, we believe, to prevent any problems of distortions of competition which could arise if each Member State adopts them individually. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we consider a case I know well – that of Spain – this rise has led to very great losses for producers and no national compensation measures have been put in place to alleviate them in good time. The Spanish farmers are very concerned about the Spanish Government’s failure to act in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week a draft was presented in this House calling for a parliamentary resolution in favour of long-term measures aimed at reducing the farmers’ dependence on diesel.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft – the only one I have seen in relation to agriculture – was not accepted, which I believe can be interpreted as a lack of solidarity on the part of this House towards the farmers, one of the two sectors – together with the fisheries sector – which are least protected against price rises because in neither case can producers pass this increase on through their prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to resolve this problem, I propose five measures: firstly, the Member States should take measures in a coordinated fashion in order to prevent distortions of competition between neighbouring countries; secondly, the European Commission should be as benevolent as possible when authorising national aid; thirdly, the European Union, once and for all, should give mature consideration to the resources available to deal with the crises which have been arising for years – let us remember 1993-1994, 2000 and that all these years in which oil prices have risen have been devastating for producers; fourthly, in relation to the issue which was aborted in the Conference of Presidents last week, I proposed calling on the European Union to bring forward the report it has to produce on aid for fuel production with a view to revising the Community legislation as soon as possible, in order to reduce the dependence of farmers and the European Union on oil; and fifthly, as a final measure, I also propose that this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture produce a report with a view to seeking viable long-term solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increase in the price of oil has resulted in general price rises in our country too. As a consequence, economic growth has slowed down, the budget situation has become uncertain and agricultural competitiveness has deteriorated because, unfortunately, the agriculture of countries with poor energy sources consumes a lot of energy, and employment and social achievements thus become jeopardised. Living costs increase and poverty deepens. It is a sad picture. The unreasonably high oil price endangers global economic growth, and I can only emphasise what Commissioner Almunia said, that the main reason for price increases, namely international speculation, must be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">A combined European effort is needed not only for this, but also for turning the dream of a welcoming Europe into a reality, despite the problems. In a collective effort, the institutions of the European Union must therefore help prevent crises brought about by price increases. They need to increase the proportion of renewable energy so that they become more independent of the oil market. Furthermore, they must help create an observation system that analyses the oil price movements and determines the strategic level of oil reserves. All this is planned for the future by László Kovács, Commissioner-designate, whose expertise has been called into question by some people in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must never forget that crude oil has been, and still is, the cause of many economic conflicts, not to mention the detrimental effects that its extraction, processing and use have on the environment. Nor must we ever forget that we are dealing here with a finite resource. It is high time for Europe to free itself from economic dependence on oil imports.</p>
<p class="contents">High oil prices have an adverse effect on agriculture and mean substantial losses of income for our farmers. The targeted use of renewable energies is now more necessary than ever before; not only does the use of renewable raw materials significantly help to protect the environment, but it also offers new alternative sources of income for our farmers. Above all else, though, it is the right way to become self-sufficient in energy, so we have to push for the voluntary Europe-wide admixture of biofuels, which is a half-hearted solution, to be made mandatory. In this Directive, the interests of the oil industry have prevailed to a large extent, while the goals of the Kyoto Protocol, more secure income for our rural areas and an opportunity to create more jobs, including in the outermost regions, have lost out.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our responsibilities to future generations demand of us that we press for the more efficient promotion and mandatory admixture of renewable energies right across Europe. If now is not the time to do this, then when is? So, equipped with new and smart energies, let us go on the march into the future! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fuel prices seem to follow fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar, at present the currency of a country at war. Why do we not quote these prices in euros, as Mr Karlsson proposed in his report? Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats overturned the report on emergency supplies in this House a little under a year ago. Perhaps the present energy problems in the United States and Europe have woken us up. The unstable situation in Africa, the Middle East and Russia has resulted in problems in the supply of oil. Not only ourselves, but the United States, Japan, China and India all compete for Russian oil. We must ensure that we have a steady fuel supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should prepare for long periods of high prices by introducing interim fiscal solutions, stockpiling supplies, which we need, exploiting new sources of energy, and reduced and more efficient consumption. When Mr Karlsson’s report was overturned, Parliament called on the Commission to draft a new proposal on the matter. When does the Commission intend to put this proposal forward? It is obviously necessary for us to reduce our dependence on oil and develop new energy sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be hard to think of a more topical issue. Today, for example, we have heard about farmers making it difficult to store and refine oil in France, where they are demanding, in a typically French way, complete exemption from tax on fuel used in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in the news too the critical stage which the industrial dispute in the Norwegian oil industry has reached, and that has put up the price of crude oil in the Nordic countries. Examined in historical context, the current price of oil per barrel, which is more than USD 55, easily exceeds the 40 dollar level, which it was thought would significantly slow down global economic growth. If current price levels are maintained, forecasts for the global economy may well have to be adjusted downwards. If the situation continues for a long time, it will also become a problem for us.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, however, we should keep our composure. The long-term rise in oil prices is not just the result of recent events, but of strong economic growth in China and the countries of South-East Asia, which in itself is a positive thing. Low stocks in the United States and political instability in the Middle East have also had an impact. Furthermore, when we consider the American presidential elections and many other political factors, such areas of speculation have now contributed to price pressures, although they are not directly linked to any real oil shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">The only means by which we can have an effect on the price of oil or any other form of energy in the long term is to ensure that European energy policy is sufficiently diverse in scope. Specifically, we need to support a diverse energy mix that includes all the main forms of energy, especially nuclear power. Dependence on oil is also a very difficult issue from the point of view of relations with Russia, as Mr Paasilinna, for example, has just said. Russia sells energy wherever it can obtain the best price for it, and China and India, as major consumers, have the advantage over Europe here. We should not, therefore, rely on imported energy. Instead, we must ensure that we produce a greater proportion of our energy in Europe ourselves, at a reasonable cost, and in a way that is environmentally sustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the assessment of what is happening and of what is going to happen in relation to the evolution of oil prices and its impact on the European economy in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must insist once again on the need to be realistic when assessing this impact, and in the case of this crisis, of this rise in the oil price, which is very significant in terms of dollars, the impact on European economies is much less significant than in previous crises. We must not, therefore, exaggerate the general impact on the economy, despite the particularly noticeable and socially painful consequences for certain specific sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe we must be prudent when assessing the possible evolution of the oil price, by making judgments on what that evolution may be. It is true that some economists are talking about 60 and 70 dollars, but it is also true that the futures markets are operating on the basis of a reduction of the current level of 50 dollars per barrel and that the market operators are, therefore, not anticipating further rises in the petrol price, but rather a tendency over the next two years for the market situation to moderate, given that, as some of you have said, the proportion of the rise in the oil price over recent months does not correspond either to the objective situation of supply and demand in the market nor to the other geopolitical factors influencing the situation, but to speculative operations which cannot be maintained permanently over time.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to be prudent and realistic when assessing a situation which, in any event, is not a positive one and which, as I said at the beginning, and as many of you have repeated, has a negative impact on growth and on the evolution of prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I entirely agree with those of you who have insisted on the need to continue moving ahead in relation to our energy efficiency and on policies to reduce our dependence on oil as an energy source. I believe that the European Union has made significant advances in this respect over the last 20 or 25 years and that we must continue to make progress in this direction and intensify where necessary – and I believe it is clearly necessary in relation to certain aspects – common actions at European level in relation to energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, while I said earlier that, if the price of a barrel of oil remains at 50 dollars over the next two years, until the end of 2006, this would have an impact on the European Union’s economy of a reduction in growth of around one point, the impact on the United States’ economy would be much greater, because their level of dependence on oil as a primary energy source is much greater than that of the European Union countries. And of course, given that the impact of oil prices is negative, but is not spread equally across the different sectors of our society or the different production sectors, as many of you have pointed out, it is clear that we need to redistribute our efforts in order to deal with the situation of the sectors suffering most from the rise. And the majority of you who have referred to this unequal distribution of efforts have referred, quite rightly, to the fisheries sector, firstly, and also to agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">According to which rules and within which framework should we deal with this distribution of efforts or this particularly intense compensation in the sectors most suffering as a result of the rise in oil prices? I would like to repeat three criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, attention must obviously be paid to the principle of coordination – it benefits nobody to take unilateral measures at national level on issues which should be decided at European level, whether by the Ecofin Council or by the Agriculture Council. On the 18th, the Agriculture Council began to analyse this issue and in the first debate the positions of the different Member States were not unanimous. It is, therefore, true that the Commission must draw up initiatives and the new Commission – which I hope is confirmed next Wednesday – as the honourable Members are aware, will not just have a new Commissioner for Agriculture, but also a Commissioner specifically dedicated to fisheries, Mr Borg, and a new Commissioner for Energy, as the honourable Member said.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Commission's initiatives, however, a consensus must be created at Council level both in terms of coordination, which is the responsibility of the Ecofin Council when it comes to measures of a fiscal nature, and in terms of any measures which may be adopted at the level of the production sectors, which were discussed during the first debate on the 18th. There was no full agreement amongst the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are all aware that we are going to have to continue discussing this issue over the coming months, but I will repeat what I said at the beginning. We must do so in the knowledge that, structurally, the oil market is never going to be what it was ten, twenty or twenty-five years ago, amongst other things because there are new energy consuming countries with extraordinary economic potential and with a very high level of growth, but the direction taken by European energy policy is the right one and we must not change that direction but rather enhance it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this figure is fluctuating, the tendency is upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">This rise is the result of a complex series of factors, including the invasion of Iraq, political and social instability in some of the big exporting countries, natural disasters, increased demand in countries with large populations and strong economic growth, and also speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Monetary Fund says that a USD 8 per barrel rise will cause a 0.5% fall in economic growth. Consequently, whilst the downturn is not as severe as that of the seventies and eighties, the risks to the world economy and to its much-trumpeted upturn are enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">The first sectors to be affected by these oil price rises have been transport, fisheries and agricultural. These sectors, particularly the last two, are already severely depressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, Community restrictions on direct public aid to the sectors affected should be lifted, and measures should be taken and practical support provided at EU level in order to minimise the socio-economic impact of oil price rises.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue, however, is much broader and more structural, and is due to the fact that the world’s economy has never resolved the problem of its dependence on a resource that is finite and subject to speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The consequences of this increase will be felt in particular by poor households during the winter, unless there are direct measures to provide them with financial support to cope with heating bills.</p>
<p class="contents">The spiralling increase in the price of 'black gold' is leading to a new, general wave of increases in the prices of widely consumed goods, on top of the constant price rises which have significantly eroded workers' incomes. At the same time, the profits of the multinationals operating in the sector are multiplying at a rapid rate, the concentration and centralisation of capital is intensifying, to the detriment in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises and capital restructurings are being reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in the consumption of energy in developing countries and the wars and escalations which the monopolies themselves cause are a pretext for increasing prices. The real reason lies in the exploitation of productive resources for the benefit of the plutocracy and in the strengthening of it within a climate of generalised privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The only response to high prices is to be found in the fight of the workers against this barbarity and for radical change and for energy and other strategically important sectors to become the assets of the people and satisfy the contemporary needs of the workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
