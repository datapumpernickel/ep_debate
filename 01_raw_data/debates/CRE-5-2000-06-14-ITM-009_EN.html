<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Westendorp y Cabeza (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 17 May I asked an oral question to the Council and the Commission on behalf of the Committee which I chair, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy before the – I would say welcome – signing of an agreement between the European Union and China on the membership of the latter of the World Trade Organisation. In this regard, I would like to make a comment and two requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on behalf of the Committee which I chair, I would like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Lamy for his patience, perseverance and the skilful contacts he has been holding constantly not only with the Chinese authorities, but also with other important members of the Council of the WTO, in particular the United States, which have allowed both the Congress of the United States and the European Union to reach a preliminary agreement on the membership of China, the importance of which is obvious because it will incorporate into the World Trade Organisation more than a billion people, with all the challenges and possibly positive responses that this will involve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this agreement is positive because it brings with it economic, social, environmental and also geopolitical advantages for China and the world in general, especially the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What seems particularly positive to us is the opening up achieved in the field of financial services, telecommunications and insurance, which will offer opportunities, with no doubt whatsoever, to our economic operators, and also the gradual opening up of the energy markets in China which, apart from certain economic benefits, will lead to greater compliance with environmental standards in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Another additional advantage is that China, through its entry into the World Trade Organisation, will be subject to its rules. This is positive in itself and will bring China into a new and different dynamic in terms of closer relations with the rest of the world, although this must not cause us to stop being vigilant with regard to the respect for human rights, social rights and environmental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would like to say that there will be difficulties, since the position of the Commission and the Council, which Parliament supports, requires fundamental respect for basic social and environmental rights, China’s acceptance of which, paradoxically, will be more difficult to ensure once China is a member of the World Trade Organisation with full rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we also fully support the Commission and Council initiative to relaunch the round, which was frustrated at the outset in Seattle, as soon as possible, turning it into a global round.</p>
<p class="contents">Those have been my comments. My two questions are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are very interested to know whether the Commission is willing to work closely with the United States on this package of financial assistance, which is so important and necessary, so that China may be provided with the administrative and legal apparatus for it to fulfil its obligations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question is as follows: we have worked very well with the Commission and the Council throughout this process and we intend to continue to do so. I believe that this cooperation gives legitimacy to a process which is being criticised. The question is clear. More than a question, it is a request: at the end of the process, will the agreement with China be subject to the approval of Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this hypothesis does not put the Council or the Commission at any risk, since its success is guaranteed. As I have said, Parliament supports this agreement. Furthermore, we will all gain in terms of democratic legitimacy with this important agreement, since, I do not need to stress, it is laid down that in important agreements Parliament has a decisive role to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (PT)</span> Mr President, the conclusion on 19 May of the bilateral agreement on access to the market in goods and services between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China constituted, as we must all recognise, an important step in the process of China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation which, incidentally, has now been operating for 14 years. The integration of a partner with the economic and political size of China into the multilateral trade system will undoubtedly form one of the most important factors in the world economy at the beginning of this new century. Mr Westendorp y Cabeza mentioned the size of the Chinese population and market and the importance which this will have in terms of the internal balance of the WTO. The universal vocation of the WTO will therefore be reinforced and the discussions on the ways of making its operation more effective will from now on be an absolutely essential exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">At the level of the WTO, the bilateral negotiations now occurring are just one step towards the multilateralisation of the agreed mechanisms and towards the finalisation of the process in Geneva. This requires the group’s work towards accession to be continued in terms of the final wording of the respective protocol. Only at the end of this process will China’s accession be placed on the agenda of a General Council meeting for approval by the WTO members, assuming that these have, in the meantime, carried out the internal procedures required for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">At Community level, this issue must still be discussed by the Member States as the process usually followed and known as the ad hoc Ecuador process is proving to be too tacit and, as such, is incompatible with the political and economic weight of China and with the specific importance of this particular case. The European Union will have to give its clear and explicit assent to China’s accession to the WTO and the Council must decide on the overall accession package which must also be submitted to Parliament for an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not answer the second question posed by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza as this has been overtaken by events. It concerned the mandate conferred on the Commission and whether this was broad enough. The evidence shows that the mandate was broad enough, even too broad for some countries, including mine, which had certain concerns about establishing this mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">As for cooperation and technical assistance actions, we have seen that, despite the problems noted throughout this negotiating process, China has proven its commitment to the multilateral process and has even prioritised this in certain regional choices. It must now, during this stage, make an additional effort to apply the commitments it has made and to demonstrate the necessary willingness to comply with its multilateral obligations and to respect the rules and instructions of the World Trade Organisation. It is therefore of the greatest importance that the Chinese authorities carry out the necessary adaptations internally. For this reason the European Union is already prepared to provide nearly EUR 22 million for actions aimed at certain areas which may initially be more difficult to address due to the particular nature of Chinese legislation. These actions include the issues of government acquisitions and intellectual property. The developed countries must cooperate closely so that, through technical assistance measures, China can satisfactorily meet the terms agreed for its accession to the WTO. This is a fact which these countries have recognised, as was proven at the summit between the United States of America and the European Union on 31 May when this issue was addressed. China’s accession will constitute a stability factor in the world economy and will give increased importance to the next round of WTO negotiations which we hope can start as soon as possible. For this reason we must all make an effort to ensure that this objective is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hoped that the accession process can be completed quickly through firm commitments which are compatible with the level of development already achieved by certain sectors of the Chinese economy. This will ensure that the stability of the markets will not be threatened. However, in addition to this aspect, China’s accession to the WTO will also have effects at political level, given that the requirements for internal reforms and greater transparency, and consequently greater exposure to external public opinion, will have an impact on the actions of the Chinese authorities in areas other than the strictly commercial area. However, the next speaker will probably know more about this than I do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly endorsing a couple of the remarks made by the honourable Member, Mr Westendorp – which, I am sure, is always a sensible way of beginning a speech in a debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I should like to endorse in the most glowing terms possible the encomium that he delivered to my colleague, Commissioner Lamy, for the way he conducted these negotiations. I have had some experience of negotiating with China myself and I have to say that I am lost in admiration for Commissioner Lamy's achievement. I should like, as he did with characteristic generosity, to say that all of us should also pay tribute to his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who helped to get these negotiations up and running, even though they had to travel several more laps than he thought likely at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I entirely agree with what the honourable Member said about the importance of the outcome of these negotiations. This agreement is very good for China and Europe; it is good for the Asian region and for the world and, as we saw, it almost certainly had a beneficial effect on the vote in the US Congress. It is good news all round. It will be a challenge for China and, in due course, for the WTO. However, it has always seemed to me that it is something of a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which has not contained the representatives of between a fifth and a quarter of humanity. This is a good news story.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to deal with the two questions which the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has raised. First, the question about Parliament's assent. Commissioner Lamy has already had an opportunity to set out in the plenary of this House in March the view of the Commission that China's WTO accession is a trade agreement of major importance and, therefore, that it is exactly the type of agreement that would be submitted for Parliament's assent, were the Commission proposals for the IGC to be accepted. However, at this stage these are just proposals. We obviously cannot anticipate the results of the IGC, so we have to stick to current Treaty rules. As Parliament knows, the China agreement does not fit any of the categories of Article 300(3) that would justify submission for assent. The agreement will, however, in principle, be submitted for consultation, so the European Parliament will have ample opportunity to express its views on the agreement. Of course, it is the Council that decides on consultation with the European Parliament. This is as far as the legal and the institutional answer goes.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more political and pragmatic level, I can assure the House that the Commission will work with the European Parliament to ensure that it can make its voice heard. The House will know that, in exemplary fashion, Commissioner Lamy has held several rounds of discussions with Members of this Parliament during the final phases of the negotiations with China. I know that he debriefed Members right after the agreement was initialled: he phoned the honourable Member to inform him that he had finalised the agreement. I can assure the House that he intends to continue this dialogue throughout the internal approval procedures of the European Union. It is an indication of that old truth that being more transparent invariably means being more successful.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I should like to add, however, that on 19 May we only concluded – a point made by the presidency – our bilateral agreement with China on her terms of accession to the WTO. The multilateral phase of China's accession that takes place in Geneva has still to be finalised. This is not expected to happen before the end of September at the earliest. In other words, whatever procedures will apply within the European Union regarding China's WTO accession, the issue is really only relevant after the multilateral phase has been concluded, because the approval procedures will start only after this date.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I want to come to the extremely important point which the honourable Member raised about technical assistance to help China to implement its WTO obligations. We have in the Commission five cooperation programmes in China, which total EUR 25 million. They are either in place or will be implemented soon. They include a framework programme which aims to strengthen the relevant Chinese administrative structures and capacities through a series of specialised modules targeting segments in the Chinese administration which will be dealing with WTO implementation. Other programmes are geared towards helping China to implement specific WTO obligations. We are currently considering how best to build on these, and new initiatives will be taken. China's WTO accession and the related considerable needs for technical assistance are likely to generate significant interest from other donors, including the United States and Japan, but also from our own Member States and from the WTO secretariat. Clearly, close coordination is going to be essential in order to avoid overlaps and to develop synergies between different programmes which each donor will implement in accordance with its own procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for coordination will be especially strong where assistance is targeted at the implementation of specific WTO agreements, and we will support close involvement of the WTO in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of coordination with the United States, we will certainly look very carefully at our options. We have to bear in mind that this will have some effects on the visibility of our European efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The first exploratory talks on China's technical assistance needs and the respective roles and intentions of various donors will take place shortly through direct contacts in Peking and on the fringe of the WTO working party on the accession of China next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to repeat that this is an extremely important issue; it is an issue on which Commissioner Lamy and I have already begun discussions. We want to keep Parliament fully informed about our plans, but I am absolutely certain that, having made this extremely important breakthrough, it is now very important to give as much technical help as possible to ensure that it has the results in China and, therefore, for the rest of the region and the world that all of us hope for and would like to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission represented coherent positions on the part of the European Union with the support of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and implemented many of them. Competition and the reciprocal opening of markets, freedom of establishment and in the provision of services, intellectual property rights, environmental protection and partnership for sustainable development are just a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, our position is based on the principles of free and fair global trade and is shaped by the European model of a social, ecological market economy, many fundamental points of which are already included in European framework legislation. We expressly thank Commissioner Lamy and his team – and I expressly include his predecessor Sir Leon Brittan here – for the excellent result; the Commission negotiated successfully and competently; China has moved a long way towards opening its markets and basically accepts the rules specified by the World Trade Organisation in 1994 and further developed since. There is no need to outline the specific successes in detail. They range from reductions in customs tariffs, from starting rates of often over 40% to an average of 10%, to the opening of import and export monopolies via joint ventures in the service sector, trade chains and medium-term freedom of establishment for independent European undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">So the results are clear. But integrating China into world trade also means ensuring that it is in a position to respect and apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation, act as a responsible partner and take on new responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore thank Commissioner Patten for his assurance that technical assistance, training for China’s specialists and for those responsible for the new chapter in cooperation will be coordinated with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">But we feel that something else is needed; greater understanding on China’s part of the European Union’s commercial position on the reciprocal opening of the markets. We are counting on China’s supporting the European Union’s proposals for a comprehensive new round of WTO talks in the short term. In the long term, we would stress the implications of a more intensive trading partnership with China for peace in Asia, Europe and the world as a whole. We feel that China will, in the long term, see the obvious need for the rapid economic and social development of China to be fostered within a framework of open markets and democratic reform. On behalf of the PPE Group, therefore, I welcome the successful outcome of negotiations with China and call on the Council to put this result in political order so that the European Parliament is able to adopt this important decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow members have already picked up on the main points. Permit me, therefore, to address just a few aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has achieved a number of successes, mainly thanks to Commissioner Lamy, who really has achieved some resounding successes. But this also applies of course to the United States, and the same will apply to the other countries due to enter into negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, one important point will be not just be to help China integrate into the world economy – it has already more or less done that – but also to help this country take a further step towards the general democratisation of its society. We have been able to follow what is at stake in all the discussions, in the leading world press and in the lively debate between economists on the matter, but the crucial question is: what will actually happen once China becomes a member of the WTO? Will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society? Will it mark the beginning of a new round in politics? Will it result in institutional reforms in China? And, of course, will there also be a further opening of the market? These are the really crucial and exciting questions which we face. I am sure that it is in the minds of all the honourable members who have spoken and I believe that it is my group’s opinion, that we should use this opening and the integration of China into the World Trade Organisation to help it make a quantum leap.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not fool ourselves, we must not harbour any illusions, and we must insist that the WTO rules are in fact upheld, because this is, of course, the crux of the matter. This is where we really will have to get down to brass tacks during further discussions with the Commission. Because the package negotiated is extremely comprehensive and includes highly critical and sensitive sectors. Critical voices are already being heard on the part of industry to the effect that success is all well and good, but ex-post control of implementation is equally important. I think that we will be able to count on good collaboration here, so that this form of implementation can be monitored by Parliament and Parliament can be kept abreast of current developments.</p>
<p class="contents">One further point which I should like to address, and which I think is highly important, is our hope that with the opening of the market and with the further opening of society in China, greater respect will be given to human rights. Human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society. I think that this a point which we cannot allow to be sidelined, even in talks, even if they do not form a substantial part of purely economic negotiations. I think that you have always set particular store by this. Nonetheless, it is important that this point be reiterated constantly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have two short minutes in which to make four points. Firstly I would like to join in the warm congratulations to Commissioner Lamy and indeed his distinguished predecessor Sir Leon, now Lord, Brittan. I hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a point addressed to the Council. The Council's attitude towards parliamentary assent to a deal like this is linked to the Council's parallel attitude towards the Commission's proposal for its extension of its own powers over areas such as intellectual property and services in Article 133 more generally. I have to confess I get the impression that there is a certain degree of institutional territoriality here, particularly in the large Member States, where the trade and industry ministries are very reluctant to see the Commission continue to extend its scope in those new areas in WTO trade negotiations and, consistent with that, also reluctant to see the European Parliament increase its influence. This simply cannot carry on. It is such a weird anachronism that a policy that was communautarised back in the 1950s is as unaccountable and non-transparent as it is. I would plead for the internal territorial interests of Member States to be overcome on this particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, technical assistance. It is great that we are going to coordinate with the Americans, but look at the numbers: EUR 25 million is absolutely nothing in comparison to the challenge we face! We have a total budget for China of EUR 80 million. Even if we allocate all of that to China-WTO accession it would still not be enough. We – the Commission, Council and Parliament – have to be a lot more ambitious in actually allocating much more money towards this enormous task.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, human rights. I hope the fact that we have signed up to this bilateral deal with the Chinese does not leave them thinking that we are going to be any more forgiving on human rights. It is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the Chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights. Let us not give them the impression that a deal on the WTO means that we are going to be weak on human rights – it should be the reverse. We should be all the more robust.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Chinese, in particular, are heading there and nowhere else. </p>
<p class="contents">I was reading an interview in <span class="italic">China Labour Bulletin</span> the other day about one of the tens of millions of Chinese who have become unemployed because of the famous ‘opening up’ of their country. This person was complaining about the unemployment, insecurity and enormous widening of the gulf between the classes. In fact, this Chinese person was so desperate that she said she wished Mao Tse Tung was back.</p>
<p class="contents">From all the analyses I have read, which is quite a lot (both Chinese and Western, liberal and socialist), it is apparent that unemployment is coming to China. It has already increased a great deal and, through accession to the WTO, it is going to increase a very great deal more. </p>
<p class="contents">I am wondering now if the Commission has carried out any other analyses. I wonder if the Commission has any serious scientific analyses indicating that unemployment in China, contrary to what is apparent from all these other analyses, is going to decline rapidly and that social stability is going to be strengthened instead of the gulf between social classes widening further. It would be extremely interesting to know. </p>
<p class="contents">Another matter is that of human rights. A number of people here believe that human rights should benefit from China’s accession to the WTO. Yes, that is possible – I am no fortune-teller. Parliament did, however, give the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jingsheng, who has a quite different view of this issue. His assessment is that the WTO Agreement will not benefit human rights at all. He has actively fought against it because he thinks that it does not make reasonable demands where human rights are concerned. It would be extremely interesting to know what are the Commission’s and the Council’s analyses of this question. In what way is Wei Jingsheng mistaken? We should like to know that we are not doing anything which, contrary to our intentions, is unfavourable to human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not, however, my fault, Commissioner, if there is a wishy-washy consensus in this Parliament. Nor must you count on my weariness to stop me hammering out evidence which, although on the face of it appears dogmatic, should be blatantly obvious to everyone: The WTO is a machine that should by switched off before it goes any further, instead of carrying on as if there were no problem apart from the stunning failure that was Seattle. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, what has happened since that abortive summit? New negotiations have started in Geneva, in a fug that is not dispelled straightaway by Mr Lamy’s praiseworthy speeches to this Parliament, and the European Union, hot on the heels of the United States, is negotiating the future conditions for China’s accession. Therefore, we have the right to ask a few questions. </p>
<p class="contents">What purpose do the WTO meetings serve if there is no difference between failure and success in the way internal business is conducted? What credibility can institutional reforms have, given that they are supposed to respond to major investigations, if, even before they are implemented, the path to imminent membership is open to a country which alone comprises one fifth of the world’s population? Furthermore, are you able to tell us how the European Union and its partners categorise China? Do you class it as a developing country or as something else? How do you see the astonishing upheaval in the balance within the organisation that uses this kind of approach to the situation? Finally, can you tell us what – if anything – the European Union is getting from the United States, as, according to statements by Mr Lamy, the negotiations undertaken with the Chinese have been based on what the Americans had already obtained, with increased benefit for the Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the quality of Mr Lamy’s work is not, of course, the issue here but, in spite of my repeated requests to see a proper assessment of the WTO carried out, these negotiations are going ahead without such an assessment having been made. I must say that it looks like we would not be able to undertake any action that might give the impression that doubts exist as to the benefits of liberalising world trade. I regret the fact that there was such little consultation with the Union’s Member States and the European Parliament which are, in the main, supporters not of the fine cause that is the World Trade Organisation, of which we too are part, but of that of the frantic development of global free-trade, to the detriment of our people’s essential interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not feel, however, that he was very clear on the political benefits. Whatever the case, I personally can very clearly see who will reap the political benefit, and that is the Chinese regime. When I say the Chinese regime, I do not mean the institutions, but a despotic regime. </p>
<p class="contents">Some might, of course, agree with Mr Westendorp y Cabeza. In signing this agreement, we have certainly not dropped our guard where human rights are concerned, because we cannot do so. Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, we have obtained nothing from the People’s Republic of China. In terms of improving the rule of law, in terms of strengthening democracy or in terms of respect for human rights, we have made no progress in ten years, none at all! Every day, we see and read the same news: further arrests of dissidents, further arrests of members of the Democratic Party and the continued colonisation of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, by the way, the World Bank is preparing to double the resources for a huge project that we support, since our States are the main members of that venerable institution. Over the next few weeks, then, the World Bank will double the ability of Chinese emigrants to colonise Tibet a little more. That is what is on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Members who have spoken about human rights are well aware, as we all are, particularly having heard Commissioner Brittan over the last few years, that there has never been any question of linking human rights and democracy to the WTO agreements. We are therefore aware that we are strengthening a despotic regime, a regime that is stockpiling weapons, and which is gaining strength in that part of the world. We have resigned ourselves to this fact, not thinking that in twenty years’ time this regime may bring to bear on us too the pressures that it may shortly bring to bear on the whole of Asia. We have resigned ourselves to the fact that we are abandoning the Chinese people and the idea of democracy for the Chinese people and, ultimately, for all of us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After such a long history of negotiations clearly all that was needed was the question from our committee to push the matter to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently I was visiting Taiwan where people clearly hope that the accession of China to the WTO will lead to improved cross-strait relations, and we must welcome that. I would have referred to Commissioner Patten knowing well the difficulties of dealing and negotiating with China, but he has already mentioned that.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of a change in the duty on spirits from 65% to 10% will be a most welcome one in certain parts of the whisky-producing areas of the UK. I look forward to sharing that news with them in liberal and liquid fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">On a larger scale the position achieved in access to, and faster opening up of, the telecoms market is also good news. China has such huge potential in this market for growth, and European operators have a great opportunity as world leaders looking for new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this step in the further integration of China into the world economy but we must recall the emphasis that we, in the European Union, place upon other values in addition to trade. In that context I would like to call, on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues, for European Parliament participation in the half-yearly dialogue on human rights. If this Parliament were part of that dialogue we might exert additional pressure for improvement in that field. I hope the Commissioner will listen carefully to that suggestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, while international big business is busy popping champagne corks in celebration of the agreement on China's proposed accession to the WTO, China's small-scale farmers are already quaking in their shoes. They know that accession to the WTO will be a very mixed blessing for China and that for them, as small farmers, it could spell ruin. So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten. There are many people in China for whom this agreement does not spell good news.</p>
<p class="contents">Powerful international agri-business knows that too. That is why US grain companies like Cargill cannot believe their luck. They have just been handed the biggest market in the world and can expect US farm exports to increase by USD 2 billion over the next five years as Chinese tariff cuts begin to take effect. No wonder they are already gloating over bigger, better and more consistent markets.</p>
<p class="contents">But while Cargill is so delighted that its profits will rise while Chinese self-sufficiency in agricultural goods falls, the picture is a good deal less optimistic for the people of China themselves. It has been estimated that increased competition from cheap agricultural imports could mean that about 400 million rural Chinese will no longer be needed on farms by 2005. It is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is offering technical support to the Chinese in order to help them with the enormous economic restructuring which accession to the WTO will bring. What I would like to see is an equal concern to help with the almost inconceivable social restructuring which will inevitably follow in its wake with – I repeat – 400 million rural farmers out of a job.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy has been quoted as saying that the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China yielded 96% of what the EU was demanding. Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the giant leaps forward, many problems remain unresolved and questions left open with regard to world trade. One of the biggest and politically most difficult of these has been China’s accession to the WTO, and this same problem will again be associated with the implementation of the agreement in practice. As this is a matter of the world’s second largest economy and eleventh largest exporting country joining the most important institutional system for world trade, the importance of the issue cannot be emphasised too heavily. I agree with Mr Clegg as regards the impression one gets that the Commission and the Council have perhaps been rather too keen in this matter to refer to the Treaty of Amsterdam and hide behind formal requirements. I am, however, very satisfied that the Commission is in agreement with us that talks with China concerning its membership of the WTO are a matter that Parliament cannot pass over and that we will have this issue heard in this Chamber. The fact that the talks on accession will not lead to changing the legal framework does not lessen the importance of the issue. For that reason, an informal dialogue free from the exact wording of the basic agreement, which the Commissioner mentioned in his speech, is more crucial than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interests of the European Union as a whole to support China in the reform of its economy, administration and legal system. It is sensible to implement the technical assistance package from the EU and the United States in a context of collaboration; this is necessary to guarantee the speedy and single-minded implementation of the reforms. Of the reforms in the public sector, that concerning state-owned companies is vital for continued economic growth in China. In this connection I will make my sole comment regarding content: the percentage of ownership by foreign companies was not fixed at the level the EU was aiming at. That was a very bad mistake. Another important political question is how the economic life of the country is to be reformed, as that is closely linked with the fate of China’s socialist system as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I came for this debate at 3 o'clock I was told it would be taking place later, towards 5 o'clock. Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today's agenda, namely, the debate previewed for the late payments directive – the report of the conciliation procedure with the Council. This is an issue which is now entirely without contention. Everybody supports this matter. The rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and the chairman of the committee would all support a suggestion that this be turned into a vote without debate. That would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening. Possibly we could have a vote on it now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
