<p class="contents">Since its first summit six years ago, ASEM has been characterised by ever broader and more fruitful cooperation in a range of areas of common interest to Europe and Asia. More than 40 initiatives have been launched in areas as diverse as money laundering, illegal migration, people smuggling, child welfare, human rights, environmental protection, educational exchanges, lifelong learning and international cooperation. The number of meetings has also increased. In between the summits, ASEM’s foreign ministers and ministers of finance and economic affairs meet annually, for example, partly for the purpose of improving the summits and making efforts to ensure that the best possible results are achieved through the ASEM process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more than two billion people living in the ASEM countries. Together, they produce more than half of what is produced throughout the world. The Asian ASEM countries form the EU’s second largest trading partner. This state of affairs illustrates the considerable significance of ASEM and the importance of the two regions’ continuing to cooperate fruitfully and in promising ways. A successful summit at the end of this month is therefore a high priority for the Danish EU Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with the three previous ASEM summits, ASEM 4 will be divided into three work sessions, one for each of the main areas of cooperation. These are: 1) political dialogue, 2) economic cooperation and 3) social, cultural and educational issues. Moreover, the forthcoming summit will include, as an innovation, an informal breakfast debate under the heading, ‘Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations’.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is that the political dialogue should be based on the new international situation following 11 September, and it will involve a debate on the new challenges we face in terms of security policy. That means, for example, organised cross-border crime that affects us all. It is first and foremost a question of how, in the context of ASEM cooperation, we can unite in combating international terrorism, as well as other transnational threats such as the drugs trade, money laundering and illegal migration. A broad approach is required in this connection, with the emphasis on combating the underlying factors that can form a seedbed for extremism and intolerance. Among the matters to which we must attach importance are the fight against poverty and better access to education. With a view to translating words into action, the expectation is that the discussions will result in the adoption of a declaration on cooperation between Europe and Asia on the combating of international terrorism, combined with a cooperation programme based on existing ASEM activities for combating cross-border crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The political dialogue traditionally involves an exchange of opinions about development in the two regions. The subjects will undoubtedly include the most recent developments in the Korean Peninsula, and a declaration concerning the Korean Peninsula is expected to be issued at ASEM 4 with a view to promoting reconciliation and cooperation. Other subjects might include EU enlargement and the development of cooperation under ASEAN+3.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussion of economic matters will concentrate on economic and financial priorities in the light of the global economic recession, the consequences of the recession for the two regions and the opportunities for cooperating with a view to rectifying the situation. The current efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation may, for example, be continued by working towards the implementation of the objectives formulated in the two ASEM economic action programmes, the Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the Investment Promotion Action Plan (IPAP). Economic, financial and monetary integration as a growth factor is also expected to be discussed at the summit, as is the WTO Development Round as an essential prerequisite of sustainable economic development. It will be natural to use the ASEM process to add momentum to the Doha Development Round. In light of the results achieved in the Doha Round, there will be the possibility of strengthened regional cooperation with a view to achieving further progress in the economic relations between the EU and the Asian ASEM partners.</p>
<p class="contents">ASEM’s efforts to break down barriers to trade and investment are based on proposals from high-ranking private sector business leaders via the Asia-Europe Business Forum (AEBF) whose tasks include that of helping improve trade relations between Asia and Europe. This organisation’s annual forum will take place – under my own chairmanship, incidentally – directly before the ASEM 4 summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third main area – that of social, cultural and educational issues – the general theme will be that of measures for combating the unintended consequences of globalisation. The importance of developing human resources, including educational cooperation and lifelong learning, is expected to be given a central place in this context. One objective is to ensure that economic growth is reflected in progress in the social sphere that will go on to form the basis for social stability. A seminar on the subject is intended as the first step on the way. The discussions during the third work session will also relate to environmental issues and include a discussion of the ASEM partners’ opportunities for consolidating and developing cooperation in the environmental sphere, partly in the light of the Johannesburg summit.</p>
<p class="contents">ASEM brings together a broad range of different civilisations and cultures across geographical, ethnic, religious and socio-economic boundaries and, in that way, the ASEM process helps create trust between the regions. By, as it were, building bridges between the European and Asian cultures and civilisations, ASEM is a forum well suited to the dialogue that is necessary in the fight against international terrorism’s attempts to split the international community. That is the background to the fact that the informal breakfast discussion I mentioned, under the heading ‘Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations’, is to be arranged at ASEM 4 with the purpose of promoting mutual understanding between Europe and Asia. The subjects might well be the significance of education in the efforts to promote understanding of other cultures and civilisations, the importance of equal access to information and significance of closer contacts between the nations of Europe and Asia. The expectation is that this special discussion will form the basis for an ongoing dialogue within ASEM concerning cultures and civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted with great interest the observations and recommendations by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, contained in the European Parliament’s report of 16 July 2002 on the Commission Communication on a Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships between Europe and Asia. I would point out in this connection that, with the forthcoming summit, we in the Council view ASEM-based cooperation between Europe and Asia as having advanced a stage further so that it now forms a better basis for meeting the common challenges we face. I hope we can achieve the objectives, with which I am in agreement and which are to be found in Parliament’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who was present here in Parliament at the start of European cooperation – I was chairman of the Japan delegation – I am impressed by what it has grown into. I should like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown and also draw attention to the personal contacts that exist between members of the European Parliament and the Asian parliaments. The importance of these cannot be overestimated, and the Presidency therefore attaches importance to Parliament’s report on ASEM cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, today's debate is extremely timely. The report is excellent. I know that honourable Members will understand when I say that this subject is one of particular interest to me. The debate takes place one year after the Commission’s 'Asia Strategy' was published in 2001 and one week from the first anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington. And finally, as has been said, it takes place not long before the fourth ASEM Summit brings together 26 European and Asian leaders in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">These points will be the main focus of my short presentation today, so let me deal with them in the same order.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the 'Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships' of 4 September 2001 followed our first substantial paper of 1994, called a 'New Asia Strategy', acknowledging that the new relationship between Asia and Europe had evolved beyond 'Aid and Trade'. The strategy paper of 2001 therefore reflects the importance that European Union-Asia political dialogue has gained.</p>
<p class="contents">The unprecedented speed of globalisation has also affected developments in both regions. We suggest moving towards an equal partnership with Asia, based on four key points. Firstly, recognition of the great cultural, political and geographical diversity within Asia. Secondly, strengthening the European Union's political and economic presence across the region. Thirdly, achieving better balance between the economic, political, social and cultural elements in our strategy. Fourthly, recognising that Asian countries are crucial political partners for the European Union – a point which we are discovering in the present talks on international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware of Parliament's concerns for the protection of human rights and the spreading of democracy, good governance and the rule of law in Asia and elsewhere. That is why constructive engagement, such as our human rights dialogue with China, is so important to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share Parliament’s concerns about continuing tensions across the Taiwan Strait and take full note of Parliament’s views on our relationship with Taiwan. While the European Union’s 'One China' policy precludes formal relations with Taiwan, we have to recognise that Taiwan is an important economic partner for the European Union – it is our third largest partner in the Asia/Pacific region. We will therefore maintain and where necessary intensify our dialogue with the Taiwanese administration in the economic and other fields. The Commission, as Parliament will know, also intends to open an office in Taipei very soon, probably around the end of the year. Moreover, we support Taiwanese participation in international organisations and processes, insofar as this is compatible with Taiwan’s status.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, both Council and Parliament have discussed and commented on the strategy after the appalling events of 11 September, which have since had a significant impact on policies and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The most obvious influence is in our policy towards Afghanistan, which we have just been able to debate at some length in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now only a few days away from ASEM 4 in Copenhagen. Apart from the regular ASEM meetings of foreign and finance ministers, which will be complemented soon by an economic ministers' meeting in Denmark, we have had different ministerial meetings on the environment and on managing migration. These meetings resulted in various concrete initiatives which will be endorsed by leaders at the Summit itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The minister referred to the main topics which will be discussed at the Summit. I hope it follows the lead given by foreign ministers, which makes the discussion on these occasions rather less formal and hidebound.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major advantages of ASEM is that it provides an opportunity to engage leaders from various cultures and civilisations as well as from countries at different stages of development, in order to draw strength from unity in diversity. And, as has been said, the leaders will for the first time be discussing the dialogue among cultures and civilisations in a retreat session.</p>
<p class="contents">Asia – this is my greatest recent understatement – is an extremely large region and therefore we are not advocating a 'one-size-fits-all policy'. In our latest policy paper, we have divided Asia into four sub-regions – the South, the South-East, North-East Asia and Australia/Oceania. Specific policy actions will be taken in the common framework.</p>
<p class="contents">So Asia is an extremely important topic for the Commission. There are three basic components to our approach. One of them concerns the definition of Asia as such, since geographic, cultural, political and other concepts are differently defined. Then there is the issue of coverage by our 'Asia Strategy', which has been the subject of some debate since its publication last year. Finally, there is the evolving discussion about the enlargement of the ASEM partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">On this last point, Members may recall that the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework 2000 introduced the two-key consensus principle. It means that a decision on new participants will be made by a consensus of all partners, only after a candidate has got the support of its own region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware that many Members have expressed a desire to enlarge ASEM to other partners in Asia. We have already agreed at the level of ASEM foreign ministers that the consolidation of ASEM and the question of enlargement will come up at the next Summit to be held in Hanoi in 2004. This was a wise decision: we will have to use the time until the next Summit not only to prepare ASEM for more participants, but also to prepare the agenda of that meeting very carefully. Selecting issues where there is an 'ASEM added value' is vital in order to avoid overlapping agendas. So it is important to define what should be dealt with bilaterally, regionally or multilaterally. In the regional context, we will have to ensure that ASEAN, ARF and ASEM deal with those issues which each forum is best placed to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">We will take full account of Parliament's suggestions during the preparations for the Hanoi Summit to which I have referred, and, I can assure the honourable Member that we will continue to pay the closest attention to this comprehensive report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by mentioning three points. We have demonstrated our growing concern about Asia by the changes we have made to our external services over the last year or so. Parliament will know that we can only open new delegations if we close or run down existing ones. Parliament is understandably very firm on the ceiling that we have for the number of delegations around the world. Parliament will also know that, on the whole, you receive more flack for closing or running down an office than praise for establishing one. Despite the political problems that we face, we will over the next few months be able to point to the opening of new delegations in Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal and to the opening of an office in Taiwan. Parliament will know that in an environment where these things cannot be achieved at lightening pace that is a pretty good achievement and an indication of the priority that we are giving Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I remain absolutely convinced that a region to which we have not given sufficient attention and where we have not made our policies sufficiently coherent is South-East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Before 1997 European businesses, banks and other interests, often perhaps overwhelmed by stories of Asian economic miracles, piled into South-East Asia with exaggerated optimism. The problem since 1997 is that all too many of them have exited from South-East Asia and have not been realistic about what is still being, and can be, achieved there. I am very keen that we should develop a more coherent European policy on South-East Asia and give it higher priority. Next year the Commission will be coming forward with a communication which will seek to put our trade, commercial, environmental, economic and political relationships with South-East Asia in a sensible context. For example the importance of Indonesia in our political and economic lives has to be underlined in the establishment of a clearer and more coherent policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that an area where we have manifested an ability to be a supportive but not an insignificant player is the Korean Peninsula. I believe very strongly that the policy being pursued by President Kim Dae-Jung is entirely right. It is very important for us to play a supportive role – perhaps not as important as the role others such as the United States, China and Japan are playing – but nevertheless an important role in reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula and in encouraging North Korea to join the rest of the human race. We should continue to build on the foundations which have been laid in that area. It is just an indication of how, without any <span class="italic">amour propre</span> and without exaggerating what we can achieve, if we just focus on some of the areas where we have real strengths to bring to bear, we can actually make much more of a reality of our Asia policy, and that we intend to do.</p>

The Commission's document, its view of EU-Asia relations, which is the topic of my report, is clear, coherent and shows understanding for the situation Asia is facing, and there is a desperate need for this. One of the flaws in the Europe-Asia relations is, in my view, the Council's minimalist approach to date, particularly by Foreign Affairs Ministers. An all-time low was, to my mind, our Ministers' paper-thin contribution to ASEM III in Seoul, which was in sharp contrast to the Commission's contribution over there. This is no longer acceptable. Anyone who has worked on this over the past year knows that firm and concrete steps need to be taken, for this is what Asia and Europe's challenges require. Steps that go beyond strong, economic cooperation – of which, I, incidentally, am greatly in favour – and that go beyond window dressing and the endless symbolism that is meant to be taken as policy. I am therefore pleased with the Commissioner's announcement that a South—East Asia strategy will be adopted soon, for that is indeed the missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p class="contents">I can easily illustrate the challenge we are facing in the area of human rights by quoting an example from everyday life. In October last year, I reported in this Parliament on the case of Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam. Following a lengthy stay abroad, Mr Trinh had made investments in his own country. He was subsequently detained under false pretences and his possessions were seized. This was a tragic event for him and his family, but, above all, sent a very negative signal to possible investors in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now a year on. Some progress has been made, but not anything like enough. Mr Trinh's possessions have still not been returned to him and those who falsely accused him have still not been brought to justice. The European Union is currently Vietnam's key donor, but a parallel focus on respecting human rights is lacking. This makes the policy incoherent and certainly lacking in one of the areas in which Europe always prides itself. Not without reason did the UN human rights committee recently report on a large number of human rights abuses in Vietnam. Other Asian countries, including Cambodia or North Korea, did not escape the UN committee's condemnation either. It would be impossible to list them all one by one, but I hope that the message is clear. The observation of human rights, including, for example, the protection of investors, cannot be seen in isolation from economic cooperation. They are both interdependent.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only does the European Union consider itself to be the guardian of human rights, but also the supporter of democratisation processes and young democracies across the world. Across the world? Not quite, for surprisingly, there is a young democracy in Asia which should not count on any support, namely Taiwan. The way in which Europe and our Council treat this country is hypocritical. This is the only way I can describe it. Taiwan is a budding democracy with which we maintain sound economic ties. To give you an example: last year, President Chen Shui-bian was unable to receive his Liberal International Prize for Freedom, because he was refused a visa, whilst representatives of the People's Republic of China had a great time travelling across the entire Continent. We are all acquainted with the democratic content of the regime in Beijing. I can totally understand that Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe are refused visas, but surely it is very bizarre to bar an elected leader from a democratic country, who is on a private visit. Not one Member State wanted to grant the liberal-democratic guest a visa, and the Council showed its weakest side by not lifting a finger. I therefore warmly welcome the Commission's plans to open an office in Taipei. In fact, I do this for other Asian countries too. Commissioner, you asked for credit, well, here it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the harsh words I have spoken about the Council, I should like to say to my good friend, Mr Haarder, that I was pleased with his comments about the preparations of ASEM IV. His words inspire confidence. A comprehensive and serious approach to ASEM IV was needed, and I hope that he will receive actual support within the Council for this. Economic cooperation – investments by SMEs spring to mind, but also political dialogue and exchanges – the Minister has quoted the entire list – are of major importance.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, it is not as if we were still living in the Rudyard Kipling's era, who observed: east is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet. Democratic rule of law is central in Asia too. There is no Asian model, or, in fact, a European model. This is why I should like to finish off by reminding you of the words of a famous Asia expert, which he wrote some four years ago in his book on China and Hong Kong. He said “it is absurd to argue for the existence of any fundamental difference between the personal standards and moral principles of Asians on the one hand and Europeans and Americans on the other, for decency is decency, East and West”. These are wise words, Commissioner Patten, that have not lost any of their truth.</p>

I think it is a great thing that both sides of the straits are following our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I speak on behalf of the PPE Group when I make the observation that we very much welcome your statements on the preparations for the fourth ASEM process. I believe that your statements constitute impressive evidence of the careful and committed way in which both the Council and the Commission have prepared for the ASEM IV meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, however, calls for something about which I would ask you to say something in greater detail, namely, in view of the plethora of issues to be discussed, which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, for there to be definite action by the Heads of State and of Government, with firm timetables and defined objectives. It is not enough to do as we did at ASEM III and discuss all the problems we have in the world, taking in the economy, culture, politics and education, leaving the public to wonder after the event what actually came out of it all. Hence our preference, and our demand, for fewer but definite plans for closer cooperation between Asia and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to pick out from the abundance of issues that have been mentioned, just three on which I believe it important to us in Parliament that the Heads of State and of Government in Europe and Asia should bring forth definite results.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that a start be made on a special process of bringing the two cultural horizons together. It is precisely in view of the anniversary of the terrible events of 11 September that Europe and Asia, whatever their many historic, cultural and religious differences, must define, for the sake of our co-existence and peace in the world, what they have in common, what binds them together and draw conclusions from this. We expect this political and cultural dialogue to have a definite starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is one that Bertel Haarder, being a Dane, will well understand. As regards terrorism, there is one point on which we want something definite, namely the combating of terrorism at sea. Over and over again, our ships, when sailing between Asia und Europe, fall prey to pirates in certain narrow stretches of sea. We cannot explain to the public how it is that we are in a position to combat terrorism throughout the world, but apparently incapable of facing up to terrorists in narrow stretches of sea, terrorists who endanger our ships' crews and kill them!</p>
<p class="contents">The third is the problem of migration. In the President-in-Office of the Council, whose remit not only includes European policy but also immigration, we have a good partner, one who will see to it that definite decisions will actually be taken in the course of ASEM IV on how we can cooperate better in combating the illegal movement of people between Asia and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn briefly to Mr Maaten's report, which is of course an excellent one. Time compels me to highlight only five aspects of it, so please forgive me for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, you pointed out that the issue of enlarging ASEM's membership calls for a consensual approach, but you quite rightly understood that we in Parliament want to encourage you to talk with our Asian partners in ASEM IV in preparation for the Hanoi conference. What is at issue is the assertion that 'we will enlarge from 15 states to 20'. As Europeans, we consider it important that Asia should concentrate particularly on including such countries as India and Taiwan in the Asia process. You yourself pointed out the special role that India and Taiwan play. I believe that we should, so to speak, ‘push’ these countries in order to get them accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">You have already demonstrated political commitment to a dialogue on human rights, and on that you have our full support. I believe that the human rights dialogue with the People's Republic of China, which has just begun, has demonstrated that both sides will from now on be working on the basis of human rights being universal in character. Let there be an end to the appalling argument about whether there are Asian or European human rights – on the contrary, human rights are universal, and it is on that basis that the dialogue should be proceeded with.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe should also perhaps play more of a part in the prevention and resolution of conflict in Asia. The security of the region is of crucial importance for the world as a whole. That is why we should also give constructive support to the political dialogue between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on the basis of democracy, peoples’ right to self-determination, respect for human rights and for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be endeavouring to play some sort of role in reducing the tensions between India and Pakistan. This has to do not only with the protection of cultural minorities, but also with the protection of Christian minorities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very grateful to you, Commissioner Patten, for referring, in your capacity as the Commission's spokesman, to the prompt inauguration of the delegation to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal. That is something that Parliament has long desired. We need to have higher-profile representation in a continent comprising half of the world's population. On that you have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me to conclude on a note of mild criticism. Today finds us discussing the great importance of Asia and Europe, and the two continents' relationship with one another. I hope I am not off beam in saying that there will soon be, and also in September, a meeting, a summit between the European Union and China, which is scheduled to take one day. I wonder whether the Heads of State and of Government should not perhaps take longer than just one day to embark on a truly in-depth dialogue with the People's Republic of China. I think that would be appropriate in view of that country's significance and that of the continent.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I welcome the Commission's communication, 'Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships', and Mr Maaten's report, for which we congratulate him.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in the past too often neglected Asia and focused more on other regions of the world, but in fact it contains a majority of the world's population. We welcome the recognition, both in the report and the Commission statement, that we must engage with Asia, not only in trade and economics, but in other areas as well: cultural exchanges, for example, particularly between Europe and Asia's moderate Islamic states; justice and home affairs, in the war against terrorism, drugs traffic and organised crime, all self-evidently with a global dimension; environmental policy, where Europe and Asia face the same threat from pollution and environmental degradation; security policy, where, in an increasingly globalised world, a crisis on the Korean Peninsula – as Commissioner Patten mentioned – would threaten the peace and stability of the whole world. That is one reason why the European Union is engaged in the KEDO process.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the emergence of Asian voices speaking together through ASEAN and other regional fora. We also welcome and would like to encourage and deepen the widening of the ASEM process and its parallel parliamentary dialogue through ASEP. I had the opportunity to participate in the first ASEP meeting here in Strasbourg back in 1996 and in last week's second ASEP meeting in Manila, where we achieved a unanimity of views with statements on terrorism, the environment, on human rights for women and children. Here Members of the European Parliament from Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy joined with colleagues from China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines to agree that Kyoto needs to be ratified; the UN must be the basis of the global war against terrorism; positive action is required to address discrimination against women; we should work with trade unions and other representatives of civil society to combat child labour. The fundamental problem is poverty, with hundreds of millions of people around the world, particularly in Asia, living on less than one euro a day.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope Parliament will agree to the proposal in the amendment that I and other Members of Parliament have tabled to host ASEP III early in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We can support the broad thrust of Mr Maaten's report. My only criticism is that an attempt has been made to hijack the report on behalf of the Taiwan lobby. Of course Members of Parliament have a perfect right to do this, but we should be aware of what we are being asked to approve. I would remind Members of the provisions of Rule 9(1), Annex I, Article 1 on declarations of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Socialist Group, I have tabled amendments to attempt to correct these distortions. Yes, we must recognise Taiwan as one of the most important trading entities for the EU, but here we are being asked to go further. If we want to abrogate our support of the one-China policy we followed in the past, we should do so directly, rather than by hiding it within paragraph 35 on the WHO. Membership of the World Health Organisation is restricted to nation states. To demand membership of the WHO for Taiwan is to recognise it as a nation state; to grant it an independence that its own government has not even requested. Equally I am at a loss to see why, if the PPE-DE Group is genuinely interested to allow the fundamental rights of freedom of travel for the President and senior officials of Taiwan's Government, it wants to restrict this to strictly private visits, rather than leave it more open. Otherwise we can only conclude, if they maintain their position, that this is really a subterfuge for opening up a political process that as yet we have not agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">With these reservations, we support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Asia is not only huge in terms of area. It also embraces a range of economic, political and religious differences, which mean that it is particularly challenging to deal with the area in a single report. This has been achieved, however. I shall just highlight a couple of points here.</p>
<p class="contents">In anticipation of the forthcoming ASEM summit in Copenhagen, it must be crystal clear that there is full support for maintaining and developing relations between the EU, the ASEM countries and Asia as a whole. It is first and foremost a question of supporting the struggle to obtain respect for democracy and human rights in Asia. With regard to the global campaign against terror, it is also important for the EU to forge sound alliances with the Asian countries. More extensive relations between the EU and Asia must also play their part in supporting the market economy and sustainable development and, in that way, promoting a prosperous Asia. Simply take a look at recent history and the examples of Japan and Taiwan and it will quickly be very obvious that democracy, the market economy and respect for human rights are the way forward. I must naturally express my delight at the fact that both China and Taiwan are now members of the World Trade Organisation, or WTO. It is of course gratifying to hear the Commissioner confirm that the EU is to open an office in Taipei within a year. Taiwan is the EU’s eleventh largest trading partner and is therefore a very important partner of the EU. Braving possible accusations from Mr Ford, I regret that Taiwan cannot participate in the ASEM Meeting, for example as an observer. By the same token, I also regret that Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organisation, or WHO, not even as an observer. In my view, every democracy in the world should have a place in these international institutions.</p>

There, are, though, a number of problems. Firstly, any consideration of Europe and Asia has to include Russia as well. All the issues touch on the interests of Russia as a great Eurasian power, as became clear only recently in the Korea issue. Both the North Korean president's journey to Siberia and the plans to build a rail link crossing North and South Korea are worthy of a great deal of attention.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, considering the problem more in the unclear light favoured by the USA, and failing to involve Russia and China to the extent they deserve, makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful and fair solution to the problems before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to have an Asia policy without due consideration of the Shanghai Group and its place in Eurasian political events is to ignore the realities of the situation. We must now decide on what the place of Central Asia, for example, is to be and what attitude we take towards the USA's Eurasian strategy, which envisages a new geostrategic situation in this area. The end of the Cold War saw the budding of hope for a peaceful world, and that hope is, unfortunately, waning fast.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the States of the European Union have long disregarded or underestimated developments in Asia and are still persisting in deliberations that are one-sided and sometimes limited. The Commissioner observed that reality has overtaken the report's reference to India and Taiwan in the same breath. That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities. <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> always has something to do with interests, and the EU does well to strike a balance between its own well-understood interests and those of its partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are behaving as if Europe were something other than an appendage to the Eurasian continent, as if it were the centre of the world, and as if Asia were on another continent. The ASEM is certainly a useful forum on cooperation, but it is that only if all the Asian countries belong to it, with, at the least, prominence given to those that are striving to become democratic. For example, I see the ASEM as unthinkable without India.</p>
<p class="contents">Only with the EU's firm commitment is the creation of democracy in Asia a feasible process, and the democratic countries, of which Taiwan is an example, can and must be planted and nurtured as a leavening influence. Taiwan can, one might say, become the engine for the continuing process of democratisation that we want to advance in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, cooperation agreements between Asian countries and the EU – one thinks of Laos and Vietnam – are meaningless unless they are actually adhered to. My primary concern now is with the mountain areas, for Asia has the highest mountains in the world, including the Himalayas, the Karakorum, the Hindu Kush, and also the Pamir Mountains, and it is in these mountainous areas, which, when we look at them on the map, are bigger than the whole of the EU, that we find the greatest trouble spots. Let us consider Tibet. Tibet has its own history and culture. Tibet is of about the same size as Europe measured from Gibraltar to the Urals. Tibet was occupied by China in the 1950s. The intelligentsia and the leaders of its society were driven out of the country. His Holiness the Dalai Lama left the country in 1959 and now lives, with his government-in-exile, in exile in India. The Tibetans were admittedly promised autonomy, which was formally introduced in 1965, but this autonomy is a pure farce. All things Tibetan were increasingly repressed, and the country is being plundered. The railway that is now to be built from Golmod to Lhasa, and which, incidentally, runs across zones of permafrost, which makes little sense, does not serve to keep the country supplied, but to keep on exploiting it.</p>
<p class="contents">In this hybrid system, part-capitalist, part-communist, China has done everything to marginalise Tibetan culture along with this minority. All efforts on our part towards human rights have to date been in vain. This initiation will repress all things Tibetan unless the EU works to counteract it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our next stop is Sinkiang, still today belonging to China and with a sparse Muslim population. It is a vast region in the west of China between the Kuenlun Mountains and the Altai and Pamir ranges.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too there is repression, the violation of human rights and, after 11 September 2001, yet more suppression under the pretext of combating terrorism. No longer is autonomy even mentioned. I wonder whether we Europeans might offer our experience of regional conflict resolution as aid here.</p>
<p class="contents">So we come to Kashmir, Asia's number one trouble spot, a problem dragged out from 1947 onwards, with the divided Kashmir, called Jammu-Kashmir, torn between Pakistan and India. Following many wars between the two countries, soldiers have been facing each other down, in summer and winter alike, at 6 000 metres above the sea, for 15 years. Nuclear war has been threatened. Attempts to resolve the conflict have been unsuccessful. I am not concerned here with apportioning blame to one side or another, but with finding solutions. The indigenous people, the Kashmiris, must of course also be asked, and here too, autonomy is a possible solution, perhaps even shared autonomy for this divided country, and we Europeans have a number of models to offer of how to achieve solutions. As regards autonomy, the same is true of Tibet, of Sinkiang and of various regions in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to Nepal, a small but very densely populated country. Here there are situations resembling civil war and plunging this country – one of the world's poorest – into virtual self-destruction. On the one hand there is a corrupt government, and on the other there are rebels describing themselves as Maoists, fighting each other, each under the pretext of supporting the impoverished rural population. While this is going on, the rural population and tourism, which is this country's sole surviving source of income, get trampled underfoot. This means that our non-governmental financial aid, which has indeed hitherto alleviated a certain amount of poverty, is no longer possible. At the moment, I see no chance of giving this little kingdom at the southern foot of the Himalayas some degree of freedom from its self-destructive dilemma.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has peace been brought to the situation in Afghanistan. The mountainous areas of the Hindu Kush have been laid waste, tourism is impossible there as an economic activity, and the mountainous areas are becoming more and more desolate.</p>
<p class="contents">What we Europeans have to bring about is, firstly, respect for all other lifestyles, the protection of minorities, and, of course economic aid, peacekeeping, education, conflict resolution, and, where necessary, intervention. How, though, are we to play our part in influencing political interaction in the complex entity that is Asia, and how is the EU to play its part in shaping it, if we do not learn to speak with one voice? For as long as the EU fails to thrash out a common foreign and security policy, much of what we want to implement, and should put great effort into implementing, will unfortunately remain nothing more than wishful thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">This last point is unfortunately the most important for us to resolve before we take on our real task in Asia.</p>

It is a powder keg from a security point of view, a baby elephant economically speaking and mainly a source of concern from the point of view of human rights. What is the European Union to do with this region? Mr Maaten's report contains many valuable building blocks for a coherent vision. These are of such high quality that I will support the report, even though I do not see eye to eye with the rapporteur on all scores.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise two points. I will start on a critical note. The report says a great deal about the role that the European Union should play in all kinds of conflicts in the region, but nothing about the relationship with the United States. According to Paragraph 14, the European Union is to point out to the East that Europe has a role of its own, independent of that of America. This is not terribly realistic, for, as is also recognised in Paragraph 14, the EU does not yet have an effective foreign policy and certainly not an effective security policy. I am therefore noting, without any perverse delight, that if Europe is to play any role whatsoever in conflicts of this kind, the EU will inevitably need to work more closely with the United States. After all, not only does the US's military presence guarantee stability, it also adds political weight to the region. The lack of this notion in the report is an oversight, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, along with the rapporteur, I should like to underline the importance of the principles of the rule of law and respect for human rights. Our relations with, for example, China, Indonesia, Burma and Vietnam should be subject to compliance with these fundamental principles. I completely agree with the rapporteur that the only true basis for economic and social progress in the region is to respect human rights and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as he is quite aware, it is very often the case that Parliament produces good resolutions but there is a problem afterwards, and that problem is the Council. Mr Messner is clearly right: there is an institutional problem, but that is not all, There is the problem of the Commission too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder was right to remind us of the need for the strategy. I cannot believe that, even today, we are unable to distinguish between democratic Asian countries and non-democratic Asian countries. We lump them all together with China, with which we have been pursuing a difficult dialogue, not just since yesterday but for a decade now, a difficult dialogue in which we are repeatedly informed by the Chinese leaders that China is a specific case, that there is a specific Asian approach to<span class="bold"> </span>human rights. Have you never thought to tell them that Engels, Marx, Stalin and Lenin were not exactly Asian and that they must stop talking such rubbish?</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not economic, President-in-Office, and our Taiwanese friends are the best illustration of this, for, quite apart from any political or institutional relationship with our countries, they have become a country with 20 million inhabitants which is the European Union’s third largest trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">The businessmen of Taiwan and the European Union have found their own way. It is we who have a problem, and the problem is that a number of countries are at war: in Vietnam, there is currently a Vietnam war against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in China against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in Laos against democracy and freedom. This problem cannot be addressed here. Mr Ford has condemned the initiatives of Mr Jarzembowski and other Members in support of democracy in Taiwan. All this seems to me to be completely incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">I fail to understand this cooperation policy, Commissioner Patten. I fail to understand why we should continue to give money that we know full well will end up in the wallets of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Laotian leaders and have no impact at all. Why, Commissioner, do you not do what you are starting to do with other countries? To do away with all these cooperation projects and give countries EUR 1 million once they have completed this specific democratisation reform. This would eliminate all the European bureaucracy and, therefore, fraud as well, all the disgraceful wastage of our and taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like the Council and the Commission to inform us whether there really is no hope of succeeding in obtaining the release of five ‘disappeared persons’<span class="bold"><span class="italic">. </span></span>Twenty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Europeans marched down the streets calling for the release of the Chilean disappeared<span class="italic">. </span>We are incapable of saving five missing civilians, five ‘disappeared persons’<span class="italic">, </span>in Laos, a country of 5 million inhabitants of minor geopolitical influence. We are not even capable of obtaining the release of the leaders of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who have been in prison for 20 years now. I find all this absolutely unacceptable, not to say incomprehensible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Suominen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (FI) </span>Madam President, Mr Haarder, Commissioner Patten, the report drafted by my colleague, Jules Maaten, on the Commission Communication on relations between the European Union and Asian countries deserves recognition, which is shown by the fact that it was adopted by the Committee by a large majority. I also wish to thank both the Council and the Commission for the forward-looking manner in which they are handling relations between these two areas of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, laid down our group’s major policies in his own distinctive way, one which is both lucid and brilliant, and I will therefore only consider a few details. I would like to draw attention to particular points that for many of us might seem no more than subtleties, but which are of particular importance with regard to our relations, for example, with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">The report raises the issue of the importance that Taiwan holds for us. It is an important trading partner and a community that has progressed a long way in its democratic development. We have, however, accepted the concept of one China despite the fact that we are rightfully concerned about Taiwan’s position and we oppose certain measures or the threat of them. For that reason, if we are to be consistent we cannot treat Taiwan as a fully independent state, a position most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese People’s Republic is a member of the United Nations, and Taiwan is not. Neither can Taiwan therefore be a member of the WHO. Therefore, the form of cooperation that I would also like to see develop must be of another kind. The WHO is a community of independent states.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, this is obviously my personal opinion, but as I have often had the chance to visit mainland China both officially and unofficially since 1985 and have talked with ordinary people and the authorities and followed developments there, I think that human rights there, which really are still nowhere near our idea of what they should be, have also seen some positive developments. Whilst we insist that China make further and faster progress in this area, we should also acknowledge that this has taken place in a country which is important to us in terms of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a staunch opponent of the death penalty but logically we should oppose it everywhere. It is a question of a qualitative, and not a numerical, value. I would remind everyone that in the last ten years around three hundred death sentences have been carried out in Taiwan, with just under a hundred in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately one-third of the world’s Muslim population lives in Asia, which also has the world’s largest Muslim countries in terms of population. The PPE-DE Group believes it is very important to maintain dialogue with these countries and improve knowledge of each other’s cultures, for example, in the form of citizen exchange programmes. For the time being, the vast majority of Asia’s Islamic population accept and comply with their governments’ moderate and, to a greater or lesser degree, democratic policies. The most critical situation is that in Pakistan where democracy has been has been overthrown and terrorist activity continues more or less openly. If, however, confrontation in the Middle East should escalate – intentionally or otherwise – that must also have an impact on Asian Muslim attitudes and the possible rise in fundamentalism in these countries. For that reason it is also very important for our relations with Asia to find a solution to the situation in the Middle East – and that includes both the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Iraqi threat – through cooperation across a wide front using the most universally accepted means possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that, technically, Mongolia counts as a Central Asian country as far as the Commission’s – and therefore also our own – work plans are concerned, but in my opinion it should be part of a more eastern Asia, as in fact it is, geographically speaking. Mongolia, for many reasons, not least because the structures of communism totally vanished there, destroying the industrial structure, but also because of its climatic conditions, has slid into an almost medieval state as far as industry, education and health are concerned. I think this country deserves and, furthermore, needs the sort of first-rate care and assistance the EU has to offer. It cannot get up off the ground unaided. We must not forget this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have followed the matter and read the report, and I found it excellent. I have a few reservations about some of the details, but on the whole it is an exceptionally good report.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, of course, believe it is important for the ASEM meeting in Copenhagen at the end of the month to be a success. The economic issues, which are extremely important for relations between the EU and the ASEAN countries, will naturally be discussed. These key issues have been developed further in recent years. Something we ought to develop further is cooperation in the area of foreign policy, i.e. the EU should join with Asia in adopting a committed role in conflicts around the globe and play a more active part. I therefore believe it was positive that Sweden addressed the Korean question during the Swedish Presidency, and I hope this cooperation can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some experience of environmental issues. With regard to the global environment, I believe it is very important to cooperate with the Asian countries. We have a lot in common and we have the same viewpoints. Since these are global issues, we see that the US is dragging its feet in this area. We know that we need to get the US on board. We stand a better chance of succeeding if we can create a coalition with the countries in Asia around these issues. We must also continue to cooperate on human rights issues, an area in which it has – quite rightly – been said that many of these countries have considerable problems. I remain, however, convinced that dialogue will improve our chances of moving forward in this area, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to dialogue-related issues. I am back from the ASEP meeting in Manila, where I was one of the delegates. Although there were differences between us, I must say that the atmosphere was good. We managed to agree on a joint communiqué. At the Manila meeting we tried to focus on three areas: firstly, terrorism; secondly, environmental issues; and thirdly, human rights issues. We managed to agree on all three.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would stress above all with regard to the fight against terrorism is that it must be conducted under the auspices of the UN and within the framework of international law. It is also important that the UN’s various conventions be ratified. I have already mentioned the environmental aspect, which is a global issue. Global warming is the most important question. It is important that we should all ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Furthermore, we must try to get the US first to sign it, and then ratify it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also discussed the need to mobilise civil society in the context of the environment and of human rights. We are very concerned about the human rights situation, which has been deteriorating in recent years. More cooperation is needed in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Ford said, it is important to have continuity in our relations at government level. At the same time, it is important to have continuity in relations at parliamentary level. I therefore hope that an ASEP meeting can be organised in connection with the next ASEM meeting in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the crisis in Asia, trade and investment relations have expanded to such an extent that Asia is currently the EU's third largest regional trading partner. We can even say that we in Europe have contributed to a relatively swift economic recovery in Asia by means of our open markets and investments. Despite this, a great deal still needs to be done. Our political ties need to be strengthened and broadened. We still do give Asia enough consideration as an important partner in multilateral discussions within international forums, such as the World Trade Organisation. I would, in this connection, refer to China's recent endorsement of the Kyoto Agreement. This is a positive point. Asia is indeed gradually realising that it faces the same global challenges as we do: promoting peace, security, minimum social standards, environmental protection and the fight against cross-border crime and trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know from my own experience that Asians still do not know Europe well enough. This results, for example, in the EU's trade deficit with Asia which, partly due to the crisis, has increased almost tenfold over the past five years. We must therefore step up our presence in the region as a matter of urgency, and make the Asians aware of Europe's – and, above all, of the EU's – significance, so that the trade and investment potential of our companies can also be enhanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, in my view, particularly gratifying that there is a specific focus on dialogue on culture and civilisation, for it is particularly in these times that mutual understanding in this area is particularly important. All too often, there is still great misunderstanding despite the progress made in relations between Europe and Asia, which are distant rather than close, in contrast to relations with the ACP States or Latin America. We have to come to understand that the Asian states are not merely in economic or trading competition with us, but that they are genuinely important partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Mr Maaten's report and also the communication from the Commission make it very clear that the strategic framework also has to highlight priority areas for political and strategic cooperation, in which area the strengthening of the United Nations will, on the one hand, certainly be a point of view that will carry weight, as will without any doubt, on the other hand, the bilateral and, as far as possible, joint efforts at tying the USA into a multilateral relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">In this time of conflict, when we are faced with problems and challenges, it cannot be too often emphasised that it is most important that Asia and Europe should support a multipolar world. This is where we, as Europe's Parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ASEP Summits could emphasise this. I really do consider that important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphatically underline the role to be played by the principle of detente and change through rapprochement in giving human rights and democracy issues priority. What have we achieved in Europe by means of this policy? Why can it not used to give us leverage in Asia? That we should be cooperating with the Asians in this way in the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in other areas affecting stability, is something I consider right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to make another appeal. Another issue here is certainly cooperation between non-governmental organisations, as is the new relationship on the basis of equal rights, partnership and mutual understanding. What, though, will we have achieved if this remains confined to the heads of government, to the business world, or even to the parliaments? We have to include the young people of these continents of ours. With that in mind, I would like to encourage the Danish Presidency of the Council to do even more for the European-Asian summer schools and even more for mutual understanding between the young people of Asia and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent document. I should also like to express my appreciation for the communication by Commissioner Patten. Over the past ten years, the attention given to Asia by the EU has not always been what it should have been. Partly thanks to Commissioner Patten, this attention has been rekindled. This, of course, has something to do with his great knowledge and experience in the area in question. At parliamentary level too, contacts have improved over the past few years, as witness the recent ASEP meeting in Manila. It is also vital that talks should not simply be held at ministerial and official level, but also at parliamentary level. This reinforces the debate on mutual contacts, and the contacts are thus guided and controlled at parliamentary level too. Reinforcing the democratic substance in Asia is certainly no hollow exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few more additional comments, starting with Indonesia. I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has spoken so highly about Indonesia. I should like to say something about Indonesia, because I know the country well and I am also co-Chairman of the newly formed working group 'Friends of Indonesia'. Indonesia is in the throes of becoming a democratic system. The authoritarian Suharto regime has fortunately made way for a democracy under the leadership first of President Wahid and now of President Megawati Sukarnoputri. This process is far from easy, and this is why it is important for that country to receive our support. After China, Indonesia is the region's largest country. We should not forget that Indonesia, in terms of inhabitants, is the world's largest Islamic country. These two elements together mean that Indonesia is of great strategic importance in the region and of great strategic importance in present-day world politics in the light of the events of 11 September last year. Over the summer, the Indonesian Congress, which is a combination of national and regional parliaments, took important decisions which further reinforce democracy. In future, the President will be elected directly by the people and the military power will withdraw from the national parliament in which it still had a preferential position. At the same time, however, we also notice the emergence of an increasing number of fundamentalist Muslim groups which are opposed to freedom of religion in Indonesia. Christian communities too, are under attack on a regular basis. The situation in the Moluccas has often been discussed in this House. Indonesia is vulnerable in this transitional phase to democracy, and this is why the Indonesian government deserves extra support from the European Union. My question to Commissioner Patten is: how could this support be stepped up?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to make an observation about Burma, or Myanmar. Mr Maaten's report states that that country should also become a member of the ASEM group. I would strongly question that. Burma still has a military regime that came to power by deposing a President who had 80% of the votes behind him, by depriving a parliament of its powers, by imprisoning many MPs or having them killed and by adopting a disastrous policy on ethnic minorities, resulting in more than 100 000 refugees in Thailand, among other countries. I have visited these refugee camps. Neither should we forget that Burma tolerates slave labour and is Asia's largest drugs exporter. In this respect, it is in close competition of Bolivia. In my view, such a country does not belong in ASEAN and in the ASEM group. We should instead try to ensure that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi is reinstated as President of the country in a democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about Vietnam. It is interesting to hear that the next Ministerial Conference will be taking place there. Although I am positive about Vietnam, I hope that attention will also be focused on the high number of political prisoners in that country. Mr Pannella has tabled an amendment to this effect. In my experience, it is useful to ask questions about this – and I have done so on numerous occasions – and for the Commissioner to assure that the European ambassador in Vietnam give this matter his urgent attention. I have letters which show that Vietnamese prisoners have been released following pressure brought to bear by Parliament and the European Union. It therefore works. I hope that this aspect will be given due consideration in the debates in Hanoi.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word. The Commission's line on Taiwan receives my unqualified support. I hope that Taiwan will be accorded a place in the ASEM and I also hope we can appreciate that Taiwan is a more important democracy than the vast country of China, which, it is of course also to be hoped, will yet develop in that direction.</p>

Cooperation in this area is so important that one of our partners must not be forgotten. We need both of them! We have, in the course of time, built up very intensive ventures in economic cooperation, and Asia is in any case the European Union's most important trading partner. We have built up good relations in the cultural sphere, but what we need is to step up political cooperation, quite simply because geopolitical conflicts and problems have an effect on the European Union. Consider terrorism, consider internationally organised crime, consider migration, consider environmental issues and the many other problems we have.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the initiatives taken in this report, as well as the Commission proposals, and congratulate the rapporteur on the very precise proposals he has made. I would, though, like to add some of my own, which I believe will further improve cooperation. The first is that we should arrange, in future, for an ASEP meeting to be held, if at all possible, prior to every ASEM Summit, in order to draft tangible proposals and, in second place, in order that we should move on, as Mr Jarzembowski has just said, instead of just putting dialogues on the record in broad terms, to coming to definite decisions and setting out in definite terms for these summits resolutions and objectives that can and must be put into operation.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of us from this House, led by the distinguished Lord Inglewood, took part in the ASEP meeting from 26 to 28 August, at which we were exemplary in so far as we wrapped up a very solid package in the area of counter-terrorism. There I had the opportunity to act as coordinator, and I will ask you, as President of the Council, and you, as the Commission's representative, to incorporate these specific points from the terrorism package at the next ASEM Summit. Let me pick out a number of proposals. We proposed unanimously that the UN should attempt to come up with a uniform definition of terrorism that would then be binding on all our States. We decided on the establishment of a network facilitating cooperation in counter-terrorism, the exchange of information, mutual aid – including aid of a technological nature – in dealing with chemical or bacteriological weapons or the training of experts. At this meeting, we made proposals for security systems in transport by land, sea and air to be improved to defined standards, and we also proposed that, at last, all terrorist acts, including conspiracy, incitement, and membership of terrorist organisations should be classified as serious offences and punished as such in all Asian states.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also resolved that protection and help be afforded to the victims of terrorism. We will be successful in the struggle against terrorism only when Europe itself takes measures that work, when cooperation with the USA is developed and made to work, and if, at the end of the day, we also succeed in developing first-rate cooperative projects with our Asian partners in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I beg you, Commissioner, and you Bertel Haarder, my much-respected former fellow Member of this House, to take account of these proposals from ASEP at the Copenhagen Summit and take them on board.</p>

<p class="contents">The subject of this debate is the European Union's policy towards Asia. However, the policy discussed in Copenhagen will, of necessity, focus on the institutionalised dialogue with the members of ASEM which, as you know, are the fifteen Member States of the European Union, ten Asian countries and the European Commission. In this sense, it is very difficult to deal with all aspects of this area under this one umbrella. However, it is a step in the right direction and I believe that this modus operandi and our involvement in this process is helpful to the European Union's strategy in political and regional partnerships and the multipolar world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would point out that, so far, this dialogue has, for the most part, been held solely at the economic level and it needs to move on to political, educational and cultural issues. It is no accident that China, which recently joined the World Trade Organisation and is staging the 2008 Olympics, is also party to this debate, and clearly the economy and culture also exert a great deal of influence on the development of democratic institutions and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one very important issue which needs to be addressed is the enlargement of ASEM. The European Union will soon have ten new members, making a total of twenty-five. All the members of the European Union belong to ASEM. Obviously, once we enlarge, the other side will ask for other countries in Asia to be allowed to join.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that this political factor is urgent in the extreme and enlargement criteria need to be laid down. I think that the criteria which must, without fail, be adhered to by both sides are the Copenhagen criteria, which improve economic, cultural and, above all, human relations and human rights. I hope, in fact I am certain that successful developments will result from Copenhagen and I believe that this European Union policy will be more widely accepted in an area wracked by conflict and crisis, by which I mean the whole of Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as Mr Pirker pointed out I had the honour to lead the European Parliament's delegation to the ASEP II meeting in the Philippines last week. This event, which was efficiently and successfully organised under the auspices of the Philippine Senate, concluded, as a number of colleagues have said, by issuing an agreed communiqué and statements which dealt with human rights, with special reference to women and children, terrorism and the environment. But at least as importantly, it provided some parliamentary input into the ASEM process, which culminates later in the year with the Copenhagen meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">In an increasingly interdependent world, where modern economics propelled by science, technology and improved transport systems breaks down the significance of national boundaries and with them the practical relevance of ringfenced national jurisdiction, the democratic political process must not get left behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The evolution of governmental, ministerial and Heads of Government meetings that take decisions, which either de facto or de jure legislate or commit their component participants to legislate, should have a proper parliamentary angle and aspect. In my view this is at least as important as many of the conclusions reached by parliamentarians' meetings such as ASEP II. They are the first step towards finding collective parliamentary institutions to work with collective governmental and administrative developments such as ASEM.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the decisions reached by ASEP II in Manila, and the decision of this Parliament in voting for the Maaten report, will endorse the call for another meeting of ASEP to be held to complement the proposed 2004 ASEM meeting in Hanoi. I also hope that this parliamentarians' meeting will be held in Europe, although not necessarily here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the location of the first ASEP meeting in 1996.</p>

I would join in the praise of Mr Maaten’s excellent report. I do not entirely agree with his view that the Council has a minimalist approach towards Asia, for it might just as well be said that relations between the EU and Asia have never been stronger than they are today. It must be remembered that all this activity was certainly not a foregone conclusion. It is in itself an achievement that dialogue is taking place, that trade is increasing, that there are more frequent exchanges between us and that human contacts are being further developed at all levels, including the very highest. That is an achievement in itself. It is very important, and vital as well to our economic well-being in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention the first six meetings that are to take place under the Danish Presidency: the big ASEM Meeting, the meetings of business leaders and of ministers of economic affairs, as well as the summits with Japan, China, South Korea and India which are all to take place in Copenhagen during the Presidency. In addition, there is the summit with Japan which has already taken place. Over and above these, there is a range of contacts at ministerial level and among officials. Mr Solana undertook a major visit to four Asian countries in July, participating in the annual ministerial meeting on security cooperation in the ASEAN Regional Forum where, as is well known, the EU makes efforts towards intensifying cooperation and presses for the move to be made from mainly confidence-building measures to what we call preventive diplomacy. Basic conditions such as respect for human rights, the promotion of democracy and the principles of a state based on the rule of law are central themes in the EU’s relations with Asian countries, and I can assure Mr Messner and others that we shall raise the Tibet issue at the summit with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also involved in a range of problems of regional significance such as relations between India and Pakistan, the situation in the Korean Peninsula and developments in Burma. In my view, the activities we have under way are, then, particularly wide-ranging. Nothing just happens of its own accord and there is nothing that is here and now giving rise to tremendously visible practical progress, but relations are slowly but surely improving, and that is of course how cooperation takes place in terms of the larger frame within which Euro-Asian relations must be conducted. If it comes to making a list, there have of course been very many examples of practical progress, some of them of benefit to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a host of tasks waiting to be carried out, however, and both the Commission Communication and Mr Maaten’s report are very useful tools in this regard. I have also heard Mr Patten say that relations with South-East Asia are an area in which we could well do more. An EU-ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers is planned for January 2003, and this will be a good opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen relations. The communication on relations with South-East Asia, mooted by Mr Patten, may prove to be a valuable contribution to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I can give an assurance that the Council shares the desire to strengthen relations between the EU and Asia. With all the activities mentioned and with everything which has been said here in Parliament and which, I know, is taken note of in the countries we wish to cooperate with, there is a particularly sound basis for the range of activities we are now getting under way under the Danish Presidency. Finally, I want to say that we shall follow with interest the efforts to arrange another ASEP meeting, or Asia-Europe parliamentary meeting. I myself took part in the first meeting here in Strasbourg, and I look forward to its being possible to arrange something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
