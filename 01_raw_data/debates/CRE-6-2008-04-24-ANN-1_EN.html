<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The priority actions for reducing supply are laid down in the EU Drugs Strategy for the period 2005-2012 and the subsequent EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008. These actions include:</p>
<p>– strengthening law enforcement cooperation at EU level and between the Member States,</p>
<p>– prevention and punishment of the import and export of narcotic drugs, including towards the territories of the other Member States,</p>
<p>– enhancing law enforcement, criminal investigation and cooperation in the field of forensic science, and</p>
<p>– intensifying law enforcement efforts directed at non-EU countries, especially producer countries and regions along trafficking routes.</p>
<p>Also of great importance are the EU Presidency’s efforts to reach agreement on a Council resolution on Europol which will increase the powers and adaptability of that organisation and provide Community funding.</p>
<p>The Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre on Narcotics (commonly referred to as MAOC-N), which was set up last autumn in Lisbon (and involves seven Member States), has already made some significant seizures.</p>
<p>To combat effectively the illegal EU market in synthetic drugs, the EU is using a new procedure for information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances. The EU has used this procedure most recently in connection with the new psychoactive substance 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) on which the EU Council adopted a Decision establishing control mechanisms and criminal sanctions against the new psychoactive substance 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) in the EU Member States in March this year.</p>
<p>In the field of foreign relations cooperation has been established with the producer countries, in particular through the action plan for Afghanistan and the Latin American and Caribbean Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism on Drugs.</p>
<p>During the Slovenian Presidency of the EU Council there has been a high-level meeting between the EU and LAC at which the Hofburg Declaration, which sets out further EU cooperation with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, was adopted.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis is also placed on the Balkan route. In this context mention should be made of the action plan for the Western Balkans. This is an important instrument for assisting the Western Balkan countries with regard to drugs and at the same time provides a certain degree of protection against drug trafficking along the Balkan route.</p>
<p>West Africa has become a new priority area. At the fifty-first session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna the Slovenian Presidency, following the drafting of a text for the Horizontal Working Group on Drugs, proposed, on behalf of the EU, that a resolution on West Africa be adopted. This resolution will make it possible to reduce the flow of cocaine to the EU via the countries of West Africa.</p>
<p>The European Union and the Member States are the largest donors in the world. In their relations with the producer countries they are continuing in particular to focus on alternative development, to exchange intelligence and to strengthen institutions.</p>
<p>As regards prevention and treatment, the strategy for the period 2005–2012 provided for a demand reduction approach based on:</p>
<p>– preventing people from starting to use drugs,</p>
<p>– preventing experimental use becoming regular use,</p>
<p>– early intervention for risky consumption patterns, and</p>
<p>– providing treatment programmes and rehabilitation and social integration programmes.</p>
<p>The EU Action Plan for 2005–2008 lays down 20 action points. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon is of key importance in this respect.</p>
<p>As part of the action plan, in 2007 the Council discussed the production and cross-border trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis and the exchange of information on drugs, drugs in prisons and drugs on the street. An integrated, evidence-based approach was proposed for all the above.</p>
<p>The Commission departments are currently assessing implementation of the 2005–2008 action plan which will form the basis for drawing up the action plan for the period 2008–2012.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0171"></a>

The President of the European Council is to chair it and drive forward its work and to ensure the preparation and continuity of the work of the European Council in cooperation with the President of the Commission, and on the basis of the work of the General Affairs Council. The President of the European Council is to endeavour to facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Council and present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings of the European Council. The President of the European Council is, at his level and in that capacity, to ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0173"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council agrees with the European Parliament that the reliability of energy supplies for Europe is of major importance. The European Council clearly confirmed this fact in its decisions in 2006 and 2007. Thus, it is also one of the Community’s principal internal and external policy objectives to safeguard and strengthen security of energy supplies, together with competition and sustainable development, as was reaffirmed in the European Council decisions of March 2007. Furthermore, the importance of increasing the energy security of the EU and its Member States was also set out by the European Council of March this year. It is important to stress that action on climate change and energy, further liberalisation of the internal energy market and new energy technologies are making an important contribution to this objective.</p>
<p>However, we must continue resolutely to develop the external dimension to energy policy for Europe for the period 2007-2009. The March European Council therefore welcomed the progress made in this field. Progress on implementation and the need for further action on the external dimension to energy policy will be assessed more fully on the basis of the strategic review of energy policy which will be presented by the European Commission in November 2008. This strategic review will be given over in particular to reliability of supplies (including in connection with interconnectors) and external energy policy. The strategic review, which the European Council will confirm in spring 2009, will form the basis for a new energy action plan post-2010.</p>
<p>The main elements of the Community’s internal and external energy policy, which will contribute directly and indirectly to greater reliability of supplies, are:</p>
<p>– Internally:</p>
<p>More legislative instruments, such as the directives on oil stocks, security of gas supplies and security of electricity supplies.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Community’s energy network: the objective of Community energy policy is to create a stronger and better connected energy network and better network management and infrastructure planning and to speed up the incorporation of new power stations into the electricity network; all this helps to increase the network’s ability to deal with shocks, such as interruptions to supplies, accidents and variable flows from renewable resources.</p>
<p>Greater use of renewable resources (binding target of 20% of EU energy use by 2020 and 10% of biofuels in fuel for transport by 2020).</p>
<p>Greater energy efficiency. Reduced energy use will decrease dependence on third countries as regards energy supplies; therefore the Community’s objective is to increase energy efficiency by means of the instruments at its disposal (legislation, research and development, and a promotional campaign).</p>
<p>In connection with the Trans-Europe Energy Network (TEN), the Council would like to draw the Member’s attention to the last year’s appointment of coordinators for four priority projects of European interest – including the Nabucco gas pipeline through which gas from central Europe is supplied from the Caspian region – to promote the implementation of these projects, which are very important for reliable supplies of energy and the operation of the internal energy market.</p>
<p>– Externally:</p>
<p>The European Union is actively seeking greater security of energy supplies through diversity of energy resources, suppliers and supply routes; in addition to the abovementioned TEN projects of European interest this is also done by means of:</p>
<p>regular dialogue on energy and cooperation with major producer countries and organisations, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Norway and OPEC, and also with major consumer and transit countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, India and Ukraine;</p>
<p>energy partnerships, for example with Africa, established in December 2007, and with Egypt;</p>
<p>close cooperation with the countries of Central Asia, the Caspian region and the Black Sea as part of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on energy (the Fifth Ministerial Conference was held on 17 December 2007 in Cyprus) etc., and active participation in structures such as the Energy Community and the Energy Charter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0182"></a>

<p>In its conclusions on ‘Recently emerging issues regarding HIV/AIDS’ of 23 April 2007<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Council encouraged the Commission and Member States to ensure fulfilment of existing commitments within the ‘EU Programme for Action on HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through external action’ and called on the Commission and Member States to report on progress, including on these emerging issues regarding HIV/AIDS, in the context of the joint monitoring and reporting on the European Programme for Action in 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p>In that connection the Council will assess the present state of implementation of the 2005 programme for action<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and any measures adopted in this field by the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p>In its ‘Annual Report on the European Community’s Development Policy and the Implementation of External Assistance’ to the European Parliament and the Council the Commission reports each year in particular on the availability of EC funds for implementing the programme for action. The 2007 Annual Report on EC external assistance in 2006<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> contains information which shows that in connection with poverty reduction the European Union is increasingly involved in the fight against diseases linked to poverty, in particular through implementation of the European programme for action. A vast array of instruments and channels of financing are being developed, primarily through bilateral programmes financed by the EC budget and through the European Development Fund, and amount to approximately EUR 245 million a year excluding general budget support .<a href="#defann_5_4" name="refann_5_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission and the Member States have been active donors to the ‘Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)’ since it was established in 2001–2002. The EU is also playing a crucial and visible role in the development of a new and innovative method of international funding, which emphasises its firm commitment to fighting these three diseases. The EU and the Member States together have become the biggest donors to the GFATM since they provided 53% of the cash contributions in 2003–2006. The EU is an extremely important development partner and therefore its political support is of crucial importance to the successful development and operation of the GFATM, for example in the efforts to provide predictable financial flows in connection with the replenishment process.</p>
<p>The EU is at present implementing a European Programme for Action to tackle the critical shortage of health workers in developing countries (2007–2013), in which Africa is a priority geographic goal. A Commission progress report is expected soon.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS has in fact hit Africa hard. The Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the ACP countries and the EC applies to the majority of African countries. Promoting the fight against HIV/AIDS, protection of sexual and reproductive health, and the rights of women in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) are among the areas of support in connection with the cooperation strategy<a href="#defann_5_5" name="refann_5_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and activities in this field are normally funded by the EDF.</p>
<p>The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)<a href="#defann_5_6" name="refann_5_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, which the European Parliament and Council adopted on 18 December 2006, includes addressing poverty diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, though geographic programmes. The Development Cooperation Instrument’s programme ‘Investing in People’ includes, in the section ‘Good health for all’, the fight against poverty diseases, targeted at the main communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS among them. A financial reference amount of EUR 1 060 million has been earmarked for the period 2007–2013. Dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its effects on Southern African society is one of the objectives of EU aid for Southern Africa in connection with the Development Cooperation Instrument; a financial reference amount of EUR 980 million is earmarked for that geographical programme for the period 2007–2013.</p>
<p>The fight against HIV/AIDS with particular emphasis on Africa is and remains the most important priority of the EU, both internally and externally. The Council expressed this clearly in the EU statement ‘Keeping the promise to stop HIV/AIDS’ on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2007, as did the European Council in its conclusions of 21/22 June 2007.<a href="#defann_5_7" name="refann_5_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, one of the four principle objectives of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership,<a href="#defann_5_8" name="refann_5_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> which was approved at the Lisbon Summit on 9 December 2007, is ‘to ensure that all the Millennium Development Goals are met in all African countries by 2015’ and HIV/AIDS is among the global challenges and issues of common concern which will be tackled together in this long-term strategic partnership. In that respect a broad range of objectives are planned, such as:</p>
<p>improved access to prevention, treatment, care and support services, including for HIV/AIDS,</p>
<p>greater financial and human resources,</p>
<p>improved access to affordable quality medicines and commodities, and</p>
<p>increased capacity of African countries to train and retain qualified health workers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, 2008 will be a year of measures to implement the policies and instruments for the fight against HIV/AIDS and it is hoped that the positive trend in terms of efforts and success that we noted in 2006 and that was reportedly also seen in 2007 will continue in 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Article 165 of the consolidated version of the founding treaties, as amended by the Lisbon Treaty, is to be found under Title XII, Education, Vocational Training, Youth and Sport. It is one of the internal policies and actions of the Union. Article 165 states, inter alia, that the Union is to contribute to the promotion of European sporting issues, while taking account of the specific nature of sport, its structures based on voluntary activity and its social and educational function. However, the Member’s question does not fall within the competence of the Council since it did not participate in the intergovernmental conference which drew up the draft Lisbon Treaty.

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council considers that one of the fundamental reasons for the success and swift implementation of the data exchange mechanisms laid down in the Prüm Treaty, which will be set out in the Council Decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation (see the ‘Prüm’ Decision),<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and its implementing decision, is the fact that that the decision does not affect national legislation and national structures. Article 2 of this decision clearly stipulates that it is for the Member States to decide on the treatment of data stored on the national database of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Each Member State also decides which parts of its DNA database it will make available to the other Member States for searching and comparison purposes. This information is published in a manual drawn up and supplemented by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not for the Council to determine the kind of persons whose data has to be or could be exchanged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United Kingdom authorities decide which data will be used and/or made available for searching and comparison purposes under the ‘Prüm’ Decision.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the data exchanged under the Prüm Decision is very limited and the information on the types of persons to which the data relate, and their status, may be exchanged only if and when a ‘match’ is established.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 18 February 2008 the Council adopted the following conclusion: ‘The Council reiterates the EU's adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, inter alia the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and all UN Security Council resolutions. It underlines its conviction that in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under SCR 1244, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles and resolutions.’</p>
<p>The fact that the case of Kosovo is unique is emphasised by UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which was adopted by the UN Security Council following the humanitarian tragedy during which almost 800 000 of Kosovo’s inhabitants were forced to leave their homes and regional stability was endangered. This resolution introduced interim UN administration in Kosovo and provides for a political process to determine Kosovo’s future status. On the basis of a report by Ambassador Kai Eide, which was presented to the Security Council on 7 October 2005, the UN Secretary-General recommended that a start be made on the process of determining Kosovo’s future status in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and appointed a special envoy to carry out this process. The process is intended to bring about the effective cooperation of the Kosovar Serbs and other nationalities and communities in Kosovo.</p>
<p>Since Kosovo is a unique case, it is not regarded as a precedent for other situations – including situations within the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0213"></a>

But, arguably, all EU Member States are faced with this misconduct to a greater or lesser extent. One way to look at this problem is to try to close all loopholes, which would involve the status of current tax havens. But there is a broader aspect at stake here, which is the social responsibility of people at the apex of economic, and sometimes political, power; when they misbehave so blatantly they not only bring their reputation down, but they also deal severe blows to the functioning of our institutions.</p>
<p>How does the Council intend to broaden the scope of the fight against tax evasion to the area of moral accountability and the need to prevent the erosion of our citizens' confidence in democratic institutions?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At the start of the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) in October 2005, the Council and the Commission decided that they would sign the SAA once progress in the following three areas had been jointly assessed:</p>
<p>development of a legislative framework and establishment of administrative capacities for the proper implementation of any SAA,</p>
<p>efficient implementation of the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and</p>
<p>full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Commission was to report to the Council on the outcome of the assessment.</p>
<p>The first point does not present any particular difficulties. In the latest progress report, dated November 2007, the Commission emphasised the progress that had been made in reforming the public administration and found these reforms to be in line with European standards on the whole. In the context of negotiations on the SAA, Serbia has shown that it possesses good administrative capabilities. In view of Serbia’s institutional capacity, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in the conclusions of its December meeting, expressed confidence that the country would be capable of accelerating its preparations on the road towards the European Union.</p>
<p>The second point is no longer applicable, because the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro no longer exists. As regards the third point, the Council has stressed the importance of full Serbian cooperation with the ICTY several times in the conclusions adopted at its meetings. A satisfactory resolution of these issues is also one of the conditions for the signing of the SAA. An important indicator of fulfilment will be the content of the next report from Serge Brammertz, Prosecutor of the ICTY.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0222"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to assure the honourable Member that e-justice is a major priority task, the purpose of which is to create a European technical platform in the realm of the administration of justice which serves to provide access to all present and future national, Community and possibly even international electronic systems.</p>
<p>The Council is examining the scope of the e-justice system and the precise content of the gateway. Regardless of the result of this examination, the future e-justice gateway is intended to give the general public and lawyers uniform access to legal information, judicial authorities, registers, databases and other available services, thereby facilitating their daily work in so far as it relates to European judicial matters.</p>
<p>The Council has already discussed the timetable for opening the gateway the public. The Commission has announced a communication, which the Council will take into consideration in its subsequent debates. It must be emphasised that the Member States will have to check and test the gateway for any technical or organisational problems and ensure that it will operate efficiently before making it publicly accessible.

<p>During the course of my cooperation with experts on the Council regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, I came across an opinion which I found so surprising that I thought I should bring it to the Council's attention. The author is a well-known authority on atomic physics. In the opinion, hydrogen and fuel cells were presented in such an enthusiastic manner as to appear almost a panacea for all energy and environmental problems. It must be remembered, however, that hydrogen is merely an energy carrier. In order to produce it, other energy sources need to be used, with, depending on the technology employed, varying degrees of efficiency, ranging from a few percent (normal electrolysis at room temperature) to 80% (high-temperature decomposition of water). If methane or natural gas were to be used, it would be necessary either to produce them or to purchase them from somewhere.</p>
<p>What is more, storage and transport are another difficult problem that needs to be addressed in order to make use of this energy carrier.</p>

<p>The honourable Member may rest assured that the Council is well aware of the complexity of the technical challenges that need to be addressed in connection with the widespread use of hydrogen and fuel cells in the European transport system. This is reflected in the general introduction to the draft Council Regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, in which the Council states that the challenge posed by fuel cells and hydrogen is of great complexity and scale and that technical skills in these fields are very widely dispersed (document 6935/08, recital 9 on page 4). The task of experts in the field of research and development is therefore to assess the technological and economic potential of fuel cells and hydrogen, identify theoretically promising technological developments and examine the associated technological and economic challenges before a decision is taken on their use on the basis of well-founded and compelling scientific evidence. Scientific documents sometimes tend to present the potential applications of new technology as panaceas. In some cases, such documents merely list all the potential uses of the technology in question which require further study. The findings of a comprehensive study may reveal that few or none of the potentially highly promising applications are likely to prove successful in practice. That, however, is the way in which scientific progress is normally achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0238"></a>

<p>The Council has not yet adopted a position on the Commission communication to which the honourable Member refers on the future of the European agencies.</p>
<p>Some of the legal instruments establishing European agencies stipulate that the progress and working methods of the agency in question are to be assessed, or else they contain a review clause. Under Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 establishing a European Railway Agency, for instance, the Agency’s working methods and the results of its activities are subject to evaluation by the Commission, which may present a proposal for changes to the provisions of the Regulation. The Regulation establishing a European Food Safety Authority provides for an independent internal review, to be commissioned at six-yearly intervals by the Authority in cooperation with the Commission. The Council is not involved in that revision unless it is followed by a legislative proposal for the revision of the instrument establishing the Authority.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Council, as the two arms of the budgetary authority, adopted a joint statement on Community agencies on 18 April 2007, in which they invited the Commission:</p>
<p>to provide annually a budgetary overview covering all existing and future Community agencies, including budgetary information regarding their founding instruments, key budgetary indicators and staff numbers and the ratio between operational and administrative expenditure;</p>
<p>to carry out a thorough cost-benefit analysis and systematically apply and promote the procedure envisaged in paragraph 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement before establishing any new agency,</p>
<p>to assess the Community agencies on a regular basis, focusing particularly on cost-benefit ratios, and</p>
<p>to implement the review clauses contained in the regulations establishing the respective agencies.</p>
<p>The Council is currently examining the Commission’s proposals on electronic communication and the framework for electronic communication and has not yet adopted a position on the Commission’s proposal for the establishment of a European Electronic Communications Markets Authority.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council shares the view that the international community must not close its eyes to conditions in Somalia. The Somalian question therefore remains high on the Council agenda.</p>
<p>The High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, held a meeting in February 2008 with Nur Hassan Hussein, the new Prime Minister of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).</p>
<p>The EU Troika visited Mogadishu on 25 March 2008, holding talks with the President and the Prime Minister, with the chiefs of the the Hawiye clan, with representatives of civil society and with the Commander-in-Chief of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The objectives of the Troika visit were:</p>
<p>to signal the support of the EU for the new Government and its planned programme of priority measures,</p>
<p>to proclaim the full support of the EU for the effective strategy of conciliation between the TFG and the Opposition at all levels with a view to ensuring that the transitional period is brought to a successful conclusion,</p>
<p>to express the desire of the EU for better coordination within the leadership structures in the institutions of the Transitional Federal Government, and</p>
<p>to maintain the role of the EU as a player acting in support of a lasting political solution for Somalia and coordinating its activities with those of the international community under the aegis of the UN.</p>
<p>On several occasions the Council has stressed the importance of the leading role of the UN in the provision of international support for the political process in Somalia and of the need to avoid initiatives working at cross-purposes. It has also expressed its support for AMISOM, the African Union Mission to Somalia.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council has stated that the EU must actively support measures designed to promote respect for human rights, to foster a sense of responsibility and to eradicate the culture of lawlessness in Somalia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0245"></a>

The reason given by the Croatian authorities for this brutal violation of fundamental democratic rights was the visit of US President Bush to Croatia.</p>
<p>Does the Council condemn such acts, which seek to terrorise and obstruct the political activity of progressive youth and which flagrantly violate the fundamental democratic rights of young people?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is not familiar with the details and circumstances of the case of Vinko Drača, to which the question refers.</p>
<p>It nevertheless wishes to assure the honourable Member that the general position of the EU on adherence to the elementary principles of democracy and human rights and its commitment to these principles are crystal-clear. As a state engaged in negotiations on accession to the EU, Croatia must fulfil the political criteria laid down at the Copenhagen meeting of the European Council; in other words, it must possess sufficient institutional stability to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and protection of minorities.</p>
<p>With regard to the requirements laid down in the framework of the accession negotiations, Croatia is also expected to continue its reform process and make further progress in applying the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law which underpin the European Union.</p>
<p>All of these matters are discussed at the meetings of the Stabilisation and Association Council, the next of which will be held in Luxembourg on 28 April, as well as at the accession negotiations, under the heading of justice and fundamental rights. In addition, the competent Council bodies will continue to pursue these matters and monitor the implementation of the revised Accession Partnership.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that it will continue to keep a close eye on the issue of fundamental rights and will ensure that it is addressed at the appropriate levels.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0252"></a>

<p>On 13 December 2007 the European Parliament passed a resolution <a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2007-0632_EN.html">P6_TA(2007)0632</a> which, amongst other things, called upon the Japanese Government formally to accept historical and legal responsibility for the subjugation and enslavement of ‘comfort women’, and to refute publicly any claims that these atrocities never occurred.

<p>The Council has familiarised itself with the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 13 December 2007 on justice for the ‘comfort women’ (sex slaves in Asia before and during World War II).</p>
<p>The EU attaches particular importance to the rights of women and to the issue of violence against women.</p>
<p>In conformity with international human rights standards and with the ethical and constitutional principles that are common to all Member States of the European Union, the EU calls on non-Community countries time and again to honour the resolutions adopted by the bodies of the United Nations and to begin implementing laws and measures designed to ensure the utmost respect for women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>In this context, we point out that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 stated that women’s full and equal enjoyment of human rights was a priority objective of the international community and that governments and the United Nations should intensify their efforts to achieve it.</p>
<p>The EU and Japan regularly discuss human rights issues at the ministerial meetings of the EU Troika and Japan.</p>

<p>The measures to which Mr Guerreiro refers were adopted by the Council in 2003. It took this action in response to the prison sentences imposed on 75 members of the peaceful opposition who had been campaigning for freedom of expression. Cuba, for its part, decided to freeze relations with the authorities of those EU Member States whose embassies had invited members of the peaceful opposition to celebratory functions on national holidays. In 2005, the European Union unilaterally revoked the measures enacted in 2003 in an effort to normalise EU-Cuban relations again.</p>

The Union remains willing to make an active contribution, through development cooperation and in other ways, to the future development of all sections of Cuban society.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to remind the Cuban authorities of their obligation to promote respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Cuban nationals, not least in view of Cuba’s membership of the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>The Council thanks the honourable Member for her interest in this important matter. The fight against cancer is a major priority of the Slovenian Presidency in the realm of public health. Following the recent conference entitled The Burden of Cancer – How Can It Be Reduced?, which was held in Brdo pri Kranju, Slovenia, on 7 and 8 February 2008, the Presidency will present Council conclusions for adoption at the Council meeting of 10 June 2008.</p>
<p>The Presidency will propose that the Council ask the Commission to present an EU action plan for the fight against cancer based on the fundamental principles and strategic objectives set out in the White Paper entitled Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU, 2008-2013;<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the action plan should cover all aspects of a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to cancer control, including cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.</p>
<p>The European Community and the Member States are making untiring efforts to prevent and control cancer on the basis of the available evidence by means of initiatives and measures designed to promote public health and prevent illness by encouraging healthy lifestyles. These efforts focus on reducing tobacco consumption, promoting healthy diets and physical activity, reducing dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol, screening for early diagnosis, lessening the impact of physical, chemical and biological carcinogens in the workplace and in the environment and ensuring the safety of food products with a view to minimising the risk of developing cancer.</p>
<p>Prevention remains the most effective long-term strategy for reducing the increasingly heavy burden of cancer. A consistent approach to the promotion of public health and primary prevention with the aid of appropriate measures in various legislative areas and in various fields of activity would help to prevent cancer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The recent NATO Summit held on 4 April 2008 decided to deploy the US anti-missile defence system on the territory of Poland and the Czech Republic and to extend participation to other Member States of the EU.

The argument on which this ban is based is unacceptable and dangerous, namely that the Czech KSM is 'in favour of the socialisation of the means of production', which shows that this unacceptable decision forms part of the more general anti-communist campaign unfolding in the EU, which aims to persecute and criminalise communist ideology and anti-imperialist activity.</p>

<p>The Commission is currently analysing the transposition of Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has transposed this Directive in particular through the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003. While it is still too early to give a definitive assessment of the conformity of those Regulations with Directive 2000/78/EC, the Commission would like to comment on the points raised in the question.</p>
<p>Under Article 4(1) of Directive 2000/78/EC, it is possible to justify a difference in treatment if a particular characteristic is a genuine, determining occupational requirement. This possibility exists only in relation to the nature of the particular occupational activity concerned.</p>
<p>Under the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, the Commission notes that an employer can apply a requirement relating to sexual orientation in respect of employment for an organised religion if the aim is to comply with the doctrines of the religion or, in order to avoid a conflict, with the strongly held religious convictions of a significant number of the religion's followers. The Commission considers that such provisions could be held to be compatible with the Directive, provided that there exists a genuine, determining occupational requirement which fulfils a legitimate objective and which is applied in a proportionate manner.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of heterosexual persons against discrimination, it should be noted that the ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation applies in a similar manner to homosexual and heterosexual persons. A heterosexual person would therefore be protected against potential discrimination in the same way as a homosexual person.</p>
<p>The "causality test" in cases of discrimination is laid down in Article 2 of the Directive, which defines discrimination. Direct discrimination based on sexual orientation occurs where a person is treated less favourably than another person in a comparable situation because of his or her sexual orientation. Indirect discrimination occurs where a neutral rule or practice has a disproportionate impact on persons of a given sexual orientation, unless the objective pursued is legitimate and is applied in a proportionate manner. It should also be noted that Article 10 of the Directive allows the burden of proof to be reversed where the person claiming to be the victim of discrimination can establish a presumption of discrimination: in that case, it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Articles 145 to 148, to which the honorable Member refers, will be the articles relating to employment policy, which is to be one of the policies to be developed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Those articles are, in fact Articles 125 to 128 of the prsent EC Treaty and have not been amended by the Treaty of Lisbon. The European institutions will not therefore be able to adopt binding employment measures as they do at present. Hence European cooperation on employment is derived from the European Employment Strategy, which is based on the open method of coordination, in which the Council and Commission agree on the broad lines and joint objectives and on the possibility of adopting specific recommendations.</p>

<p>The Commission notes that demographers tend to be very cautious when it comes to attributing demographic phenomena, such as a change in the number of births, to any specific social policy measure. The relatively high birth rates in Norway are likely to result from a range of different socio-economic and cultural factors. While the Commission has not carried out evaluations of specific measures, it has concluded, on the basis of a wide range of available evidence, that family support which promotes better reconciliation of work, private and family life is most likely to reduce the gap between the desired and the actual number of children people have.</p>
<p>The Norwegian parental benefit scheme promotes reconciliation of work and family life by offering a high level of benefits (80% to 100% of previous earnings up to a limit of around € 50 000 per annum) for a short period of 44 or 54 weeks (the longer period only at the lower rate of 80% of previous earnings). Six weeks of the paid parental leave are reserved for the father and cannot be taken by the mother. Thus the scheme encourages a rapid return to the labour market and, notably by offering a full replacement of lost earnings up to a high ceiling, creates the conditions for fathers with higher earnings than their partners to take parental leave<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In May 2007 the Commission published a Communication "Promoting inter-generational solidarity"<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which includes an overview of family support policies in the EU and responds to the European Council's call for a European Alliance for Families, a European platform for the exchange of information, good practice and research results in the area of family policies;</p>
<p>The Commission has launched a consultation of the European social partners in accordance with Article 138(3) of the EC Treaty on the subject of reconciliation of private, family and work life, including the possible revision of Directive 96/34/EC<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on parental leave. The consultation procedure has advanced to the second stage and, depending on the final outcome, the Commission may decide to put forward proposals to supplement existing legislation in the area of reconciliation;</p>
<p>In June 2007, the Commission set up a new government-expert group on demographic issues comprising representatives of all 27 Member States. In 2008, the expert group decided to focus on the evaluation of family policies and policies in the field of active ageing;</p>
<p>Various projects funded under the EU framework research programmes and studies on family-related topics will increase knowledge of demography and family policies. The Commission is also supporting the OECD in order to speed up the development of its new family indicators database;</p>
<p>The Commission will continue the series of biennial demography forums and reports. The next demography forum is scheduled to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 November 2008 and the second demography report is to be published in time for the forum. Both the forum and the report will give attention to reconciliation policies.</p>
<p>The Commission is in contact with a wide range of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on family related issues. In particular, meetings and seminars, to which NGO representatives are invited, have been held in connection with the meetings of the government expert group on demographic issues. One of these seminars, which took place in November 2007, focused on child care and a further seminar on family policies is envisaged for June 2008. Furthermore, the web portal of the European Alliance for Families will provide a forum for contacts and exchange of information between relevant organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A recent study from the UK's Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) on shopworkers' experience of work-related violence and abuse shockingly details the awful abuse, threats, harassment and violence meted out by the very customers they seek to serve<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

I am aware that the European framework agreement on harassment and violence at work, signed on 26 April 2007, refers to violence from third parties such as clients, customers, patients and pupils. However, this issue is not included in its provisions.</p>

<p>Following the consultation initiated by the Commission in 2005 under Article 138 of the EC Treaty, on 26 April 2007 the social partners concluded an independent agreement on harassment and violence at work. The Commission suggests that the honourable Member refer to the answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-1130_EN.html">E-1130/08</a> by Mr De Rossa, which describes the purpose and content of the agreement.</p>
<p>In particular, the introduction to the agreement recognises all the possible forms of harassment and violence that might occur in the workplace. Violence by 'third parties', such as customers, patients, school pupils, etc., are expressly referred to and covered by the agreement, but are not the subject of specific provisions.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concerns of the honourable Member as to the need to take all forms of violence into account, including third-party violence. That form of violence often requires a different response that might be outside the scope of the company. At the request of several organisations of social partners in certain sectors affected by problems of third-party violence at work, such as private security, hospitals and commerce, the Commission held a multi-sector seminar on third-party violence in Brussels on 14 March 2008. The social partners in those sectors jointly expressed the intention of considering the possibilities of adding to the interprofessional agreement to make it more specific, sectoral and/or multi-sector. The seminar is the first stage in that process, which might lead to the opening of multi-sector negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the independent agreement on harassment and violence at work makes a very positive contribution to the prevention of all forms of violence and harassment at work and that it would be appropriate to await the results from its implementation and any sectoral additions before assessing the need for other Community initiatives in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Crystalline silica is a basic component of soil, sand, granite, and many other minerals. Quartz is the most common form of crystalline silica. It causes silicosis, a slow, progressive, disabling disease. It also causes lung cancer and there is evidence that it causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>The WHO already classifies crystalline silica as a class 1 carcinogen to which 3.2 million workers are exposed for over 75% of their working time. In addition to this, 2.7% of deaths from lung/bronchial cancers are due to crystalline silica (source: European Agency for Occupational Safety and Health).</p>
<p>I would like to see crystalline silica included in a revised carcinogens directive and for the SCOEL (Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits) to set a binding exposure limit as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share my wish? If so, can it set out a timeframe for this to be achieved? If not can it set out how it intends to ensure that the 3.2 million workers referred to above can be adequately protected?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The main effect in humans of inhaling silica dust is silicosis. Epidemiological studies reveal, in addition, an association between exposure to crystalline silica dust and an increased probability of developing lung cancer. As a result, crystalline silica has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organisation, as a group 1 carcinogen to humans. The EU has not yet classified crystalline silica as a carcinogenic substance.</p>
<p>There is sufficient scientific information to conclude that the relative lung cancer risk is increased in persons with silicosis, but not, apparently, in employees exposed to silica dust in quarries or in the ceramic industry but without silicosis. The first step to reducing the cancer risks is therefore to prevent silicosis. The full implementation and enforcement of the prevention strategy laid down in Directive 98/24/EC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will be effective in preventing the onset of silicosis, it will also reduce the cancer risk, and it will ensure that the 3.2 million workers exposed to crystalline silica are protected.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits has discussed respirable crystalline silica extensively and has issued a Recommendation to the Commission<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It concludes that, although a clear threshold for silicosis development cannot be identified, the occupational exposure limit should lie below 0.05 mg/m<span class="sup">3 </span>of respirable silica dust.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica should be adequately protected. It will evaluate the effects of the practical implementation of Directive 98/24/EC in terms of reducing exposure levels to crystalline silica dust and, in particular, the results achieved as a result of the implementation of the multi-sectorial social dialogue agreement on "Workers health protection through good handling and use of crystalline silica and products containing it"<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

<p>Efforts at EU level to combat poverty and social exclusion mainly take place under the Open Method of Coordination. Each year the Joint Report on social protection and social inclusion informs the Spring European Council of developments in the fight against poverty and exclusion<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Council has just adopted the 2008 Joint Report.</p>
<p>The analysis in that Joint Report shows that there are worrying indications of persistent joblessness in households in the EU: approximately 10% of children and the same percentage of adults aged 18-59 (excluding students) live in households where no one works. This rate has not improved over the last six years. Another significant factor is "in-work poverty": 8% of the working-age population fall into this category, and one poor person in four is in employment (Eurostat data, 2005 income year).</p>
<p>Improving the situation of people on the margins of the labour market, including the working poor, by addressing their specific needs is therefore a key challenge for Europe. Periods of economic growth that stimulate job creation provide in principle an opportunity for many people on the outer edges of the labour market to find a (better) job. But the right conditions have to be in place to ensure they can actually make use of those opportunities.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Strategy, underpinned by the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (and in particular Guideline 19), provides a framework for the Member States to develop employment policies specifically addressing the needs of people on the fringes of the labour market. In 2006 the Commission conducted a public consultation on the scope for European action on active inclusion and minimum income. The concept of active inclusion is based on three policy pillars: a link to the labour market through job opportunities or vocational training; income support at a level that is sufficient to live in dignity; and better access to basic services.</p>
<p>On the basis of an analysis of replies to the consultation<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission decided to launch the second-stage consultation in which it announced its intention of issuing a recommendation on common principles for implementing the active inclusion approach.</p>

<p>The question raised by the honourable Member relates to cross-border health care. As regards payment for health care in another Member State, under Community law patients can already be reimbursed for treatment in another Member State.</p>
<p>Under Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security systems, the insured person uses his health insurance and treatment is paid for at the rates of the State in which the treatment is provided, with, if necessary, a differential supplement if the reimbursement rate for the treatment is more favourable in his own Member State than in the Member State where he receives the treatment. The nationality of the person is immaterial. That system covers the treatment required during a stay, using the European sickness insurance card, and non-urgent treatment for which the competent authorities have authorised the patient to seek treatment in another Member State. The Court has clarified the conditions in which such authorisation cannot be refused. The rules are explained on the Commission website in all the official languages.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that, by application of the principles of free movement to health services, patients may be reimbursed for health care received in another Member State. In the case of non-hospital treatment, patients may obtain a refund without prior authorisation. In such cases, reimbursement is based on the charges of the State to whose health care scheme the patient belongs. For hospital treatment, the Court has agreed that Member States may continue to require prior authorisation in the interests of public health, to enable services to be planned nationally. In that instance, the Court stated that any authorisation granted under Regulation 1408/71/EEC for treatment in another Member State would require application of the coordination mechanisms under Regulation 1408/71/EEC.</p>
<p>The rights brought to light by the Court of Justice judgments in the various cases are clear, but patients need to be more aware of them. As confirmed by the public consultation organised by the Commission in 2006, there is a need to clarify the position with the mechanisms guaranteeing rights to reimbursement of health care provided in another Member State, and the efficiency and safety of cross-border health care.</p>
<p>With a view to attaining those objectives, a proposal for a directive on the exercise of rights of patients with regard to cross-border health care will be submitted to the Commission for adoption in June 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0239"></a>

<p>As regards the question of gender differences, the Commission has not received notification of the draft law reforming the Greek social security system and cannot therefore provide any assessment of the retirement ages or of the issue of reconciling work and family life.</p>

<p>As regards the last point in the question, it appears from the Commission's assessment in the annual implementation report that Greece has taken action to promote female employability and reconcile work and family life, including targeted training and counselling actions; nevertheless, the situation for elderly females remains difficult, and indicates a need to refocus attention.

<p>The Commission is currently drafting a proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. The Commission is expected to adopt the proposal in May 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission regularly consults the Member States and the organisations representing disabled people, including the European Disability Forum, through the High-Level Group on Disability. At its last meeting, for instance, replies to an extensive questionnaire on progress in ratification/conclusion and implementation of the UN Convention were dealt with. Such consultations will continue.</p>
<p>On 27 February 2007 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0077">COM(2007)77</a>). The Council adopted a Decision dated 20 March 2007 authorising the Community to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and issued a declaration on the Optional Protocol (Annex II to the Decision) to the effect that the Council would reconsider as soon as possible the question of the signing by the European Community of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Commission considers that the Council is now in a position to take a final decision on how to proceed with the Optional Protocol.</p>
<p>As required by Article 44(1) of the UN Convention and Article 12 of the Optional Protocol, at the time of formal confirmation the European Community has to declare the extent of its competence regarding matters governed by the Convention. The extensive screening Community legislation has been carried out in the meantime.</p>
<p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities contains provisions that fall within both the Community sphere of competence and that of the Member States. The Community and the Member States should jointly define the precise mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the Convention in areas of shared competence. The nature of those mechanisms will be set out in the Commission proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Convention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0244"></a>

<p>The Commission is convinced that it is necessary to harmonise administrative sanctions in order to effectively fight Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
<p>The Proposal aims (i) to strengthen the ability of Member States to ensure that, in a single market, operators do not take advantage of different sanction systems at national level to the detriment of the common policy and (ii) to take provisional action to prevent the continuation of the IUU activity identified.</p>
<p>It is up to each Member State to ensure that Community law is properly enforced and Member States may regulate their own sanctions' system in the manner they consider most appropriate as long as the sanctions have a deterrent effect in accordance with the Proposal.</p>
<p>The IUU proposal will harmonise the levels of administrative sanctions to be applied by Member States in case of a serious infringement by operators carrying out IUU fishing activities.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that levels of sanctions must be harmonised in order to ensure that any economic advantage will be more than offset by the sanctions imposed. Operators will only stop carrying out IUU fishing once the administrative sanctions reach a level that is no longer regarded as part of normal operating costs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0168"></a>

<p>Food traceability and food information are distinct instruments with different objectives.</p>

<p>Therefore, where the origin, provenance or source of a food is indicated on its label, it is not in the context of traceability. The EU labelling legislation states that such information is mandatory only in cases where its omission could mislead the purchaser.</p>

<p>As regards animal welfare and trade issues, there are no binding multilateral agreements in force directly addressing this issue and animal welfare is in particular not explicitly addressed in the Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary agreement under the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>This is a major cause for concern for the Commission. As a consequence, the Commission developed in 2002 a specific strategy to address the competitiveness implications for EU producers resulting from animal welfare systems for caged birds. Several initiatives to promote animal welfare as a competitive advantage, as stated in the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010, have already been undertaken.</p>
<p>Bilateral agreements with Chile and Canada already include a chapter on animal welfare. Furthermore, a co-operation agreement with New Zealand was signed in 2007. An increasing number of trading partners are today monitoring the developments with interest and are evaluating possibilities on how to co-operate with the EU on this issue that is of growing importance especially in developed countries.</p>
<p>A Eurobarometer survey of 2006 stated that 89% of the consumers think that imports should be produced under the same animal welfare conditions as those originating from the EU. Therefore the Commission is presently evaluating the options for an animal welfare labelling system and intends to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council in 2009. Such a system should be WTO compatible and would allow EU producers to highlight the high animal welfare standards in the Community to consumers, who in turn are increasingly insisting on such higher standards in their purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>The ban of the "unenriched cages" systems was adopted by Council in 1999<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, prohibiting new installations from 2003 and giving more than 10 years to the European poultry sector to convert into alternative systems.

The Commission considers that it is up to each producer to make its own choice in this regard and for the Member States to enforce the Directive.</p>
<p>Information available shows that consumers are increasingly concerned by the ethical and sustainable aspects of food production in Europe, including for food processed products, although they are in general unaware on current farming standard and actual requirements. The Commission will continue to study the best possible options so as to support producers that are meeting those expectations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The high-level conference on mental health on 13 June 2008 will highlight that mental well-being in the population supports public health in the EU. It also contributes to successful learning and working, and to social cohesion.</p>
<p>However, mental disorders belong to the most prevalent and serious illnesses in Europe. In extreme cases, they can lead to suicide.</p>
<p>In recent years, suicide levels declined slightly from 11.9 cases per 100 000 of population in 2000 to 10.6 cases in 2006.</p>
<p>But the situation remains unsatisfactory, given that the EU seeks to ensure a high level of human health protection in its Community policies and activities:</p>
<p>- suicide still causes more deaths in the EU than road traffic accidents;</p>
<p>- enlargement increased the inequalities between Member States. In several of them, suicide rates belong to the highest in the world.</p>
<p>The June 2006 European Council confirmed the need for action: it made "Improving mental health and tackling suicide risks" an objective of the Renewed EU-sustainable development strategy.</p>
<p>The high level conference will therefore invite Governments to engage in an exchange to identify how they can most effectively reduce levels of suicide, and depression, which is one of the key risk factors. The purpose is the adoption of a Mental Health Pact which could serve as the basis for future actions in the promotion of good mental health, the prevention of mental ill health in young people, the elderly and minorities as well as the fight against social exclusion and discrimination against people in mental ill health.</p>
<p>Partners in the health sector, regions and communities, in schools and at workplaces will be invited to join the efforts.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the growth of interest in health matters in today's world. It maintains the current competences in health and does not extend the legislative powers of the EU, while reinforcing the scope for supporting action for public health at EU level.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight just a few novelties that the Lisbon Treaty will bring for EU citizens in the area of health:</p>
<p>- The "well-being" of the peoples of the EU is added as an overall aim of the Union.</p>
<p>- The Charter of Fundamental Rights gets a binding legal force, including the right to health care.</p>
<p>- A strengthened basis is introduced for incentive measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross border threats to health, including measures on tobacco and the abuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>It is the Commission's intention to continue developing the EU health policy taking into account the novelties of Lisbon Treaty. The new Health Strategy for 2008-2013 outlines the areas and provides for a methodology where the Commission sees the need for EU wide action to provide health gains.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the reports from animal welfare organisations about the problems for the horses transported for slaughter.</p>
<p>The correct implementation of the Regulation on the protection of animals during transport is a top priority for the Commission.</p>
<p>Member States have the primary responsibility to give effect to EU legislation in this respect.</p>
<p>Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, Commission's experts have performed missions in Member States to verify that the competent authorities have put in place the appropriate measures to apply the EU legislation.</p>
<p>In particular, specific missions on the transport of horses were conducted in 2007 in Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Italy where significant trade of horses takes place and follow-up missions are foreseen for 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission has also initiated actions against the Member States which failed to implement measures to enforce EU rules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several new instruments to improve enforcement have been introduced by the new Regulation in 2007 such as the use of navigation system for long journeys.</p>
<p>This tool will improve controls and make targeted actions possible. For that purpose, the Commission has presented to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health a draft Regulation setting out harmonised standards for navigation systems in December 2007. The Commission expects the standards to be adopted before summer 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing an impact assessment in order to examine the possibility of bringing forward by the end of this mandate a proposal on travelling times and space allowances which takes into account available scientific knowledge.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Regular epidemiological studies would make a significant contribution to removing the anxieties of part of the population regarding the impact of GSM masts on human health, as also to adopting rules to reduce that impact.

<p>The Commission is well aware of concerns of the public about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from mobile telephony, in particular base stations ("masts"). However, it is scientifically generally accepted that most of the exposure of the public from mobile telephony comes from the use of the handsets and not from the base stations.</p>
<p>The Commission has already supported research on EMF from mobile telephony under the Framework Programmes for Research. It is continuing to do so. One epidemiological study worth mentioning is the INTERPHONE project, due to produce its final results within a few months.</p>
<p>In the absence of EU competence to legislate on the matter, the Council adopted in 1999 Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0-300 GHz), based on the best science available. Since then, the Commission has been monitoring its implementation regularly and has consulted several times its Scientific Committees to see whether it should be adapted in view of new scientific developments.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has confirmed that for Radio Frequency (RF) fields, so far no health effect has been consistently demonstrated at exposure levels below the limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and proposed in the Council Recommendation.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is funding through the Sixth Framework Programme a high-level experts group under the project EMF-NET. This group has evaluated all evidence known up to 2006 on potential health risks related to masts. Its main conclusion is that 'the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to health due to radiofrequency and microwave exposure (that is the working frequencies of the radio masts)'.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen future opinions, the SCENIHR has recommended the following research for the RF frequency range:</p>
<p>- A long term prospective cohort study to overcome limitations found in existing epidemiological studies;</p>
<p>- A specific study on the health effects of RF exposure in children;</p>
<p>- A study of the exposure distribution in the population now made possible through the advent of personal dosimeters;</p>
<p>- The replication of several experimental studies using high-quality dosimetry.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to promote research in this area. The most recent call for proposals under the Environment theme of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research contains a topic on health impacts of RF exposure in children and adolescents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0260"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member regarding the two fatal cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease identified in Spain.</p>
<p>While these cases are tragic and unfortunate, there is currently no need to take extra risk management measures above those which are already in place and are very strict.</p>
<p>With regard to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, a decrease in positive cases has been detected in Spain and there are no elements which indicate that the situation is not under control.</p>
<p>Provisions of the current EU legislation have been followed, and the two cases were promptly communicated to the Early Warning and Response Authorities in the Member States, and to the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to monitor the epidemiological trends of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) through the EURO-CJD project, funded under the EU Public Health Programme, in collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p>As of April 2008, a total number of 201 variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases have been reported by 7 Member States.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the epidemic, the United Kingdom has reported 166 cases, including the 3 cases acquired by blood transfusion; France 23; Ireland 4; Italy 1; The Netherlands 2; Portugal 2 and Spain 3. The time-trends confirm that the number of cases has been declining since 1999.</p>
<p>Three cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been associated to blood transfusion. This link has been excluded in these two Spanish cases. Nonetheless, the blood issue must remain a concern for the future.</p>

<p>Two kinds of modification of the Cosmetics Directive should be distinguished. Amendments to the corpus of the Cosmetics Directive, which aims at modifying or introducing new Articles into the Directive and adaptations of the Annexes of the Directive, which are based on technical progress and new scientific knowledge. At the beginning of 2008, the Cosmetics Directive, adopted in 1976, had already been amended seven times and adapted forty eight times. The frequent adaptations result from management decisions to amend the annexes in order to implement opinions from the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products.</p>
<p>The Cosmetics Directive is based on the principle that the person responsible for placing the cosmetic product on the Community market is liable for the product’s safety. To this end, this person must keep available to the competent authorities, by means of a “product information file”, information demonstrating the safety of the product. In particular, the assessment of the safety for human health of the finished product, taking into consideration the general toxicological profile of the ingredients, their chemical structure and their level of exposure must be available within this “product information file”, which is checked on an ad hoc basis by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>The principle of manufacturer responsibility is supplemented by detailed regulation of selected individual cosmetic ingredients. Indeed, the Cosmetics Directive sets out a list of substances which cannot be included in the composition of cosmetic products (Annex II) and a list of substances which cosmetic products may not contain, outside the restrictions and conditions laid down (Annex III). The Directive also contains “positive lists” for colorants (Annex IV), preservatives (Annex VI) and UV filters (Annex VII). Concerning these groups of ingredients, only the substances listed in the respective annex are allowed for use in cosmetics in the EU. Adaptations of these annexes require the prior consultation of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products to ensure that the regulation takes into account the present state of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The modifications over a span of more than 30 years have led to inconsistent terminology and rules appearing in the wrong context. This was aggravated by the fact that the Cosmetics Directive does not contain lists of definitions and has never been codified (i.e. all the amendments have never been formally incorporated into a single legal text). Clarification was required in particular as to the notion of “person responsible for placing the cosmetic product on the market”. Lastly, the need of more coherent terms in the annexes, which is by and large a scientific and technical exercise, was stressed by stakeholders.</p>
<p>For these reasons and with the objective to significantly simplify the Community's cosmetics legislation, the Commission adopted on 5 February 2008 a proposal for a recast of the Regulation on cosmetic products. In addition, the proposal adapts the legislation in view of innovation and developments in order to ensure the safety of cosmetics products.

<p>The criteria for classification of medicinal products as prescription or as non-prescription are harmonised in Community legislation. Directive 2001/83/EC specifies the situations in which medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription. In this regard it is foreseen that a medicinal product shall be subject to medical prescription if, when utilised without medical supervision, it is frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, or if, even when used correctly, it is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health. The directive also allows for the possibility, at Member State level, to provide for certain sub-categories of medicinal products subject to special medical prescription.</p>
<p>For medicinal products authorised by the Commission, the supply status is determined in the authorisation and applies throughout the Union. For nationally authorised medicinal products, it is up to the competent authorities of each Member State to classify medicinal products when granting a marketing authorisation according to the existing criteria of Community law. Decisions on prescription status can vary from one Member State to another. The Commission's proposal to harmonise the supply status of nationally authorised medicines was not retained by the legislator during the last revision of the Directive 2001/83/EC.</p>
<p>As only national authorities have comprehensive knowledge about the medicinal products authorised in the respective Member States, the Commission does not possess the necessary information to draw up a single harmonised list of over-the-counter medicines. However, according to Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the European Medicines Agency is building up a database on medicinal products which is accessible to the general public<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. As foreseen in the Regulation, priority is given to medicinal products authorised by the Community, but the database shall subsequently be extended to include all medicinal products placed on the market within the Community.</p>
<p>The retail distribution of medicinal products is not regulated by Community law. It is up to each Member State to decide where non-prescription medicinal products are available which has led to different retail systems as the Honourable Member rightly observes. The Community law provides however for obligatory package leaflets for every medicinal product in order to ensure full information of the patient irrespective of the retail system. The package leaflet has to reflect the results of consultations with target patient groups to ensure that it is legible, clear and easy to use. In addition, for non-prescription medicinal products, instructions for use have to appear also on the labelling. The Commission considers this framework to function effectively so that a campaign at European level does not seem appropriate. If the Honourable Member possesses more detailed information, the Commission would be happy to look into this in order to see together with the Member States whether further action is needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Article 1, paragraph 24, relating to Chapter 1, Article 10 A, paragraph 2, (Principles and aims) states that the Union shall ‘(d) foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of developing countries, with the primary aim of eradicating poverty'.</p>

<p>Whereas paragraph 2 of Article 10A of the Treaty on European Union refers to the objectives, which include for the first time the eradication of poverty as a primary aim, paragraph 3 specifies that these objectives shall be pursued in the implementation of the different areas of the Union's external action and that the Union shall ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between these and its other policies. Thereby the Treaty of Lisbon gives, if and when ratified, a solid legal base to Policy Coherence for Development (PCD), a principle that is already a legal obligation under the current Treaty Establishing the European Community (Title XX on development cooperation).</p>
<p>The EU through its concept of Policy Coherence for Development aims to build synergies between the relevant internal and external policies and the development objectives. In 2005 the EU took PCD commitments in 12 policy areas<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These commitments were confirmed at the highest political level in the European Consensus on Development<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The EU has been paying considerable attention to increasing the coherence of its policies with development objectives including in the fisheries and trade sector.</p>
<p>With its trade policy the EU has established a market access regime which is quite favourable for developing countries. The average Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) import duty rate is 6.9% overall (4% for non-agriculture products and 18.6% for agriculture products)<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In the context of the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) exports from Developing Countries (DCs) enjoy a 0% duty rate or receive a 3,5 percentage points discount on this rate (see section on GSP below). Goods from Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) and the great majority of ACP Countries enjoy quota- and tariff-free access to the EU market under the 'Everything But Arms Initiative' (EBA), or under interim and full Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that also improve rules of origin.</p>
<p>However, to facilitate developing countries' closer integration into the world economy, it is important not only to reduce market access barriers, but also address a range of other factors, including those relating to individual DCs' own competitiveness and supply side capacity.</p>
<p>EU trade policy is multi-dimensional – multilateral, regional/bilateral and autonomous. Under each of these dimensions, it includes elements that respond to the particular needs of DCs and support their further development and beneficial integration into the global trading system, including through achieving an improved performance on the EU market.</p>
<p>The EU is also very actively engaged in the provision of Aid for Trade to DCs to support them in tackling the challenges of integration both at the regional and global level. In this context, regional integration is one important way to improve the position of DCs and their ability to compete in international markets, by creating larger regional markets and improving the general business environment.</p>
<p>The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that are being negotiated with the ACP countries are conceived as long-term partnerships based on a comprehensive approach to development. They are a tool to support regional integration and sustainable development and will therefore contribute to enhanced policy coherence. The full regional agreements to be negotiated on the basis of the interim agreements will accommodate the specific interests and situations of the regions. The comprehensive EPA concluded with the Caribbean is the example of a balanced and development-friendly agreement. Its trade provisions fully exploit, for the benefit of Caribbean countries, the asymmetry and flexibility offered by international trade law. More importantly, these provisions are embedded in a broader development framework that includes strong social and environmental chapters and detailed provisions on development cooperation.</p>
<p>Since the 2002 reform of the Fisheries Policy, the EU has undertaken to replace all existing fisheries agreements with a new generation of Fisheries Partnership Agreements by 2008. The objective of this new generation of agreements is no longer to just secure access for the European fleet, but also to support the partner country's fisheries policy with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing. A percentage of the financial contribution attached to the agreements is set aside for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over recent months various stakeholders and the media have put particular focus on healthy eating in schools. The Commission is pleased to take this opportunity to inform the Honourable Member about the current Community programme being applied in the educational establishments, and possible future programmes.</p>
<p>The school milk scheme:</p>
<p>The school milk scheme aims to provide healthy dairy products to pupils in kindergartens and primary schools (also in secondary schools if the Member State chooses) at a reduced price compared with normal commercial prices. The reduction is obtained through a subsidy granted by the Community. In 2007, the subsidy was increased to €18.15 /100 kg of milk, irrespective of its fat content.</p>
<p>The school milk scheme has an important role to play given its social and health-oriented character. By providing quality products containing important vitamins and minerals the scheme encourages a healthy way of eating while ensuring a proper nutritional education and establishing a positive long-term impact on consumption of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that in order to increase the success rate of the school milk scheme, the implementing provisions should be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission's services are reviewing the school milk scheme in view of simplifying its management and enlarging the list of beneficiaries and eligible products. The proposed changes in the system will soon be presented in the Management Committee concerned with a view, once adopted, to apply them from the beginning of the new school year.</p>
<p>The possible school fruit scheme:</p>
<p>When approving the Common Market Organisation for Fruit and Vegetables reform, the Council issued the following declaration: "In light of the dramatic increase in obesity amongst schoolchildren, which has been highlighted in the recently published Commission White Paper, the Council invites the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a school fruit scheme as soon as possible based on an impact assessment of the benefits, practicability and administrative costs involved."</p>
<p>In keeping with the Commission's commitment to better legislation, the presentation of a 'School Fruit Scheme' proposal will be conditional on the conclusions of an Impact Assessment demonstrating its value added at European level and analysing the advantages and drawbacks of different options. To help bring together the range of expertise necessary for this assessment and to facilitate the preparation of the proposal, this work has been entrusted an Inter-Service Group (ISG) made up of representatives of the Commission.</p>
<p>So far, the ISG has elaborated four options for a European "School Fruit Scheme", which have been submitted to a public consultation from 18 December 2007 to 29 February 2008. The Commission now continues to work on the Impact Assessment report, which will include and integrate the results of the public consultation. A proposal is scheduled for adoption by the Commission in July 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0181"></a>

<p>Article 169 of the Lisbon Treaty does not differ from Article 153 of the present EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Both Article 153 in the present EC Treaty and Article 169 in the Lisbon Treaty provide for a high level of consumer protection all over the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission's position on the meaning of "a high level of consumer protection" is detailed in the Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013 which it adopted on 13 March 2007<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This makes clear that the level of consumer protection is not defined in a mechanistic way (quartiles, countries, averages) but in the light of what is appropriate to ensure a proper functioning of the Internal Market both for the consumers and businesses. Thus, the strategy's main objectives are:</p>
<p>to empower EU consumers</p>
<p>to enhance EU consumers' welfare in terms of price, choice, quality, diversity, affordability and safety.</p>
<p>to protect consumers effectively from the serious risks and threats that they cannot tackle as individuals.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives the strategy identifies five priorities:</p>
<p>better monitoring of consumer markets and national consumer policies</p>
<p>better consumer protection regulation</p>
<p>better enforcement and redress</p>
<p>better informed and educated consumers</p>
<p>putting consumers at the heart of other EU policies and regulation</p>
<p>In the framework of the Treaties consumer protection does not constitute an overarching issue which takes precedence on other issues.

<p>At its party congress in December 2007, the ANC adopted a resolution on the establishment of a media tribunal. It would be a State institution answerable solely to Parliament.</p>
<p>Many independent journalists fear that this institution would undermine the system of self-regulation inherent in the media. Self-regulation in the media is one of the most important criteria for ascertaining whether a country is genuinely democratic. This principle is also supported by the human rights commission of the African Union. In a word, in a country where a State institution controls what journalists write, freedom of the press is jeopardised.</p>

Now the Finnish Ministry of Finance has announced that it is considering negotiating with the Commission in order to find an out-of-court settlement in the dispute. Apparently Finland is planning to apply for time-limitation of the effect of the ECJ’s ruling and is thus trying flagrantly to ignore the approximately 18 000 cases pending in the national courts.</p>

<p>A holistic approach to the ecosystem is one of the most important basic principles of environmental and nature conservation, and of a competitive fisheries policy.

Cormorants are water birds whose numbers have been rising sharply in central Europe over the past few decades as a result of strict EU protection measures. There has been a 75-fold increase in bird populations, and this is causing severe damage to fisheries. The feeding pressure on species of fish that are already at serious risk and the damage to the European fishing industry have taken on unacceptable proportions.</p>

<p>As with all wild bird species naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States, the Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo, is covered by the general scheme of protection of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and its deliberate capture and killing, disturbance, destruction of its nest or taking of its eggs can only be allowed by Member States in accordance with the derogation system of the directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that there are conflicts between fisheries interests and Cormorants in certain parts of the Community and it has encouraged Member States to make full use of the derogations provisions of the Birds Directive, where this is justified in the absence of alternative solutions, in order to prevent serious damage to fisheries. This derogation system is being used in different Member States.</p>
<p>While there may well be situations where Cormorants present a serious risk to endangered species of fish, the derogation system is equally applicable in this context as there is an explicit provision in the Birds Directive for use of derogations 'for the protection of flora and fauna'.</p>
<p>It is for each Member State to take the measures it considers necessary to manage populations and any conflicts that arise in relation to fisheries interests. Nevertheless, the Commission encourage co-operation between Member States on this issue and has on a number of occasions initiated discussions on this subject with the committee for adaptation to technical and scientific progress, set up pursuant to Article 16 of the Directive (the so-called Ornis Committee).</p>
<p>The Community has also supported multinational cooperative research projects aimed at reducing the conflict between cormorants and fisheries on a pan-European scale. The completed REDCAFE<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> project highlights the dynamic and complex nature of this issue not only from an ecological perspective but also within the social, cultural and economic perspectives. One of the conclusions of this project was that calls for a common standard ‘solution’ to Cormorant-fisheries ‘problems’ are perhaps premature and may well, ultimately, be inappropriate. The work started under REDCAFE is being further developed under a more recent project called INTERCAFE<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

The struggle for scarce resources is likely increasingly to involve good land, as the mainstay for food production. As a matter of fact, good land is turning into a strategic asset, reflecting the way other countries use non-renewable energy resources as strategic assets. Is it not ominous that, already, we are facing a visible trade-off between the prices of food and energy produced from grain? In view of this geopolitical and economic background how does the Commission envisage the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) over the longer run?

<p>Agricultural prices increased in 2006 and 2007 and most analysts share the view that the the market will remain firm in the medium-term. At the global scale, there is broad agreement on the reasons why demand is currently outstripping supply – production disruptions, rise in commodity demand, changes in dietary patterns, high global economic growth rates and new market outlets like biofuels.</p>
<p>This contrasts with our experience in the past, where there has been rather a problem of too much supply and too low prices, and explains the introduction of supply control measures like quotas and set aside and the general thrust for Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, since 1992, to strengthening competitiveness and increasing market orientation by moving away from a policy of price and production support to direct producer support.</p>
<p>In the context of the 2003 CAP reform, the positive market signals in many sectors can now be much better transmitted to EU farmers and can be expected to give rise to a corresponding production response. On the other hand, in the forthcoming "Health Check" of the CAP, the Commission is of the view that the various adjustments being considered, and in particular the removal of the set-aside and phasing-out of the milk quota regimes, will provide the additional land and supply potential necessary to help meet the current increase in demand.</p>
<p>In the longer timeframe, food supply and land use issues have consistently been a feature of the Union’s discussions regarding the CAP and we can expect them to remain so in discussions on the future of the CAP, which are taking place in the context of ongoing EU Budget Review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0219"></a>

<p>The unelected Commission refuses to carry out the joint wish of the elected Council and the elected Parliament by making a study for which money was allocated by them in the 2008 Commission Budget.</p>
<p>The Commission written answer to <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0135_EN.html">H-0135/08</a> (11 March 2008) tries to defend itself by stating that its policy ‘aims to improve cooperation between the Member States’ respective police forces’.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the question of its apparently closed mind to examining new ideas, what are the changes that make the Commission confident that such cooperation, until now extremely poor in the face of exponentially increasing cross-border crime, will improve?</p>

<p>The Commission considers that police coopération in the EU is already producing encouraging results, although there is, of course, still room for improvement. Thus Europol, the European Police Office, is playing an important role in the fight against organised crime, as demonstrated recently by the success of Operation Koala against an international paedophile network and the dismantling of illegal printing works involved in counterfeiting euros.</p>
<p>Its future legal framework should further improve the quality of the support it provides for Member States, whilst allowing closer democratic scrutiny of its activities with the Community financing of the European Police Office.</p>
<p>Eurojust, the European Union judicial cooperation unit, also plays a prominent role by coordinating investigations and criminal prosecutions of cross-border organised crime at European level. The implementation of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JAI) should also be mentioned in that connection.</p>
<p>In addition, incorporation of the provisions of the Prüm Treaty in European law will facilitate the exchange of information, particularly on DNA data. The initial results of the treaty are very positive; several criminal cases have been solved by a comparison of national data files and, as the system becomes stronger, it should soon be more efficient.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that it is required to carry out a study, as it is with pilot projects and preparatory action. In this instance, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to have a study made of what the honorable Member calls 'a federal European police force'. Such a police force is not feasible at the moment, when the Member States are cooperating bilaterally in dealing with cross-border crime as pragmatically as possible. That is mainly the role of the police and customs cooperation centres that several Member States have set up on their common borders.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0226"></a>

<p>With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007, the border between the two countries became an internal border of the EU. This border plays an important role in allowing the free movement of people, goods and services between the two Member States.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is only one bridge (Ruse-Giurgiu) over the 350-km river border between Bulgaria and Romania, which hinders contacts between citizens on either side of the Danube.</p>
<p>At the same time, both countries are continuing to impose tolls on all vehicles crossing the bridge, which hinders free movement between the two new Member States. In many of its judgments, the European Court of Justice has ruled in favour of protecting freedom of movement from tolls that may have a negative impact on the internal market.</p>

<p>The Commission follows closely the situation of human rights in Cuba. As a rule, the Commission Delegation in Havana coordinates its action with the EU Member States in the field, notably in the context of the work of the EU Human Rights Working Group. As cooperation with the Commission and with most Member States was suspended in 2003 by the Cuban authorities (following the 2003 diplomatic measures), the intervention capacity of the Commission in this area, as in any other area in Cuba, in the field is at present very limited.</p>
<p>During the contacts between the Commission and the Cuban authorities, in Brussels and in Havana, a wide range of issues are discussed including human rights matters. The Commission is of the opinion that these questions would be best addressed in the framework of a formal EU-Cuba political dialogue. In 2007, Cuba established a bilateral human rights dialogue with Spain, but it has made the lifting of the diplomatic measures a condition of the possibility of establishing a human rights dialogue with the EU, as well as the resuming of EC-Cuba development cooperation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Contrary to the Honourable Member's information there is no change proposed to Article 2(2) and Article 8(1) of the Regulation (EC) No. 796/2004. The definition of pastureland in force has remained unchanged since many years.</p>
<p>Under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payments to farmers made in the form of the Single Payment Scheme are based on the available agricultural land on a farm.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the financial interest of the European Union, the Commission has established rules that permit to determine eligible agricultural land and to exclude non-eligible areas.</p>
<p>The legislation referred to lays down the types of land eligible for receiving CAP payments and in particular forage / pastureland in which there is mixed vegetation and that is used for an agricultural activity.</p>
<p>To define if a land with trees falls under this category of land or is to be considered as a "forest", and is thus not eligible for aid, the Commission has established already in 2003 and made available to all Member States a document (AGRI/60363/2003) indicating that "areas of trees inside an agricultural parcel with a density of &gt;50 trees/ha should, as a general rule, be considered ineligible. Exceptions may be envisaged for tree classes of mixed-cropping such as for orchards and for ecological/environmental reasons. Eventual exceptions must be defined beforehand by the Member States". The rule is thus not new.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member can see, the Commission does not lay down an absolute rule for the whole of the Community. Sweden can thus for the future for ecological/environmental reasons define for particular types of pasture land a different threshold, if it is proven that the higher number of trees per hectare does not render the land unsuitable for agricultural activities, and thus ineligible for aid. </p>
<p>That the land recognised in this manner is indeed compliant with the applicable EU-legislation and is thus eligible for aid will be assessed in the context of the audits under the clearance of accounts procedure.</p>
<p>In respect of the € 70 million repayment referred to by the Honourable Member, this figure cannot be traced in any decision of the Commission and therefore the Commission is not in the position to provide any details on that issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Contrary to what is indicated by the Honourable Member, the Commission fully respects the judgment of the Court of First Instance in case T-58/05 and recognises its obligation to pay half the Applicants' costs. However, like all other judgments of the Community courts in direct actions, the judgment only lays down the principle as to who shall bear which costs but does not set the amounts to be paid. Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance ("RP") lays down a procedure under which the Court can fix the amount of costs if the parties are unable to agree it. It is only if there is such an order that there is an obligation to pay a particular amount. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>In the present case, there is a dispute between the parties about what is a reasonable amount of costs. The Commission does not agree with the amount claimed by the Applicants which seems to be well in excess of what could be justified in the light of the case-law on recoverable costs in the Community courts. The Commission believes that for sound financial management requires it to keep to the principle of that case law.</p>
<p>The Commission does not however wish to force the Court of First Instance to rule on this case under Article 92 RP, if that can be avoided. It has therefore made what it regards as a reasonable offer to the applicants' counsel, taking account of the principles in the case-law, and also the particular features of the present case. Applicants remain of course free to have recourse to Article 92 RP and ask the Court to fix the amount.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0237"></a>

<p>The Commission is supporting the Nord Stream project in the interests of the whole Union. It is a major project (55 billion cubic metres of gas per year), which will make it possible to meet the growing demands of the industries and citizens of the Union (over 100 billion more cubic metres will be needed by 2015). The project was declared of European interest in the latest guidelines for trans-European energy networks adopted by the Council and Parliament in September 2006<a href="#defann_76_1" name="refann_76_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has not allocated financial support for investment in Nord Stream, which is financed solely by its private shareholders and by loans. It is for the shareholders alone to decide whether the project is too expensive and hence a financial risk for them.</p>
<p>It is not true to say that the Commission is not interested in other gas pipeline projects. Yamal II has the same level of priority as Nord Stream in the trans-European network guidelines adopted in 2006 and Amber is also considered to be a project of common interest.</p>
<p>The Commission agreed to co-finance a feasibility study for Yamal II and Amber submitted by the Polish gas company PGNiG in 2005 (for the sum of EUR 950 000).

<p>The Action Plan "Pierre de Coubertin" annexed to the White Paper on Sport and which will guide the Commission's sport-related activities during the next years underlines in its proposed actions under chapter A.5 the need for a better use of the opportunities which sport offers to foster social inclusion in and through sport.</p>
<p>To make the implementation of the White Paper a success, the Commission will rely on an improved structured dialogue with the sport movement and an enhanced political cooperation with EU Member States.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Open method of coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion, the social inclusion strand highlights, through the 2006-2008 national strategic reports submitted by the Member States, the importance of participating in sport activities as a means to prevent and tackle social exclusion of children on the one hand, and on the other hand as a tool for promoting the social inclusion of immigrants and ethnic minorities. It should be also noted that within the context of the OMC, a number of indicators on the well-being of children have been envisaged and participation in sport activities is included in the elements to be taken into consideration. The OMC will therefore continue to include sport as a tool and indicator, without creating new structures or new working methods.</p>
<p>With regards to the practical implications of the White Paper on specific EU programmes and their calls for proposals/tenders, the Commission will be supporting social inclusion in and through sport and physical activity actions through a number of instruments available at EU level.</p>
<p>PROGRESS is the EU’s employment and social solidarity programme which started in 2007 and which will run until 2013 covering actions against discrimination, equality between men and women, employment measures and the fight against social exclusion. Ways need to be found under this programme to address the issue of accessibility to sport activities and the specific needs and situation of the vulnerable groups, as well as to take into account the special role that sport can play for disabled persons and the need to ensure gender equality in sport. Another issue to be addressed under this programme is the need to better use the potential of sport as an instrument for social inclusion, including its potential as an employment creation factor, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p>The general call for proposals 2008-2010 in the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme has included physical education and sport among its priorities. This has opened new funding opportunities for sport and physical activity projects to be supported. Promoting participation in educational opportunities through sport is thus a new priority topic for school partnerships supported by the Comenius programme and for thematic networks and mobility in the field of higher education supported by the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p>The Youth in Action Programme acknowledges the vital role that sport plays in young people's physical and social development. This is reflected in a double focus within the Programme on the role of sport as a means to promote healthy lifestyles on the one hand, and social inclusion and active citizenship on the other hand. Since the adoption of the White Paper on Sport, the integration of both dimensions has been strengthened by the addition of specific annual priorities in the Youth in Action Programme Guide, which has the status of a permanent call for proposals and is the main tool to implement the Programme. Consequently, in 2008 priority will be given to youth projects highlighting the role of sport as a tool to promote active citizenship and social inclusion or healthy lifestyles through physical activities among young people.</p>
<p>The Europe for Citizens Programme is open for a large variety of civil society organisations, including those in the area of amateur sport. Since the adoption of the White Paper on Sport, a specific annual priority on sport and active citizenship was added. Consequently, in 2008 priority will be given to applications dealing with the role of sport as a tool to promote active citizenship and social inclusion.</p>
<p>The European Integration Fund is also of relevance. Its main objective is to support the efforts made by Member States in enabling third-country nationals of different economic, social, religious, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds to fulfil conditions of residence and to facilitate their integration in to the European societies. The Integration Fund aims in particular at putting Common Basic Principles (CBP) approved at EU level on integration into practice. One of the CBP affirms that "mainstreaming integration policies and measures in all relevant policy portfolios and levels of government is an important consideration in public-policy formation and implementation" and that "Integration occurs in all spheres of public and private life. Numerous non-governmental actors influence the integration process of immigrants and can have additional value. Examples in this respect are trade unions, businesses, employer organisations, political parties, the media, sports clubs and cultural, social and religious organisations. Cooperation, coordination and communication between all of these actors are important for effective integration policy. The involvement of both immigrant and the other people in the host society is also necessary". Within the framework of the preparatory actions (INTI programme) to the establishment of this Fund, the Commission has co-financed in 2005 a project called "Integration at sports" coordinated by Zeitbild, a German organisation, in partnership with five other organisations from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for the question regarding his concerns that EU funded projects might be connected with the Egyptian satellite provider Nilesat which is broadcasting Al-Manar TV to Europe.</p>
<p>Audiovisual cooperation as provided for in the Action Plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is essentially concerned with upgrading the regulatory framework and therefore cannot be seen as supporting objectionable content directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>There are currently no Commission funded projects in the audiovisual sector in Egypt. EU financial assistance is targeted to support the priorities as set out in the ENP Action Plan. This is clearly reflected in the National Indicative Programme (NIP) which provides € 558 million for the period 2007-2010 to assist Egypt in addressing a number of challenges of its political, economic and social reform agenda and to encourage further reform steps.</p>
<p>Both the NIP and the Annual Action Programmes which define the specific programmes on a yearly basis are prepared according to strict rules and procedures. They need to receive the positive opinion of the EU Member States, and are reviewed by the European Parliament under a scrutiny procedure.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Al-Manar TV can be received in Europe via the Egypt owned satellite provider Nilesat. The Commission fully shares concerns raised on the ground that material broadcast by this channel might amount to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>In the joint Action Plan under the ENP the EU and Egypt agreed to cooperate in the fight against intolerance, discrimination, racism and xenophobia and in the promotion of respect for religions and cultures.</p>
<p>In this context another important priority for action is to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>The appropriate mechanism for raising issues related to the fight against racism and xenophobia with Egypt is the sub-committee on political matters, including human rights, which we hope to convene for the first time in the near future.</p>
<p>Dialogue is by definition a two way process and will allow us to discuss issues of mutual concern both in the EU and in the partner country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Commission informed the honourable Member in its answer to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0051_EN.html">H-0051/08</a>, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published airworthiness directives prescribing corrective measures.</p>
<p>In particular, in October 2007 an airworthiness directive required the inspection of all aircraft of the Dash 8 Q400 type registered in the Member States of the European Union. If analysis of the results of these inspections were to show that other measures were required, the EASA would take the necessary steps.</p>
<p>The EASA has reviewed maintenance procedures in relation to the Dash 8 Q400 and considers them satisfactory. It should nevertheless be noted that the approval of the maintenance programmes of each individual operator is the task of the national authorities which are themselves subject to EASA standardisation inspections.</p>
<p>If it is fully to perform its role, the EASA has to be able to draw on all relevant information in relation to safety, particularly information from occurrence reports and investigation reports. The Commission is promoting the establishment of close cooperation between the EASA and the competent national authorities and intends to place this cooperation on a formal footing when the relevant directives are revised. This kind of cooperation is especially important as not all safety tasks have been fully transferred to the EASA and responsibilities are therefore shared between the EASA and Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Greek Government is planning to install 111 wind generators with a total capacity of 333 MW on the island of Skyros in the prefecture of Evvia in the north central Aegean, thereby creating one of the biggest wind power parks in the world.

<p>In mid-February, the Chairs of the respective negotiating groups on agriculture and on industrial goods ("NAMA") issued new versions of their negotiating texts. Further negotiations have taken place in the meantime, and the Chairs may choose to reflect progress made by issuing further revised texts. World Trade Organisation (WTO) members will then have to decide whether a sound basis to move towards a Ministerial negotiation is in place. Such negotiations will seek to agree on so-called "modalities" for the final stretch of the negotiations. There is some prospect that this Ministerial meeting could be convened in the coming months.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the Commission has sought to engage with third countries, so as to find mutually agreeable solutions. In doing so, the Commission is working strictly within the limits of the mandate given by the Council on the basis of the 2003 Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Although there seems to be growing convergence among the negotiating partners on the treatment of sensitive products, there are still a number of difficult and politically sensitive outstanding issues mostly on market access which are not yet ripe for Ministerial involvement.</p>
<p>The negotiating text on NAMA from February lacked clarity on the contribution of emerging economies. The EU position is that these emerging economies should contribute to creating real new trade opportunities in industrial goods, as specified in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) mandate. This position has been made clear to other WTO Members. As regards specific sectors, the EU has tabled a proposal for a sectoral agreement on textiles (whereby trade in textiles would be further liberalised) and will continue to push hard to target tariff peaks in developed countries and emerging economies.</p>
<p>In the area of services, it will be essential that any WTO Ministerial agrees on the need for an ambitious outcome in this area. In the margins of the WTO Ministerial, a special meeting with key industrial and emerging economies will be held, where these countries will signal in which areas they can make further liberalisation offers ("plurilateral signalling conference"). The results of this Conference will therefore feed into the EC's overall assessment of the balance likely to be achieved across the negotiations as a whole.</p>
<p>Any negotiated outcome which could emerge in the weeks ahead must be comprehensive and cover issues of clear interest to the EU. The ambition in agriculture must be fully matched by the other areas of the negotiations, including NAMA, Services and Rules, as well as Geographical Indications. The Commission will not compromise on this: an overall outcome which would not be balanced would not be acceptable.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0258"></a>

<p>A comprehensive report on the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident, including mortality among emergency workers, the enhanced incidence of thyroid cancers, as well as the estimated possible incidence of other cancers and leukaemia, has been published by World Health Organisation (WHO)<a href="#defann_83_1" name="refann_83_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This report came to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence indicating that there might be decreased fertility in the general population as a direct result of the Chernobyl accident. As regards cardiovascular diseases due to radiation, the above report, while not fully substantiating an increase, could nevertheless not exclude a small effect. In order to try to bring clarity on this topic, the Commission has decided to organise a Scientific Seminar on radiation induced circulatory diseases in November 2008.</p>
<p>The exposure of the EU population from the Chernobyl accident represented a small increase in comparison with that received from natural background radiation. Statistically, it can be postulated that this exposure might lead to an increased incidence of cancer in the population but, any increase (should it occur) would be small in relation to that which could be postulated to arise from natural radiation. Moreover, any increase would be statistically undetectable against the relatively high incidence of cancer in the population from other causes.</p>
<p>Doses to the European population have been estimated and levels of radioactivity in the environment are kept under review on the basis of the information provided by Member States under Article 36 of the EURATOM Treaty.</p>
<p>A substantial programme of research (about € 40 million) on the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident has been supported by the Commission in its Framework Programmes (mainly EURATOM) since 1990. Much of this research was carried out in the first half of the 1990s in collaboration with Belarus, Russian Federation and Ukraine. Currently the research is restricted to a few key issues, in particular the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in the three countries. More generally, the risks from radiation exposures at low doses has been and continues to be the main focus of radiation protection research in past and current EURATOM Research Framework Programmes.</p>
<p>In terms of assistance, the Commission has contributed € 250 million so far to the Shelter Implementation Plan. The Commission has also contributed € 92million to projects for treatment and management of radioactive waste and € 96 million supporting the regulatory authorities in Ukraine to ensure the proper nuclear framework.</p>
<p>The Commission has launched over 100 projects to address the environmental, healthcare and social-economic consequences, with a total contribution of € 60 million. This has included medical effect studies on radiation sickness, eco-system studies, emergency information centres, grants to create employment sources in the effected area, education on radiological culture, farming, improving professional health care, and the CORE programme in Belarus, which supports an integrated approach to the issues of social and economical rehabilitation in a context of radiological contamination</p>
<p>Projects currently being implemented include, a social-economic project, a medical project to improve peri-natal diagnostics and treatments in the Ukrainian provinces affected by the accident, a project with UNICEF to improve the healthcare of children and mothers, and a contribution of € 2.7 million to the UNDP project to “Combat the negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
