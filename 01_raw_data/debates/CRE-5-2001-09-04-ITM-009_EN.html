Indeed, it is the biggest environmental market, accounting each year for around EUR 44 billion and 0.5 to 0.6% of Community GDP. Moreover, companies whose primary activity is waste management employ between 200 000 and 400 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of new initiatives, the Commission is currently in the process of developing several that will highlight the potential of the waste market. First, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme in the waste field; this aims to decouple degeneration of waste from economic growth. It announces that the Commission will come forward with thematic strategies on both the sustainable use of resources and on recycling. This will take a long-term look at both questions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aims of the recycling strategy will be identifying policies and instruments to encourage the creation of markets for recycled materials. Secondly, in addition to the aforementioned thematic strategies, the Commission intends to propose legislative initiatives addressing specific problems such as batteries and packaging waste. Together with legislation on electronic waste and end-of-life vehicles, these initiatives should further boost the waste management markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, following the Gothenburg European Council, the Commission is in the process of preparing a report on how environmental technology can promote growth and employment. This will be presented to next year's spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the integrated product policy will address issues dealing with design, manufacturing, use and disposal across the whole life cycle of a product and will therefore impact upon waste generation. It is a challenge to demonstrate to Europe's young people the potential for new employment opportunities in this market. Certainly, all stakeholders have, at all levels, a role to play. The Commission can play its role by keeping waste management issues high on the Community policy agenda and providing high quality information. However, it is clear that education remains within the competence of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The DVD market is characterised by the existence of two different systems in Europe and in the United States and Japan, with the result that European consumers are unable to purchase DVDs from countries belonging to a different zone, where prices appear to be lower and delivery faster.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification given by large undertakings is that this is a means of protecting themselves against piracy. In my view, however, this is a clear violation of free-market competition rules, to the detriment of European consumers, and I have been informed that the Commission is investigating the matter.</p>

The citizens' complaints related to the fact that DVD prices were significantly higher in the Community than in the United States and that, because of the DVD regional coding system under which the world is divided into six geographic regions, a DVD obtained from the US could not be played on a DVD player sold in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the major film production companies is that the basic purpose of such a regional coding system is to allow them to protect their copyrighted intellectual property and the traditional pattern of releasing their films at different times in different parts of the world, as well as to protect against piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the honourable Member's concerns that the Community's consumers may suffer as a result of the DVD regional coding system. It prevents them from benefiting from a broader choice of DVD titles and potentially cheaper prices. The Commission is therefore investigating whether the DVD regional coding system is compatible with Community competition rules. In this context all aspects relating to the establishment and the ongoing operation of the system are being examined. Having sent requests for information to all companies concerned by the system, the Commission is currently reviewing the first batch of material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first question is rather of a meteorological nature. It would be absurd to deny that it is raining outside. Whether that is tantamount to stating that the summer has ended would perhaps be premature. I have been reliably informed that summers usually end about 21 September and the Commission is still striving to meet a deadline, although I must admit that the case is of such complexity that it will need a thorough investigation by not only the MARKT directorate-general but also by other parts of the Commission. It may not be possible to meet that deadline exactly, but the Member who has just spoken can count on my personal endeavour to adhere to it as closely as possible, since the Commission ought to take a decision one way or another as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second question that was put to me, the Commission has taken cognisance of the most unfortunate failures of the two insurance undertakings that were mentioned. The Member will appreciate that Lloyd's is a unique case. There is no other organisation in the world like it. I would therefore hesitate to create the impression that what happened to the insurance undertakings to which reference was made is of any particular relevance to the case of Lloyd's. My service is looking at the failures of the other two insurance companies. Naturally one is interested. I have tried to follow it in the press although I do not know whether the press reports are exhaustive. The people who help me in insurance undertakings have also taken a close interest, but may I assure the Member that we are fully stretched in looking at the Lloyd's case itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The joint memorandum establishing a framework for cooperation between the framework programme for Community research and the Innovation 2000 initiative from the European Investment Bank is a response to this request. This joint memorandum aims to energise European research and innovation by drawing on existing synergies and developing new ones. It is not, however, an instrument of the framework programme nor one of the Innovation 2000 initiative. The Commission and the European Investment Bank have separate decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts are being made to stimulate public awareness of this joint initiative. I would like to point out, for example, that it has been mentioned on television, in the daily papers and by six press agencies in the days following the signing of the memorandum. In addition to this, the Commission and the European Investment Bank websites are linked and offer information on the memorandum. A didactic guide explaining the sources of finance, whether these are supplementary, sequential or parallel, from the Commission and the European Investment Bank will shortly be available on the Internet. Presentations and workshops are planned for the launch of the next framework programme. Finally, the invitations to tender relating to this programme will draw the attention of candidates to this possibility of supplementary financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also believes that equal access to this finance is crucial. For this reason, assessments will be founded upon a certain number of principles that have been acquired over a long period, to ascertain quality, transparency, equal treatment, impartiality as well as efficiency and speed of implementation. Subsidy requests from the Commission and loans from the European Investment Bank will follow the procedures currently in force. On the one hand, experts from the Commission will carry out an evaluation according to the regulations stated in the framework programme, which are specifically based on scientific quality, innovative nature, added Community value and prospects for economic development. On the other hand, the economists and financial analysts from the European Investment Bank will assess the projects in order to ensure that they fulfil the objectives of the EIB, including those linked to their Community mandate, that they satisfy the criteria of economic and financial viability, especially in terms of the repayment of loans, and finally that they are acceptable in environmental terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The signing of the joint memorandum has already received a favourable response from researchers, universities and entrepreneurs, particularly with regard to venture capital. They recognise the potential of such an agreement and the opportunity it offers in terms of combining Commission financing for integrated projects such as those proposed in the framework programme and loans from the European Investment Bank. This is therefore a complementarity that we have been eager to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the reality on the ground. So, what is happening at the moment? We currently have a framework programme for technological research and development that the Commission has been funding since its adoption by Parliament and the Council. Until now there has been no link between what we do and what the European Investment Bank also does to support loans for innovation and infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective therefore is to establish a link between the two. This idea of mutual recognition should obviously not be a mechanism whose sole purpose is to complicate matters. This is, therefore, why each body upholds its own procedures. We have our own specific procedures for scientific assessment as well as for the framework programme and the European Investment Bank has its own financial and economic criteria. It is true that we are currently, with the European Investment Bank, studying solutions that will hopefully be used in the development of new processes that help innovation and new financing procedures, taking account of experience already gained on the one hand by the framework programme for research, and by the European Investment Bank on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This work is in progress. I cannot foresee what the results will be but I can already tell you that the mechanism has already been implemented at Heidelberg, amongst other places, where a technology transfer centre is to be financed by the European Investment Bank under conditions that are very favourable to this centre, which has chosen to work with the European Investment Bank. This would not have been possible without the privileged contacts that we had in relation to research programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">There are examples, therefore, but a great effort with regard to information and the study of dossiers still needs to be made. I thank you for your question and I hope that it will contribute to the dissemination of this information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the extraordinary and unique efforts of the European Union, which provides approximately half of all public aid to developing countries, the fact remains that in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, over 40% of the population are still living below the poverty line, and world-wide, 800 million people, 200 million of them children, are suffering from chronic malnutrition. Now, almost one year later, what progress would the Commission wish to point to in relation to the worthy objectives set out in the joint statement, and what more does the Commission believe we can do to encourage other countries to follow the EU’s lead and play their part in reducing and eradicating poverty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the EC's own efforts, progress on implementing the poverty focus has been reported through various Commission papers. The Commission is midway through the process of preparing poverty-focussed country-strategy papers for the ACP countries which will implement the Cotonou agreement. Developing countries' own poverty reduction policies are the foundation for these country-strategy papers.</p>
<p class="contents">A working paper of the Commission services has been drafted on measures taken and planned to take forward the poverty focus of the EC's development policy and poverty awareness training has been offered to the Commission's development staff. The communication has been produced showing how the Commission is mainstreaming gender equality in development cooperation. Gender inequality is a significant determinant of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also been made in developing policy coherence for poverty reduction, for example, a communication has been prepared on core labour standards and social development. With respect to other donors, it should be noted that many EU Member States have already made poverty eradication the main objective of their bilateral development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC is explicitly and financially supporting the poverty reduction strategy papers as the main vehicle for ensuring universal and coordinate donor support for efforts by developing countries to eradicate poverty for their populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular contact has been established between the Commission, the IMF and the World Bank and with the UN agencies to coordinate our support for the poverty-reduction strategies of developing countries. We strongly endorse the principle of country ownership of development policies which is intrinsic to this PRSP approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be highlighted that the Commission has contributed to work by the Development Assistance Committee, the DAC of the OECD, to develop policy guidelines for Member countries.

<p class="contents">One of the things I noticed throughout the ACP-EU partnership debate was the lack of emphasis on education. The importance of education cannot be underlined enough.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Child sex tourism</span></p>
<p class="contents">The international organisation, ECPAT, works in conjunction with tour operators to combat child sex tourism. The Commission has hitherto provided a grant covering 60% of the cost of the project but ECPAT has now been notified that this support from the Enterprise DG will be withdrawn as of next year and the organisation has been recommended to apply for funding from other DGs instead.</p>
<p class="contents">The project is the only one of its kind and the Commission's support is fully in line with the Council's 1999 decision on efforts to combat child sex tourism. The Enterprise DG has a responsibility, therefore, to ensure that the ECPAT project continues to receive support from another DG before the support in its present form is withdrawn.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Long-term aid to combat child sex tourism</span></p>
<p class="contents">ECPAT is an organisation working to combat sexual exploitation of children, particularly in countries where European travel companies operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial support which ECPAT receives from the Enterprise DG is reportedly to be withdrawn from next year. During the period that ECPAT has received funding from the Enterprise DG, very important work has been carried out, primarily for the incalculable benefit of an unknown number of children, but also for the travel industry, which has drawn up its own code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission have any idea how the highly important work done by ECPAT can continue to receive EU funding to ensure that forceful measures to combat child sex tourism can also be taken in the future?

I note with satisfaction that the Commission is going to continue to provide ECPAT with resources. Let me just say, however, that the child sex trade has not disappeared just because the newspaper headlines have disappeared. It is therefore incredibly important that the Commission should continue with this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless have a problem with the proposal put to us by Commissioner Nielsen, to the effect that this must all take place via Euroaid. If I have been informed correctly, Euroaid requires that the implementing organisation be an NGO in a developing country. That would rule out ECPAT, which does not carry on its main activities in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has my own country been spared. We have recently received a report from ECPAT, estimating that approximately 400 children in Sweden aged from 4 months to 17 years have been exploited. These are frightening revelations, showing that we cannot withdraw support but must continue to give increased support to these organisations. I therefore take the Commissioner’s words as a promise that this will happen. The organisational form is something to which you will have to attend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Humanitarian aid for children</span></p>
<p class="contents">During the seminar of 1 and 2 March in Norrköping, Commissioner Nielson presented shocking figures on armed conflicts and their impact on children. According to UNICEF estimates, 2 million children were killed over the past decade as a direct or indirect result of armed conflicts, whilst a further 6 million children were left disabled or seriously injured, 1 million were orphaned, 20 million were forced to flee their homes and more than 300 000 were themselves involved in the fighting. According to the Commissioner, these figures are not totally reliable because there is no effective system for recording such data.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office has spent around EUR 40 million on these children since the start of 2000, will the Commission act on the wish expressed by the Commissioner responsible and develop a standardised information system which might be used by those responsible on the spot – peace-keeping troops, staff working for humanitarian organisations, etc. – to gather and record data, which would help to determine the real scale of the problem and deal with it more systematically? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although data is available it is often context-specific, anecdotal or piecemeal. The same consolidated numbers – two million children killed in armed conflict, 300 000 children involved in armed fighting, etc, which were brought to the attention of the international community in the excellent report prepared by Graça Machel back in 1996 are repeatedly invoked without qualification, although they cannot continue to hold true.</p>
<p class="contents">I first highlighted the serious lack of reliable data at my meeting with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr Otunnu, in December 2000. Inspired by the discussion with him I took the opportunity of the seminar organised by the Swedish presidency in Norrköping in March this year to call for increased efforts to improve the knowledge about children in conflict. Since that time ECHO has sought to build momentum for the initiation of a large-scale data collection project. The main purpose of the endeavour is to get an impression of the real scale of the problem because the lack of reliable data is both detrimental to our advocacy efforts and a major obstacle to improving our humanitarian response.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not want to initiate just another project resulting in a report which might never be used. Numerous studies have already been conducted on children in conflict. But, as long as there are no common concepts and common definitions, a complex project seeking to establish hard facts has little chance of succeeding. Therefore, rather than focusing on instant results, we are seeking to build broad international support for a comprehensive initiative on a data collection methodology which will enable comparisons across regions and over time.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, ECHO participated in the seminar in Florence – Filling Knowledge Gaps: a Research Agenda on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children – organised by the office of Mr Otunnu, Unicef and others. The workshop succeeded in establishing a network of researchers from both the north and the south, who are ready to undertake research around four themes, one of which will be data on children affected by armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this initiative, ECHO will continue the cooperation with Unicef. As the UN agency mandated with protecting and assisting children, Unicef has the potential to play a central role in data collection. Therefore the Commission is encouraging Unicef to develop a substantial international data collection project on children in conflict, using Mr Otunnu's research network as a sounding board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ready to make a political as well as a financial commitment to improving the availability of data on children affected by armed conflict as long as any new initiative includes general agreements on definitions, concepts and methodologies for the data collection. The goal is to create a system that enables people working in the field, from all different kinds of organisations, to feed information into a uniform system. This will also have a strong effect on the advocacy work in the countries in conflict because they will know that the numbers, the boys and girls we talk about, the real statistics that emerge from this operation, have been produced on their own home ground and are not something which may or may not be true found in a report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said that often there are no common concepts or common definitions and that often we do not have the support on the ground which we need in order to conduct a proper investigation.

<p class="contents">I also have a second question, which relates to this and the previous debate. Wars do not only kill children; they also leave them orphaned or in poverty, which are traumatic experiences, and there are other aspects and I should like to ask if you are honestly addressing them. For example, we have seen sexual abuse of children by our soldiers, soldiers of the European Union, in Somalia and elsewhere.

Obviously we are being stopped in this effort by those who are causing the problems and who are responsible for the conflicts. The conflicts we are facing today are conflicts where the civil population is not detached from the conflict. On the contrary, they are more than hostages; they are victims. This means that nobody fights an honourable war and the guilt of having abducted children and made them participants in the warfare is psychologically the main reason why it is so difficult to get the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment is difficult, politically, and in every other sense of the word. A free press does not have easy access to the places on the earth where these things happen. Next week I will be in Afghanistan to show our support for the organisations we are funding there and who have volunteers working there.

So far this year, three funding decisions totalling EUR 18.5 million have been adopted. They cater for the most urgent needs of those affected by the conflict, benefiting IDPs and the most vulnerable population in Chechnya as well as Chechen IDPs in Inguchetia and Dagestan.</p>
<p class="contents">This implies that in 2001, EUR 18.5 million of the EUR 25 million originally provided for have already been committed. In order to determine further funding needs this year, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office will undertake another assessment of the humanitarian situation in September and subsequently submit a funding proposal to the Commission. The main objective of this forthcoming decision will be preparation for the winter.</p>
<p class="contents">The geographic scope of the aid activities will be determined as per the identified priority needs. The minimum amount required to this end is currently estimated at around EUR 11.5 million. In 2002, ECHO intends to continue funding operations in line with its humanitarian mandate. Obviously, the scope of ECHO's involvement will depend on the security situation and the humanitarian working conditions. This notably concerns our operations inside Chechnya where things are still very difficult for us and where we are still engaged in a so far unsatisfactory dialogue with the Russian authorities concerning radio communication, access, and working conditions and security in general for the people working for our money there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the outbreak of the conflict in the autumn of 1999, ECHO has allocated a total of EUR 820 000 in humanitarian aid to this beneficiary group. The operations funded focused mostly on basic healthcare. However, given the limited budgetary resources and the increasing humanitarian needs in the northern Caucasus, allocations need to be prioritised.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, so far this year, no funding has been earmarked for Chechen refugees in Georgia. An ECHO assessment to be undertaken in September – the one I spoke about – as well as the further evolution of needs on the ground will determine possible further ECHO assistance in favour of Chechen refugees in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very cautious evaluation, but so far I am confident that the balance of our actions is correct. On the Chechnya situation proper, I am not currently planning any mission there. We are following very closely every activity there. The setting up of an internal office is not considered to be the most efficient way to proceed at this time.

I would react by warning against rushing into the principle of extra-territoriality in our legislation. I have a clear impression of this House's strong opinion concerning the Helms-Burton Act with its extra-territoriality and the problems it creates. It is necessary to approach this with caution.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Sudan, we are following the political situation closely and we are actively participating in the political dialogue between the EU and Sudan that was resumed in November 1999. Despite continued concerns about the human rights situation and the lack of progress in the peace process, the political dialogue is considered to be generally positive and it has been agreed to continue it for another year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports initiatives in favour of human rights in Sudan and is planning a study to prepare a more comprehensive strategy in this area. The Commission is aware that economic issues, like sharing Sudan's oil wealth, play an ever increasing role in the conflict. So one could say that the development of this oil sector has raised the stakes for the peace negotiations. Hopefully it could be turned into an asset for that peace negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the accusations that many people living near the oil concessions have been forced to leave and that they have been exposed to human rights abuses. We believe that there is no doubt that militias armed by the government to protect the oil fields and militias supported by the SPLM are involved in human rights violations. However no accurate independent and objective information is available to confirm a large-scale scorched earth policy organised and implemented by the government.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards a possible investment ban, the Commission doubts the utility of unilateral sanctions as a foreign policy tool. We are convinced that a policy of engagement rather than isolation is the best way to have our concerns heard and expectations met.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as legislation is concerned, the Commission already promotes respect of human rights by EU companies wherever they operate, in particular through the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. This instrument, although not legally binding, entails strong recommendations by 33 governments to their multinational enterprises to operate in a socially responsible manner worldwide. It is clear that this is not the same as what is asked for in the question but having broad international support for these principles is in any case necessary to promote efficiency. I believe this is the best way of proceeding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not see the relevance of this idea of ex-territoriality. We are talking about major European oil companies and they should be held accountable for their activities.

<p class="contents">Major European companies have to be accountable in how they operate in other parts of the world. If there was binding legislation that major European companies had to adhere to, then you would not have the situation we have at present. This does not just concern major oil companies, it also concerns other European multinationals which ignore their responsibilities for human rights, for the environment and for basic civil liberties.

<p class="contents">What I said about the principle of extra-territoriality is right. It is a real problem to legislate here for what is going on in another country. The real problem is that what is legal on paper or in practice in a country like the Sudan can be very different from what we would accept as being legal here. But that difference is part of the reality of our world. So I will stick to my warning against this Parliament following what the American Congress has done with the Cuba problem, seen from their point of view and the Helms-Burton Act, by imposing outside their own principles of jurisdiction. We can agree with them or not, but these principles were only decided on by them. That is the core of the problem.</p>

<p class="contents">A main instrument in the eEurope process is benchmarking. The Commission’s website (at <span class="underline">http://europa.eu.int/information_society/eeurope/benchmarking/index_en.htm</span>) provides a list of the benchmarks to be published by the Commission. In Section 3 of that list is the vitally important matter of unmetered access to the Internet, which has become established in the UK market and hopefully soon across the Union too. Unfortunately, the Commission has not yet provided the benchmarking data for this key indicator.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission now provide this information for the European citizen via its website, giving comparative data on current average retail unmetered prices in the fifteen Member States, as well as the unmetered wholesale products available from incumbent operators? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this the Internal Market Council in November last year endorsed a set of indicators to benchmark the year of action plan, which included the cost of access. When defining the access price indicator, the Council specified the source to be OECD, supplemented if necessary by a Commission study. The advantage of the OECD data was that it enabled comparisons to be made with third countries and especially the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">OECD data was used in the Commission's report to the Stockholm European Council. The data includes unmetered access, however their methodology considers only prices charged by the dominant telecom operating in each country. In practice, this meant that there were too few figures available to merit their inclusion in the website. To overcome this methodology, the Commission called for tender for studies to measure Internet access prices in the EU. The response was good and price data will be measured on 1 November 2001 and made available to the Commission not later than 15 January 2002. It should then be repeated half a year later. All the research will be published by a benchmarking section of the e-Europe website.</p>
<p class="contents">Although OECD analysis is limited, it gives an indication of the impact of unmetered access on the price of the Internet. The cost in September 2000 of unmetered access in the OECD report was – and here we use dollars because they use dollars, next year we will use euros – USD 25 in the UK, USD 35 in Spain and USD 50 in Germany. New figures from August 2001 show no notable variation in unmetered access prices. The USA remains at the lower end with USD 20. It is also clear from the benchmarking exercise, that unmetered access is growing rapidly in the EU. For example, provisional data from the Internet use survey shows that in June the proportion of households with unmetered ADSL access has increased by over 200% from last October's survey. The overall penetration of ADSL remains low, that is a fact, but there have been several spectacular advances in Member States, for example, Belgium went from 1% to 11% in the eight months separating the two surveys. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: High-speed tyres in Sweden</span></p>
<p class="contents">In April this year, when many car owners in Sweden were about to buy new summer tyres, an absurd situation arose. The tyre industry claimed that an EU directive stipulated that every new car must be equipped with tyres capable of coping with the vehicle's theoretical top speed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the maximum speed limit in Sweden is 110 kph was not relevant and many cars had to be fitted with tyres capable of coping with speeds of 270 kph and in some cases as much as 300 kph.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the risk of fines and the new registration test, it is common for car owners to ignore the high-speed tyre requirement. Many tyre dealers have pre-printed forms for customers to sign releasing the dealer from liability for fitting tyres which can only withstand speeds up to 190 kph.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this interpretation of the directive correct, and does the individual car owner have the right to ask for tyres to be fitted to the vehicle which are not capable of coping with the its theoretical top speed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European legislation on type approval of motor vehicles stipulates that every new car must be equipped with a certain category of tyres specified by the manufacturer of the vehicle and capable of coping with the vehicle top speed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this directive governs solely the initial entry into service of the car before its registration in the fleet of one Member State. No indication is given concerning the use of the vehicle, including for the aspects relating to the top speed of replacement tyres. Another piece of legislation – Directive 1999/37/EEC on the minimum set of information to be put on registration papers for motor vehicles – does not include any specification for this characteristic of replacement tyres. Therefore the interpretation by the tyre industry and distributors in Sweden of the relevant EC legislation is correct. However, the fact that at European level no specific prescription is given does not automatically allow car owners to replace the tyres with the model they wish.</p>
<p class="contents">At national level and according to the principle of subsidiarity, the police and judicial authorities of the Member States have responsibility for enforcement of the relevant road safety provisions and the imposition of corresponding sanctions when needed. In principle, fitting a car with tyres not capable of coping with its top speed could invalidate the conformity of the vehicle with the EU type approval. This potentially dangerous situation could be penalised by the police, if it is in contradiction to national legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Sweden, the maximum speed is 110 km/h, but now many Swedes have to have tyres that can cope with speeds of up to 250 km/h.

Even though in Sweden the speed limit is 110 to 120, tyres are expected to cope with higher speed limits because, if a Swedish car goes over the bridge to Denmark and from Denmark to Germany where there are no speed limits on motorways, they will be travelling at higher speeds. The same security should be guaranteed throughout Europe. I will come back to the honourable Member of Parliament on the first question as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to discuss these questions the Commission issued a communication, on 11 July 2001 on the protection of pedestrians. It is important to remember the significance of this topic. Each year, 9 000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed, and 200 000 are injured, in accidents involving a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">The European motor industry has now, after discussions held with the Commission, made a commitment to incorporate a raft of safety features from 2002 onwards. These aim at improving pedestrian safety in accident situations. As to how regulation is to be implemented, there is a choice between, on the one hand, a voluntary agreement of the industry based on agreed objectives and, on the other hand, the conventional legislative route. In July, the Commission found that the content of the industry's commitment matched the objectives set by the Commission. The final decision on whether the safety standards will be implemented by a commitment – which will be closely monitored – or by legislation, will be made by the end of the year. According to the agreement, the car manufacturers promise to ensure that all new passenger cars will go through a series of tests with the purpose of ensuring that the cars are designed in such a way that pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in an accident will suffer as little injury as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions which have taken place with the Association of European Car Manufacturers on the commitment of the industry have been based on the following objectives: first of all, attaining the objectives proposed by the EEVC committee which deals with the improvement of European vehicle safety; secondly, implementing measures to improve the safety of pedestrians in the short and medium term; thirdly, adopting new and improved technology which will effectively improve the safety of pedestrians; and fourthly, finding an innovative solution in which passive and active safety features will be combined. The objective of the commitment is a reduction in the number of fatalities and also a reduction in the number and seriousness of injuries. It is estimated that the annual number of deaths would be cut by two thousand if all motor vehicles on the roads of the European Union met the requirements of the EEVC tests. This reduction would represent 20 percent of the present level. Thanks to new technology, deaths could be reduced even further.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission decides to propose legislation, this would be based on the content of the commitment. The industry is making a commitment that as from 1 July 2005 all new types of vehicles will meet requirements which relate to the first series of passive measures recommended by the joint (that is, the Commission's joint) research centre. The improvements will be added to the existing models in stages, with the result that these will be included in the features of all new vehicles by 2012. In the next stage, the manufacturers will commit to installing other safety equipment. This means that from 2010 onwards the objectives set by EEVC will finally be attained, either in accordance with EEVC's technical proposals or by other measures which will have an impact on safety at least equal to this. As one example we can mention that from the beginning of next year all new cars will be fitted with day running lights, and inflexible "bull bars" will be banned. From 2003 onwards, all new vehicles would be fitted with anti-blocking brakes. The Japanese car manufacturers, who are represented by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association JAMA, expressed their official approval of the matter by making an identical commitment in July. The ASCEA and JAMA commitments cover over 95 percent of the market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the EU. Negotiations concerning similar commitments are underway with the South Korean car manufacturers, which would lead to almost one hundred percent coverage. As the honourable Member is aware, the Commission has sent the commitment which was approved in July to the European Parliament and Council for comment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the question, above all, was whether the Commission will issue a Directive proposal on the matter, or whether it is prepared to make an agreement with the car manufacturers. Is the reply of the Commissioner to be interpreted as meaning that, at some stage, the idea will come to predominate within the Commission that the quickest results can be obtained by making an agreement with the car manufacturers, in other words that the preferred line of action will be to follow this procedure rather than enacting a Directive on the matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to avoid a possible misunderstanding the Commission will have to point out that it has not launched an inquiry into the Europol-related matter to which the honourable Member refers. As far as the Commission is aware the matter concerns accusations of fraud unrelated to the Sensus contract. The Commission understands that internal investigations by Europol have led to the Dutch judicial authorities now investigating the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the action the Commission has undertaken concerning the Sensus project is concerned, the Commission has initiated an internal review of the management of this project as indicated in the Commission's reply to the oral questions by the honourable Member. Following this review and also on the basis of ongoing, more general recommendations, both from the Court of Auditors and the external monitoring panel of the Information Society Technologies programme, the Commission is implementing changes in procedures which will ensure significant improvements in project management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attends the meetings of the management board of Europol and meetings of the heads of national units in an observer capacity. It has no mandate to investigate Europol other than in the context of direct contractor relations such as through the Sensus project. In the context of Sensus and as explained in the replies to written questions, the Commission is not currently planning a financial audit of Europol's participation in Sensus. But the need for such an audit will be assessed again when all the cost claims related to Sensus have been submitted by project participants. That should happen in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Sensus and Aventinus were involved in pre-competitive research using many basic technologies for the production of a demonstrator. The objective was to overcome linguistic barriers between European law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime such as drugs smuggling and illegal immigration. Sensus is an assembly of software models including linguistic content, utilisation and report generation, workflow and database management systems. There is therefore no specific basic technology.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information received by the Commission, although Polygon was originally intended to be used in Sensus, in the autumn of 1999 a different technology was selected instead. The Commission service has been assured by the contractors that Polygon is not a component of the Sensus demonstrator. The coordinator of the Aventinus projects has confirmed that Polygon was not used in either Aventinus I or Aventinus II.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as technologies used in Europolis and Eurint systems are concerned, the Commission is not in a position to address the question of the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Still, I am very troubled, Commissioner. I have the feeling that in the light of what is happening at the moment at Europol, there is insufficient monitoring, and that in some way or other we shall have to design a system at European level for monitoring Europol more effectively. I know that the present OLAF Regulation is not sufficient for this. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to investigate possible proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">A second supplementary question concerns the coordinator of the Sensus programme. We all know that he is an agent of the German secret service. The man was sentenced at the end of last year for forging documents. I should like to know from the Commissioner, since we do not yet know from previous answers, whether or not the man is still co-ordinating the SENSUS programme. If that is not the case, I should like him to inform us who is coordinating the Sensus programme. I thank the Commissioner for his answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed I believe it to be even more pertinent for at least two reasons: development of the ESDP – European Security and Defence Policy – and the constitution of transnational defence companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now the Council discussions have been characterised by differences of opinion between the Member States, preventing the adoption of a common position on the framing of a European armament policy. But as the competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to the credibility of the nascent European Security and Defence Policy, the Commission expects that governments will recognise increasingly the urgency for a change in attitudes in order to end policies and practices that prevent European defence companies from working together more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a change in the position of Member States will allow the Commission to contribute more effectively to the creation of a European defence equipment market through exercising its competence under Community policies such as the creation of the single market in defence, external trade, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">As the commissioner for enterprise I am pursuing the objective of promoting greater competitiveness of Europe's defence industry in close cooperation with national authorities and industry representatives. One important initiative in that context is our efforts aimed at promoting awareness of the importance of standardisation issues for the efficiency and competitiveness of the European defence industries and to investigate options and possible start-up actions for defence standards reform.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues were fully explored at an important conference last autumn, attended by the principal interested partners. On that occasion the European Standardisation Organisation, CEN, was identified as the ideal forum to implement this effort in the form of a handbook of defence standards and defence procedures which, when in place, will offer more transparency, improving interoperability, harmonisation of requirements and cost efficiency in procurement. This process is now well under way.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the industry itself, there has been a huge transformation of the defence industrial landscape, particularly in the Eurospace and electronic sectors. Good progress has also been made in the land armament and naval sectors. It is to be expected that once this transformation has been completed and fully implemented the industry will formulate new expectations as regards access to defence markets in Europe and abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">To allow the necessary time to formulate these positions it has been agreed that the planned meeting of defence industry COs with commissioners concerned should take place by the end of the year, preferably now in the early autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
