<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I am speaking here not only as the rapporteur but also in my capacity as the spokesman of the European People’s Party, but first of all as the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I earlier appealed to you all to discuss Eurodac and to vote on it today, because Eurodac is a system that finally enables us to implement the Dublin Convention. In this Dublin Convention, that was concluded in 1990, the responsibility is established of a Member State’s competence to deal with an asylum procedure – according to this agreement, the State responsible is the one in which a refugee first finds safe haven. Up to now control has not been possible because it has not been possible clearly to define a person’s identity. In Eurodac, almost ten years later, we have an instrument that makes possible the clear identification of asylum-seekers and also of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">What is its purpose? The aim of Eurodac is to help implement what was agreed in Dublin. The aim of Eurodac is to establish once and for all which Member State is responsible for the asylum procedure. The aim of Eurodac is to prevent multiple applications and thereby also to stop social abuse and indirectly it has the effect of sharing the burden. And that too is something quite essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore under Eurodac, every Member State is bound to take the fingerprints of all asylum-seekers, all illegal immigrants who are picked up at the border in order to compare whether an application for asylum has already been submitted anywhere else. The Member States also have the opportunity of fingerprinting illegal immigrants who are found in the Member State itself for the purpose of comparison.</p>
<p class="contents">In the discussion, that was very long, very good and very pragmatic, a solution was also reached. On the vote in the Committee on the Eurodac system there was full agreement, only the Group of the Greens was against the system as a whole and introduced proposals for amendment that were such as to completely destroy the Eurodac system. They were rejected. There was also full agreement with the Social Democrats on the system, which we were pleased about. There were proposals for amendment, which aimed to raise the age from 14 to 18 and early cancellation was planned if refugee status was attained. There was a majority here, which was against my opinion as the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The report as a whole was deemed positive and was adopted in plenary session. That is, in the view of the Committee, with the full support of the Social Democrats as well, in Eurodac we have an instrument for an orderly asylum procedure in Europe and for combating abuse. That is all I wish to say with regard to my function as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I will speak in my capacity as the EPP spokesman as well. I am against political groupings always trying to present Eurodac as a system that does not help this monitoring, but is a form of criminalisation because fingerprints are taken. It is not a matter of criminalising somebody, but giving the Member States the responsibility, giving them the duty of dealing with the asylum procedure and also of protecting young people when fingerprints are taken from the age of 14. Because only if we know that they are this age do they of course fall under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or under the Hague Convention and under the protective measures of the Member States. It therefore has a protective function if we also take the fingerprints of young people and this is in full accord with all the Conventions that we possess.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens are against the system and I think that they are simply refusing to face up to reality! They will bear the full responsibility if this system and a proper asylum policy for Europe fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something else, that I consider to be especially important. I have received from Minister Schily – he is the Minister of the Interior in Germany and a Social Democrat – an urgent plea and an appeal for this Eurodac system to become a reality, with which he went against his own Social Democrats here in the House and against all the others who are attempting not to accept this system. It is remarkable when one is asked as a Christian Democrat to undertake something here against the Left in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the Eurodac system. I am most fervently in favour of it because it takes us towards achieving a common asylum policy for Europe and the Member States are at their wits end over this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have here a system against asylum abuse, against illegal immigration. If the Social Democrats and the Greens vote against Eurodac, then they will bear full responsibility if there is further asylum abuse and illegal immigration.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, there are days when it seems easy to do one’s job and other days when it is difficult to do one’s job. For me, today is one of the latter, a day on which we have difficult problems to resolve. These problems are of two kinds. There is a political problem to settle and that is the matter of how are we going to proceed with the fingerprinting system for asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants or those staying illegally, as they are described by the Council and the European Union authorities, and how are we going to proceed with the controversial arguments of our colleague Mr Pirker? I shall begin with the latter, because it is logically more fun to discuss politics in Parliament than on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">If anyone should take the blame here for the fact that we are finding it so hard to find common ground, then it is the rapporteur. You, Mr Pirker, with your proposals for amendments, have from the beginning endeavoured to aggravate the work that the Council has submitted to us, which is already highly controversial. We cannot hold that against you, it is your political right, but you must be aware that the Left in this House cannot support the restrictive measures, that as a conservative Austrian, you wish to pursue!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I should like to make here is that when you express regret about the poor Social Democrats and the contradictions between them and the German government, the whole story should be told. Mr Schily wrote you a letter that he also sent to Mr Nassauer and myself. In his letter, Mr Schily referred to the difficulties that we as Social Democrats have picked as a central theme in this consultation procedure and gave his opinion from his point of view as the German Minister of the Interior. This letter arrived in the last few days and it gave rise to a lively debate in the Social Democratic Group that led to us asking you to give us a little more time so that we can finish discussing this controversial subject, in order then to attempt to work with you by consensus. I discussed this with you yesterday evening at 10 p.m., but we know your position and what you will say: We have the majority here, we will get it through and anyone who is not with us is actually refusing to face up to reality – as you put it so well yourself!</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the way to create a reasonable asylum policy in the European Union! It must be built on a broad consensus and not on exclusion and confrontation, as you seem to wish. What is our problem? The Council has said, and there is some understanding in our Group for this, that we need to extend the registration system for asylum-seekers to other target groups and you have used perfectly good arguments that we also appreciate. For example, the system should afford protection to minors, who are smuggled in illegally and who are here forced into prostitution, amongst other things. This kind of fingerprinting system can be seen as giving them a certain police and state protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is a constitutional one. Should we not separate those people who, as political victims of persecution claim a basic right to which they are entitled, i.e. protection from this persecution, from those who have, for example, entered a country illegally or who have smuggled people in, or from those who have been smuggled in against their will? Should we not separate this group of people? Because we believe that this discussion is not yet at an end and because we also wish to discuss the subject again with Minister Schily, we have asked you to wait a fortnight. What if you now say, a year has gone by, for goodness sake, and we cannot wait another fortnight, Mr Pirker!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So I must say to you that the method you are using is intensifying the debate in this House. That is not a good thing! I will say to you now – trusting in the liberality of the Liberal Group -, that with this strategy you will fail in the long term! For today you have again been lucky, but in the long term this exclusion method will not be successful. We are not against Eurodac, in principle, but we would have liked more time for consultation. You did not want to give it to us. You alone are responsible for this impasse!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Liberals in this House have a number of concerns about the draft protocol that was put forward in this draft regulation. It carries a risk that it may blur the distinction between asylum-seekers and other types of immigrants. It carries the risk that it may diminish the protection of those who need it by mistakenly channelling them through normal immigration procedures rather than asylum procedures. There are certain “legal grey areas”. The extension of EURODAC to persons who are not seeking asylum is, conceivably, outside the competence of the Dublin Convention, for example. There is the risk that this protocol, this regulation, may be unworkable. Member States will have little incentive to fingerprint third country nationals whom they find illegally on their territory, if there is a risk that they may become responsible for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a certain lack of clarity in some of the definitions used, like 'irregular crossing', 'illegally present' and so on. Nonetheless, we believe that the debates in this House, in our committee, have been such that we have a good report drawn up here with the support of most political groups and I congratulate the rapporteur on it. The Liberal Democrats will support this report. We will not support amendments 13 to 20: although we share concerns about finger-printing, we believe that the attempt to stop a register being created will fail to deal in realistic terms with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one thing to Mr Schulz who raised the question of liberality. This is a time for cool heads and good argument. Mr Schulz cannot deny that we face a challenge in the Union with the number of people illegally present. We have to find a way of tackling that problem while at the same time protecting civil liberties. We believe that this report achieves that, and that is why we will be happy to give it our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are quite a few reservations and observations with regard to this report, including its lack of a social and human dimension. Many police staff and criminal investigation services will of course welcome this report with open arms as it simplifies their work. We need to be realistic and we do not deny that there is abuse. Neither would I wish to see the Greens held responsible for the organised crime in this world, as people will shortly be saying we are responsible because we are unwilling to do anything about it. This is untrue.</p>
<p class="contents">A house is built on solid foundations. This report hardly constitutes a foundation, in fact, it is even a little reprehensible, in my opinion, although the amendments submitted make it more acceptable and tone it down somewhat. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that asylum seekers look for safety, need a roof over their head and money to buy food. The proposal’s point of departure is that asylum seekers are actually suspects. It is assumed that they abuse the right of asylum. And this is not proper. Asylum seekers are criminalised here but they are not criminals. Applicants are having a criminal role forced upon them, but are, in actual fact, victims, victims of the situation in their country of origin. </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to minimum standards: a control policy as proposed is only acceptable if minimum standards apply across all states with regard to the handling of asylum applications. Applications should be dealt with correctly and uniformly wherever they are submitted. The gap is still too wide at the moment. Needless to say, someone will apply for asylum where he hopes he will find recognition, a listening ear and humane treatment. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to touch upon protective measures for personal data. These measures do not apply to refugees at the moment. This discrimination also promotes criminalisation. Within our Green group, a discussion has been opened on the principle of fingerprinting in general. When investigations are undertaken into organised crime, it is necessary to be completely clear on people’s identity in order to track down the criminals and for the benefit of the victims. Every effort must be made to stop organised crime in its tracks. Fingerprinting can help us achieve this. Asylum seekers look for safety and a sense of security and do not wish their name to be on display across Europe. Maybe in future, a debate could take place on the role of fingerprinting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now being proposed that illegal immigrants as young as 14 years of age should also be covered by the arrangements in question, while the Dublin Convention is concerned only with asylum-seekers. In our view, Eurodac is not a prerequisite for enabling the Dublin Convention to function. It just gives the authorities increased opportunities for exercising control and, in any state based on the rule of law, very serious attention must necessarily be given to the balance between control measures and the rights of the individual. This is absolutely crucial. So let it be stated immediately that our Group is opposed to Eurodac. We hope that Parliament will again dig in its heels over this frontal assault on the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as on the legal rights of third-country nationals within the borders of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Taking fingerprints from people, just because they are not citizens of a Member State, is tantamount to wholesale criminalisation of foreign nationals. To mix immigrants and asylum-seekers together in a fingerprint register is a departure from the basic idea of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Asylum-seekers are entitled to ask for protection. It is not a criminal offence to request asylum. And the Dublin Convention in fact relates only to the first country of refuge. </p>
<p class="contents">If a fingerprint register is to be established, we do not under any circumstances want asylum-seekers to be mixed together with either legal or illegal immigrants, and we want to propose that, under such a system, fingerprints are taken only from people who have been sentenced for having committed criminal acts. It is proposed that 14 year-olds should have their fingerprints taken and stored in a register. We think that this is a departure from the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which requires that we protect children and which recommends 18 years as the age at which, generally, a child is deemed to become an adult. If a register is to be established, we want it to be possible to take fingerprints only from people of 18 years of age and over. Fingerprints are something which you take from criminals, and even criminals are entitled to protection. The rules on the erasure of records and the disclosure of information are far too vague in the Council’s proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">If a register is to be established, we propose that it should be possible for a person’s records to be erased as soon as that person has received a residence permit from a Member State. Let me repeat this once more: we are opposed to Eurodac. We consider this proposal to be a huge boulder in the wall around Fortress Europe, a wall we want to see broken down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have two points to make. First of all, I have some questions for the Commissioner. It is, of course, evident from Protocol No 5 to the Amsterdam Treaty on the position of Denmark, that Title IV of the Treaty does not apply to Denmark, but this is not apparent from the proposed regulation. I should like to see this matter clarified and would ask that the clarification be included in the proposal. Next, I should like to ask the Commissioner if this is to be viewed in connection with what is dealt with in Article 5 of the Protocol I mentioned, namely a decision to build upon the Schengen acquis. If so, there is a definite procedure for how Denmark is to be incorporated into the system. Is it this rule which is to be followed, or others? And finally: if it is this rule or other rules which are to be followed, what would be the consequences of a Danish accession? Is it the case that decisions by the EU authorities, including the European Court of Justice, are binding upon Denmark? </p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the fundamental and most important one. As Pernille Frahm rightly said, this proposal concerns an extension to Fortress Europe. It is an effective defence mechanism, and what is being put in place is a complete and consistent absence of legal rights for one large group of people, namely asylum seekers, and for a group of other foreigners without, moreover, there being the right to differentiate between them. There are no elementary rules concerning legal rights in connection with the registration procedure and in connection with the right to pass on this information held by the Member States and the Commission. I want to say that this is the most repressive system we have experienced in Europe in this century, at any rate in the perspective of the Nordic legal tradition, and we have had our share of repressive systems. And what is interesting and sinister is that it is wrapped up in phraseology which would have made the late propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, turn green with envy. Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that this total absence of legal rights is to be established by virtue of conditions in the Treaty which concern and proclaim an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and which guarantee freedom of movement. What, in fact, we are dealing with here is the very opposite and, to crown it all, Mr Pirker’s report also attaches importance – and this is the only real amendment proposed – to replacing the concept of a foreigner with that of a citizen of a third country. Is the reason for this that the concept of a foreigner has negative connotations? What the realities of the situation are is not so important. What is important is the packaging. You are welcome to it, is what I say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore give our full support to the Eurodac database for fingerprinting being set up. We will gladly approve the Pirker report and I would ask the rapporteur to consider the criticism that follows as minor criticism of an otherwise sound report which represents a good step in the right direction. After all, it must be clear that the Eurodac database should not just serve the purpose of establishing which Member State might deal with a particular asylum seeker’s case, but rather it should make it more difficult or impossible to abuse the asylum system in the future. I therefore regret that Parliament has further mitigated the already weakened and moderate Council proposals in its various amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely beyond me why both the Council and Parliament are still a great deal laxer on illegal immigrants than on alleged asylum seekers. After all, the fingerprints of illegal immigrants may not be kept ten but two years, may not be compared with each other – one wonders why – and may only be used for comparison with new asylum applications within the two-year period. I fear that this illustrates that, according to some, the Eurodac system should serve, perhaps not exclusively but largely, at any rate, to assign a particular Member State the responsibility of footing the bill for a certain level of illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system, rather than to render such abuses completely impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would put a big question mark over the fact that it appears that some sort of office of the European Commission will manage the system. In my opinion, it should be assigned to a European police body such as Europol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And while there are plenary sittings and meetings under way at the same time, it would be a good thing if all the rooms had screens, if that is not too much trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our Group has significant doubts, and reasonable doubts, in relation to the EURODAC report presented. We have already rejected a report which intended, in unclear terms, and for who knows what reason, to take the fingerprints of the illegal immigrants who arrive in the European Union. We have a new proposal, this time from the Commission, which makes important advances.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal says that the fingerprints of illegal immigrants – because we are talking about the extension of the existing EURODAC programme to illegal immigrants – will only be taken in application of the Dublin Asylum Convention, that is to say, only in order to find out whether these immigrants have asked for asylum in another Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not opposed to this idea, on the contrary, we are not against clarifying whether there is a Member State responsible for the handling of the case if it is shown that a person has already applied for asylum. But we have many doubts about this massive taking of fingerprints – because we believe it will be massive – of people who have crossed borders illegally or who are in an illegal situation in a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we believe that a little more time is needed to carry out the proposed extension of the EURODAC system.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are clear about is that it is not acceptable to apply it to minors. In this respect we will stand firm. We will demand that this system be applied only to adults, because minors require other legal provisions if they are not accompanied. And if they are with their family, that family will enter the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is basically criminalising victims, people who are seeking asylum and refuge. Instead, our priority should be to improve the situation of asylum-seekers in the Member States. In my own country at the moment the situation for asylum-seekers is completely intolerable. Just this week the Minister for Justice has announced that he is going to prosecute taxi drivers who carry illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically what we are doing is promoting the whole attitude of xenophobia and victimising people who are already victims. The report tries to make the protocol sound less threatening, but the principle is exactly the same. We are criminalising victims. Fingerprinting is something that is normally done to suspected criminals. Suspected criminals at least have the advantage that they will have legal representation, they will know their rights. These people will not know their rights, not have legal representation. The protocol does not explain where and how fingerprinting will be done. Will it be on entry into the country, before the border is crossed? If this is the case does that mean that anyone, anywhere, can be stopped?</p>
<p class="contents">This is basically in line with the Dublin Convention. It was something set up in secret, behind closed doors, unfortunately in my own country – which I am very sorry about. It basically promotes the whole idea of a fortress Europe, keeping out the so-called undesirables, whereas we should be looking at why people are seeking asylum, not victimising them. One of the improvements aimed at here is on age. The idea is that fingerprinting 14-year-old children is completely unacceptable. But even at the age of 18 or 21 it is still unacceptable because these people are not criminals. You are making the assumption they are. The whole principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to have been done away with here. The attitude within the European Union towards asylum-seekers has to change. What we are doing is encouraging the xenophobia that is growing throughout the Member States of the European Union. That is a tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It calls into question the inviolability of the documents held by the bodies responsible for handling asylum requests. It contravenes the legal protection to which refugees are entitled.

<p class="contents">Who here would dare take the fingerprints of a fourteen year-old kid? The Eurodac project makes criminals of the immigrants who find themselves without proper papers, without status, often because of the diversity of laws between countries. Basically, it contravenes all international conventions for the protection of human rights. With this, fortress Europe is committing the crime of failing to assist refugees in danger. Is this so surprising for a liberal Europe which arms the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters, while at the same time rejecting Kurdish refugees?

The assertion that we are adopting a restrictive position on asylum, of which the rapporteur was also accused today is simply wrong. Our position is quite clear. Although it is not necessary to mention it, I should nevertheless like to say to all those who agree with the criticism without knowing the position, that of course our policy is based on the Geneva Convention relating to Refugees. Of course we consider it absolutely necessary to provide temporary protection for displaced persons. Anyone who needs protection should be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do say, however, is that the unsuitable migration policy has led to social problems in conurbations, which we as serious politicians should not ignore. This criticism must be permitted in a democratic structure. Because we consider that a fair sharing of the burden is an important aspect of asylum policy, we are also in favour of introducing all relevant measures just as for the Dublin Convention and Eurodac.

(PSE).</span></span>   – The rapporteur in his introduction said that the objective is to implement the Dublin Convention and have a system of fingerprinting. My group agrees in principle with that, but we want some safeguards. Mr Pirker also said that the purpose was to ensure that there are no social abuses of the system. Again, my group would agree with that, but we want to make certain of this, which is why safeguards are necessary to ensure that there are no abuses by the authorities either.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are some on the right of this House who wish to muddy the waters and to draw no distinction between asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, third country nationals. I shy away from the use of the word 'foreigners', or indeed the word that was used in the translation of the English text. In English 'aliens' are people from another planet and to be perfectly honest we do not have much of a problem with that at the moment. There seem to be, though, Members of this House who have no sympathy with either group – and if there were aliens from another planet, they would probably have little sympathy with them either. The safeguards and the amendments that we are asking for are designed to ensure that any data collected is processed properly and that where people are granted asylum or achieve legitimate status the data collected is deleted. On the age limit, it is sometimes very difficult to tell the age of a young person, but there seems to be a consensus that 18 is a fair compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McKenna in her impassioned speech a few moments ago said that we must ensure that asylum seekers and others are not treated as criminals. Certainly we want to ensure that this new system is used to assist the most vulnerable in our society. I accept, as I am sure we all must do, that people do not leave their homes and families and travel half-way across Europe thousands of miles away for no reason at all. They do not do just it on a whim, they do it for a real reason and we must accept and respect the fact that they need support and they need help and assistance. I hope – and I am sure the Commissioner is listening – we can make certain that when this system comes into full operation, it is used positively, humanely and with considerable compassion to help and support the most vulnerable in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – First of all, I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission, the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin Convention which determines which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States. The Tampere European Council has called for work on EURODAC to be concluded rapidly, and the Commission considers in fact that EURODAC is an important instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">If governments and citizens can be confident that we have effective arrangements in place to decide which state is responsible for considering an asylum claim and to tackle the problem of multiple asylum applications, it will make easier our task of promoting high and fair standards of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the EURODAC Regulation has been adopted, it will be incumbent upon the Council to make similar progress in respect of other asylum instruments. I, myself, will shortly unveil a proposal for a legal basis for the European Fund for Refugees. This will provide financial assistance from the Community budget for the reception, the integration and the voluntary return of refugees, displaced persons and asylum-seekers which is a relevant instrument to give a human dimension to the asylum policy of the Union, as one Member of the House requested just a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also be unveiling a proposal for an instrument on asylum procedures after we have received the opinion of Parliament on our working document towards common standards on asylum procedures. I shall also unveil a new proposal on temporary protection which will draw on our experiences during the Kosovo crisis. Progress on the EURODAC Regulation must be accompanied by real progress in other areas so that we can gradually attain our goal of creating a common European asylum system. A proposal which provides for the systematic fingerprinting of asylum seekers and certain other categories of third country nationals clearly raises sensitive and difficult issues. We therefore need to ensure the highest standards of fairness and transparency for all those affected by the regulation. In particular the most rigorous of data protection standards are required.</p>
<p class="contents">When we converted the EURODAC Convention and Protocol into a Community Regulation, we amended it to bring it fully into line with Community law on data protection including the new Treaty Article 286 on data protection arrangements for the Community Institutions. It is up to the authority provided for in Article 286 to ensure the appropriate and adequate use of these data and the application of Community rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We also introduced new provisions on monitoring and evaluation under which the Commission will report regularly to the Parliament and to the Council on the concrete functioning of EURODAC.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Committee on Citizens' Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and to their rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report on the EURODAC Regulation. The report contains a number of useful amendments which I believe will help us to improve the text of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept amendment No 1 to avoid the term 'alien' and instead refer to third country nationals, although we will have to make it clear that the Regulation also covers stateless persons. We can also accept amendment No 2 to the title which introduces a reference to the Dublin Convention. We can also accept the principle of amendment No 6 which makes it clear that there is only a match if fingerprints are identical and not if they are just similar, and we accept also the principle of amendment No 12 which is intended to make it clear that data must never be sent to an asylum applicant's country of origin or used within a Member State for an unrelated purpose. I take this opportunity to assure Mrs Terrón i Cusí that illegal immigrants' fingerprints are only used for the specific purpose of the Dublin Convention – which means for analysis – if they have requested a demand for asylum in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The two issues which have been of most concern to the Parliament are the minimum age-limit for fingerprinting and the rules on erasure of data from the central database.</p>
<p class="contents">On the minimum age-limit my approach is to stick to the compromise minimum age-limit of 14 years which was agreed in previous negotiations, but to accept your amendment which makes it clear that fingerprinting must be carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="contents">Migratory movements of people seeking protection unfortunately involve minors. We need to ensure that our arrangements for determining responsibility for asylum applications take account of this reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the age-limit of 14 years was a compromise reached after difficult negotiations. I do not want to reopen the discussion and risk ending up with an even less acceptable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rules on erasure of data are concerned, the amendments approved by the Committee on Citizens' Rights provide for the erasure of data as soon as anyone covered by the regulation has obtained legal status. I can accept this in relation to people who are apprehended irregularly crossing the external border of the European Union and who are fingerprinted under Article 8 of the regulation. Indeed, the intention behind the current text is that this data should be erased as soon as the person concerned obtains any kind of residence permit. This would include someone who has been admitted as a refugee or under a subsidiary form of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot go that far in relation to data on asylum applicants, but I can accept some of the amendments that have been put forward. If we were to erase all data on asylum applicants as soon as they were granted any kind of legal status, EURODAC would no longer cover situations where an asylum applicant is granted permission to remain in some other capacity for a short time and, at the end of this period, moves to another Member State and claims asylum there. But I can accept the amendment which provides that data on asylum applicants should be erased when the person concerned is recognised as a refugee.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States consider that a problem arises if people who have been recognised as a refugee in one Member State travel to another Member State and claim asylum there. They have therefore argued that data on recognised refugees should be blocked in the central unit so that statistical data can be compiled to measure the scale of the phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should take a different approach. If people who have been recognised as refugees in one Member State seek asylum in another Member State this is likely to be because refugees do not enjoy the right to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they were recognised as such. We should seek to remedy this by including refugees within the scope of an instrument defining the circumstances in which a third country national who is legally resident in one Member State may reside in another Member State. I therefore agree that we should now provide that data on recognised refugees should be erased from EURODAC.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the regulation will not apply to Denmark. This results directly from Denmark's protocol to the Treaty. The Commission does not consider that EURODAC is a measure to build on the Schengen acquis under Article B of the Danish protocol. We understand that Denmark nevertheless may wish to participate in EURODAC, but it remains to be seen what legal formula could be adopted in that case.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which I propose to accept will strengthen the text of the regulation and I am very grateful to Parliament for the important contribution it has made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
