<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to clarify three points in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point, and probably the most politically controversial, is the final status of Kosovo. That is a hot potato, which everyone, including Parliament, has preferred to avoid. Following various discussions in the region, but also with a large number of people here, I have concluded that it is no longer an option to wait any longer, thus delaying the definition of the final status. If you see what problems Kosovo has now, it becomes increasingly evident that, for example, the socio-economic problems can only be solved if Kosovo’s final status becomes clear. After all, many investors refuse to invest in Kosovo, because it is uncertain what status that country has.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also becoming increasingly clear, sadly, that a process has been started in which the international community, once hailed as a liberator, is increasingly being regarded as an occupier. This is very close to my heart, because I believe that the work that was done there was sound. This is, however, the reality in Kosovo and I think that Parliament should also base its conclusions on this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the EU’s responsibility to take the lead to ensure that within a period of – as far as I am concerned – two years, there is clarity with regard to Kosovo’s final status. It is quite clear to me that this will be a difficult choice. I also think that the European Union need not make that choice yet, but the Kosovars do need to know that a decision will be taken on their status in two years’ time. I therefore have a double message to give to the Kosovars: we are prepared to give you clarity about your final status in two years’ time, but you have to prove to us that you are able to manage your country in a proper manner, that is to say in a manner that embraces a decent minorities policy, including respect for the borders as they currently stand. If the Kosovars are able to do this, I think that we should say that in two years’ time, we are prepared to take a decision on their final status. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he can confirm once again what the Commission has already said in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, namely that the European Commission is pleased about – and, as such, is in agreement with – the fact that the European Union is taking the lead in drafting a roadmap, a timeframe – whatever you want to call it – as long as it becomes clear at the end of it what is going to happen with Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about Serbia and Montenegro. I think that two years ago, Mr Solana had good reasons for trying to keep those two countries together. That was necessary then to avoid chaos in the region. Two years have now passed and after trying for one year, those countries have another two years to try to see whether things work out. I think that now, the conclusion can, and should, be drawn that it is not working. Nobody, neither in Montenegro, nor in Serbia, is prepared to invest in this new federation, in these new structures. I think it is therefore appropriate for the European Union to say: we will no longer try to force you into something that neither of you want. We will adopt a neutral position. We will leave it up to you to decide, which also means that if we spend our money in Montenegro or Serbia, we will spend it on areas that need to be improved anyway. There are many of those areas, both in Montenegro and in Serbia, that need funding, irrespective of whether those countries become independent or carry on together.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the final topic. Now that the committee has reached agreement on the above two points, the following point is now at risk of becoming the controversial point in plenary. It is about the fact that a number of countries in that region, three to be precise, have concluded a bilateral agreement with the United States to exclude American citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. It is very clear what the report states in this connection. We regret that Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania have concluded an agreement of that kind. In our view, this should not have happened. We applaud, however, the fact that Croatia has not concluded such an agreement. Moreover, it is laid down that ultimate EU membership of those countries at some point in the future is not compatible with such a bilateral agreement. Accordingly, my message to you is that you will need to discontinue those bilateral agreements in a few years’ time. However, does that now mean that we need to penalise Albania and Bosnia for concluding such an agreement? I would specifically address Mr Swoboda in this respect. He has tabled an amendment by means of which, in my view, he seeks to penalise Albania and Bosnia for making that mistake in the past. Indeed, he wants to rule out an agreement of any kind with those countries, as long as they have this agreement with the United States. Mr Swoboda, I think you have made a big mistake by saying this. Like you, I am angry with the United States for having forced those countries into concluding such an agreement, but I do not want to penalise the Albanians and Bosnians for that reason. In my opinion, we should not hold a competition here in Parliament about who is the biggest fan of the International Criminal Court. I would remind you that the NGO coalition in favour of the Criminal Court did not ask for this either, and to be honest, I think you are asking too much. What should matter to us is to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, our criticism of the United States and of those agreements, and, on the other, recognition that we also want to bring those countries closer to Europe in the next couple of years. We will need an agreement for this. We must not allow them to become the victim of pressure from the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for his excellent report on the annual report on the stabilisation and association process produced by the Commission in March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council need the full support and commitment of Parliament in our efforts to help these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union. Mr Lagendijk's report touches upon some of the essential issues in our current relations with the Western Balkans. We have taken note of all the suggestions made in the report and will consider them carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on some of the specific points raised in the report. Firstly, financial assistance. We are grateful for the support expressed in the Thessaloniki agenda for the Commission's proposal to increase the CARDS budget by more than EUR 200 million for the period 2004-2006, and welcome the fact that the Commission's proposal for the 2004 budget has been approved at first reading. We will also need to reflect carefully on financial assistance for the Western Balkans, in view of the next financial perspectives starting in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the visa regime, the peoples of the region attach great importance to this issue. The Commission will hold discussions with the countries in due course, within the framework of the SAP. This is a long-term issue, however, and has to be put in a broader context. Any progress in this area is also linked to the country's ability to implement major reforms in areas such as the rule of law, combating organised crime, corruption and illegal migration, as well as improving administrative capacity, border control and the security of documents.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Thessaloniki commitments, I believe that work is well under way on implementing our part of the commitments made in Thessaloniki. I am pleased to report that the framework regulation, which will provide the legal base for the European partnerships, was adopted by the Commission last week. These partnerships will help the countries to focus their attention on priority areas and will thus contribute to speeding up the European integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">Twinning, which involves using the human resources of Member States to help the countries of the Western Balkans, is already being used. TAIEX, the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office, which will help these countries harmonise their legislation with the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, will be operational in the near future, and preparations to open up participation in Community programmes and agencies are ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to inform you that the feasibility study on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina was adopted by the Commission yesterday. The study points to both progress and continuing weaknesses. Against this background, the Commission thinks that it should be able to recommend to the Member States the opening of SAA negotiations when Bosnia-Herzegovina has made sufficient progress in meeting a number of short-term priorities that are central to the implementation of such stabilisation and association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia's application is being dealt with in accordance with the usual procedures. We received, within the deadline, more than 10 000 pages of answers from Croatia and if all goes well we hope to finish our work on the opinion by March or April. We also hope that Croatia will be able to improve in areas which are, by the way, indicated in paragraph 37 of the Lagendijk report.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the suggestion of a neutral stance on the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro. The policy of the European Union is to support the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro for the period of the three years provided by the Belgrade agreement. The terms of the agreement are that at the end of that period, it is up to Serbia and Montenegro whether they wish to stay together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has begun work on a feasibility study for Serbia and Montenegro. This will be a thorough objective assessment designed to determine whether the countries are ready to start negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement. As things stand today, we need to see further substantial progress on key issues such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, cooperation and development in the Serbia and Montenegro internal market and a single trade policy, as well as political and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the process leading to the decision of the final status of Kosovo, let me recall that the European Union supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1224 and the 'standards before status' policy. Like the Council, we welcome the intention of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Harry Holkeri, to set out more concrete guidelines for progress, and to implement the 'standards before status' policy on the basis of a work plan to be coordinated with the European Union's monitoring of standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken note that the first opportunity for an overall review will be in mid-2005. 2004 is, therefore, an important year for Kosovo's provisional institutions of self-government to consolidate a truly multi-ethnic and democratic society. Let me reiterate one key point. Whatever the final status, the people of Kosovo will have their place in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that, within the framework of the commitments made by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, launching European integration partnerships for the Western Balkans merits setting a medium-term objective based on an action plan – this is our proposal – setting out the measures and actions which need to be undertaken by the countries of the Western Balkans and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan should contain an enhanced support for institution-building, of course, but also for infrastructure projects and regional trade and economic cooperation projects. In other words, priority should be given to structural and economic reforms leading to functioning market economies and sustainable development. The rate of integration into the European Union will obviously depend on the countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that the stabilisation and association process is the institutional framework for the course towards Europe of the Western Balkans and marks a shift in the centre of gravity from stabilisation to association with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It follows that we are right to adopt the strategy of commencing negotiations towards a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with each country one at a time. It also follows, however, that preparations for accession are primarily in the hands of the governments in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While all the countries listed in the report have problems specific to themselves, there is much that is, more or less, in equally poor shape in all of them. That is why they have to join with us in stepping up the fight against trafficking in human beings, which actually amounts to trafficking in women. They have to combat crime, arms dealing and corruption. Their justice systems are developed to differing degrees, ranging from the just about acceptable to the utterly inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and training are key areas in which these countries also have to make progress or else have no future, as their young people will otherwise leave.</p>
<p class="contents">No satisfactory solution has yet been found to the problem of refugees returning to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hardly any of the Croats expelled from the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska </span>are returning to it, which makes the return of Serbs to Croatia and the restoration of their property there more difficult. A creditable number of Serbs are returning to Croatia, but implementing the restoration of property to Croatia’s Serbs is still not progressing in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, moreover, a great deal of anti-Serb sentiment in several regions, especially in the hinterland of Zadar, and this results in major problems on the ground. In contrast, co-existence in Eastern Slavonia around Vukovar is characterised to a much greater degree by cooperation. There is a good law on minorities, which community leaders must now put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia is cooperating properly with The Hague; even archive documents have been handed over to the tribunal. Indeed, it was in Croatia itself that three accused persons, including a General, received lengthy jail sentences. One accused person, General Gotovina, is on the run. Let us not ask for the impossible; the state has offered a reward for his capture, but so far have not managed to track him down. He is a member of the French Foreign Legion and holds a French passport; heaven knows where he is now. If the international community could not get its hands on Karadzic or Mladic despite SFOR having been present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for seven years, then we should not, in this regard, apply the wrong standard to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to the Croats.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia and Montenegro have demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with The Hague. Things could get even better. They handed Milosevic over, thank God, as well as the three butchers of Vukovar, but many more are still awaiting extradition. It is in Serbia’s interests to be allowed to sentence some war criminals in Serbia itself. It would help the Serbs’ understanding of the situation if the KLA leadership were also, at last, to stand trial in The Hague for their crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an absolute need for improvements in the poor economic state of much of the region, and so the CARDS programme must facilitate more infrastructural measures than before, or else there will be no recovery there.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been improvements in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s development at State level, but there are still many deficits. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the High Representative does not always make use of the powers he possesses. The metaphorical sword of Damocles hanging over Bosnia-Herzegovina would be unnecessary if the EU were – as Commissioner Vitorino has just said – to make demands that Bosnia-Herzegovina can actually meet.</p>
<p class="contents">I ought also to say something about Albania, but I shall skip that; everything is in the report, and I assume that everyone has read it. My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not, admittedly, agree with all the points he makes, but that is the way of things in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Kosovo is concerned, I am right alongside him when it comes to getting a final decision on its future as soon as possible. Any demand for one must be addressed to Kosovo’s government rather than to the Commission, for just as the report states and as we had confirmed to us recently in discussions in Albania, I am firmly convinced that the authorities in Kosovo are not doing enough. I am not saying that they are doing nothing, but they are not doing enough to make it clear that Kosovo is a multi-ethnic state, one that wants to adhere to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino also referred to the issue of ‘standards before status’, which should be given practical expression by such things as the stipulation of more precise deadlines; it is, though, above all for the Albanian authorities in Kosovo to take the necessary action themselves. Whilst I personally favour independence, something has to be done to make it happen; it will not just be presented on a plate.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Montenegro and Serbia, I do in essence take the view that nobody can force them or anyone else to stay together. We have to consider whether the existence of so many small states there will make the process of integrating them into the European Union any easier. It will not be made any easier for the states, but, if that is what they absolutely want, then that is their decision, and they have to know what its consequences will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me address a point to which Mr Lagendijk alluded in connection with one of my amendments. Had we been even only half as courageous, determined, and willing to implement our own decisions as the United States of America, we would have achieved more in the Balkans. Our problem is that we say things like ‘please’ and ‘if you would be so kind’ and ‘do something’, whereas the Americans lay down stringent conditions and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. That is why I do not think we can accept the evident willingness of some states to comply with these conditions. As Mr Lagendijk himself mentioned, Croatia has not concluded the treaty that the United States wanted of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must state loud and clear our view that we cannot simply relegate to the background the International Criminal Court, the case for which your group put to this House with such vigour. If you read the amendment, you will see that I do, in any case, draw a distinction whilst sticking to the view that membership is not a practical option, but saying no more than that one ought not actually to conclude any agreement. That is just an opinion of this House rather than an explicit condition. If we get to the point where draft treaties in respect of these countries are put before us, then we will in any case have to take a decision on their individual merits.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it right that we should retreat so far from a position of this House as made explicit in a motion, but I am still willing to accept a compromise. We should send the clear message that we attach great importance to this International Criminal Court especially in a region in which crimes are committed against human beings and contrary to human decency and that we ask all the states in this region not to play down the issue of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but to unambiguously affirm their political responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe this is a full and exhaustive report which truly deals with the whole range of problems affecting this region. On behalf of my parliamentary group, the Liberal Group, I would like to stress the following points: we fully support the process of integration of these countries of the south east of Europe and we highlight the need to fulfil the political and economic criteria laid down by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the history of these countries – and specifically what took place during the final decade of the last century – has been very important and this demands cooperation from all of them with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia – as other speakers in this debate have stressed – and this should be demanded of all the States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, in this regard as well, that the signature of bilateral agreements with the United States clearly restricts the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, and is not in line with the European Union's approach. What should the European Union do in these cases? Clearly, it should not accept any process of integration. The signature of agreements is an arguable issue and it would be good if on the basis of the discussion which has just taken place the compromise solution could be reached which would indicate that the European Union is not prepared to accept any agreement unless certain conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to point out our group has presented certain amendments, suggested by a Slovenian observer Member, on Kosovo, on the responsibility of the Albanian population in Kosovo, so that it can decide on its future by means of the free exercise of the right to self-determination. We have also presented another amendment on the issue of fishing in the Adriatic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out finally, Madam President, that the report analyses the situation of all the States and, if in any case it appears excessively critical – as we have been told by the representative of Macedonia, for example – it should not be understood as a lack of support on the part of the European Union, but as a contribution to constructive dialogue aimed at improving the situation of these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We agree with the ultimate objective of the report, which is to aid the democratic and economic recovery of this region and its possible integration into Europe. However, we believe that some of the problems have been due to the development of Europe’s own dynamic and also to the fact that at that time we lacked a coherent, constructive and democratic foreign policy and, with our support for ethnic or religious identities, we have created a problem whose consequences we are now paying for.</p>
<p class="contents">All the aspects pointed out in the report are positive. I would like to stress the need to support cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, the criticism of the possibility of signing agreements with the United States, outside of the International Criminal Court, the support for the return of the refugees and displaced persons and, above all - perhaps the most important aspect – the fight against corruption, the fight against organised crime, against the trafficking in women and children, the fight against all trafficking – of drugs, of arms etc. – which is a cancer which is eating away at this region.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we must offer effective help, that the current financial support is insufficient and that therefore we should review the financial perspectives, in order to provide more resources to assist the region in the necessary manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the points made on the different countries are absolutely correct – as Mr Vallvé has said – and the European Union must therefore consider them. I am referring to respect for national minorities and the management of borders in Albania. In the case of Bosnia, it is important to build state structures and promote cooperation with the war crimes tribunals. In relation to Croatia, the importance of national minorities and cooperation with them should be stressed. In Macedonia, the Albanian National Liberation Army must be dismantled and corruption combated. In the case of Serbia, there must be cooperation with the international court in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree with the insinuation in the report of possible independence for Kosovo, because we believe that what was agreed in the United Nations resolution should be respected, making Kosovo a province of the Republic of Serbia and Montenegro, and we see the UN as an international reference body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concerned internal and external Balkan experts have expressed this warning. According to them, the European Union is trying too hard to copy the success of the process of the ten accession countries in South-East Europe. By doing so, the European Union is making excessive demands of states that are not ready for this. The result is that the Stabilisation and Association Process is threatening to degenerate into feigned developments in the countries in question. A simpler, realistic approach to moving closer to Brussels would avoid mutual disappointment. Moreover, it would give the governments of the Western Balkans a real opportunity of scoring political successes in the direction of Europe. This is certainly not insignificant from an electoral viewpoint. Does the Commission share this opinion and is it prepared to help give this shape?</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to be very direct and specific. These days, I am picking up vibes that, generally speaking, the educational level in the Western Balkan is dropping to a worrying level. This applies to primary, secondary and university education alike. I would ask the Commission whether that is true. If so, then here lies an opportunity for us to offer a helping hand by providing the Western Balkans with free access to European education programmes. In that light, Mr Lagendijk’s useful report offers ample opportunity for European self-reflection. Allow me to make three observations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in paragraph 10, does the rapporteur not turn matters on their head in connection with the present visa regime between the European Union and the so-called SAP countries? It seems more logical to me to link a possible easing of the visa regime to a number of EU conditions. This has nothing to do with the humiliation of Balkan citizens to which the rapporteur refers.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly enough, in paragraph 42, Mr Lagendijk urges the European Union to play a role of neutral mediator between Serbia and Montenegro. It is irrelevant to him what form the relationship between Belgrade and Podgornica will take at the end of it. As far as I know, the European Union has to date not practised such neutrality and, as far as I can see, will not attempt to do this either.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation concerns paragraphs 51 and 52. In paragraph 51, the rapporteur is still cautiously positive about the start of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina, with good reason. Incidentally, with this, the UNMIK itself is putting the principle of standards before status under time pressure. That is by the by. Mr Lagendijk subsequently proposes an extra-fast time frame for a final solution to the thorny political issue of Kosovo. Within the next two years! It seems to me that the Serbian-Albanian race for Kosovo is certainly not served, nor helped, by such a political march at top speed. Moreover, we should not overlook the direct regional effects of any actual attempt to address the Kosovo issue. Think of the Albanians in Macedonia and the Serbs in Bosnia. Political stability in the Balkans remains for the time being a precarious matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a balanced and detailed piece of work which covers the issue objectively and gives an overall picture of the situation in the area and in the individual countries. It points out the particular conditions which prevail in each and evaluates the more specific data which document the various manifestations of their cooperation with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the report – correctly in my opinion – stresses the serious importance within the priorities of the European Union of preparing the countries of South-East Europe for future integration into the European structures. It stresses that the progress of each country, as far as its accession is concerned, will depend on the degree to which it meets the Copenhagen criteria and the terms of the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, irrespective of the anticipated peculiarities that characterise the countries in question, the basic principle must remain that all are dealt with and judged in the same way when weighing their virtues and their shortcomings, as regards the possibility of full integration into the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to agree with the rapporteur that the 'hot potato' in the area is the Kosovo regime, but I believe that any rushed decision or action must be avoided in order to first safeguard the necessary preconditions for smoothing out the situation, with respect for the rights of all interested parties and for the related United Nations resolutions and the principle of safeguarding the external borders of the countries in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take this opportunity to refer to the particular subject touched on in paragraph 21 of the report and to expressly state that the European Parliament regrets the flagrantly unacceptable manner in which the recent local elections were conducted in Albania. Unfortunately, the sad irregularities and the blatant violation of democratic procedures and values which provoked this clear remark on the part of the rapporteur – with which my honourable friend Mrs Pack agreed on behalf of my political group – were repeated, to a more acute degree, with a plethora of clashes, acts of violence and undermining of the democratic morale of citizens and candidates in the repeat elections just three days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to hope that the Albanian authorities will understand the message which Parliament is sending them via the Lagendijk report and will strengthen their commitment to ensuring the smooth operation of democracy and the rule of law in their country, so that relations between Albania and the European Union and the successful completion of the stabilisation and association agreement are not adversely affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a serious step in the success of the policy applied in the region by the European Union which, basically, has the main responsibility for the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Already, Croatia has applied to join the European Union. The new constitutional institutions in the FYROM and the new form of Serbia with Montenegro appear to be starting to work. There also appear to be signs of economic mobility. However, the situation is far from qualifying as stable from every side. None of us should entertain any false notions. The Stability Pact is being applied to an area which continues to be politically fragile and unstable. The only line of approach of our policy must be the interest of the citizens and peoples in the area. There can be no thought of special benefits or interests. Insistence on democratic procedures, human rights, regional cooperation, respect for minorities, the return of refugees, the jurisdiction of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague and, generally, the full application of all the UN Security Council resolutions is the only way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention here with both regret and seriousness the unacceptable conditions in Himara – and elsewhere in Albania – during the recent local elections, when every concept of electoral procedure was violated by the official authorities, as was respect for the rights of the Greek minority. It would be good if the Albanian authorities helped their country to improve its democratic institutions if they want to proceed positively in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who speculate about the future of crisis areas such as Kosovo and others who hint at either the creation of a new state entity or broad autonomy which will basically be equivalent to independence. They must realise that the constitutional and state regime, be it in the FYROM, be it in Bosnia-Herzegovina, be it in Serbia-Montenegro, is based on fine balances, with concealed nationalisms, and that time is needed for the new institutions to stabilise and mature. It is positive that there is contact between Belgrade and Pristina within the framework of the UN and this must be supported. However, every new superficial movement will result in a new domino effect with unforeseeable consequences. In all the countries of the Stability Pact, there are close ethnic minorities which are the local majority and border other countries in which the corresponding ethnic groups are in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">All the states should protect their minorities living within them. They are also their citizens. All the state borders should remain stable. Care must be taken not to expound theories which lead to concepts such as city-states, or may even go as far as state-neighbourhoods or state-families. We must prevent the mobilisation of forces by neighbouring countries to protect national minorities inadequately protected by the countries of which they are citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We must insist on 'peace, democracy, security, cooperation, stability' and the only message to all the countries is that the European Union is waiting for them, they just have to speed up their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, a comment outside my speech. There is a technical issue. On certain sides, the official name of the FYROM is not used correctly. It would be good if the texts were corrected as usual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has said that even the most basic cooperation, such as access to documents and witnesses, as well as arrests and the transfer of fugitives, is still not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of indicted war criminals are still at large in Serbia-Montenegro, including Ratko Mladic, who was responsible for killing 7 000 people in the genocide at Srebrenica.</p>
<p class="contents">Of particular concern is the case of Croatia. I join others in welcoming Croatia's European aspirations. However, requests for cooperation from the tribunal are taking up to a year to process, which is totally unacceptable. For example, there is the matter of General Ante Gotovina, ICTY's third most wanted man, who was responsible for arranging the killing of at least 150 Serb civilians and the expulsion of 150 000 others in 1995. Miss Del Ponte has outlined information that he is still in Croatia, with reports that he is being sheltered by people working for the Croatian authorities. He is reported as: 'enjoying his summer holiday, sailing on a yacht'. Until further moves are made towards Gotovina's arrest, Croatia is still not fully complying with UNSC Resolution 1503. There can be no serious moves towards EU accession until this essential step is taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
