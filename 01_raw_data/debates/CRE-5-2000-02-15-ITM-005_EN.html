This House has been utterly lax on the substance and yet, at the same time, is asking for ever greater decision-making power to the detriment of the national parliaments. The combination of these two positions makes for a mixture which could be disastrous for the future for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I counted no less than seven calls in the resolution, at different points, for equal rights for European citizens and legal immigrants. This has become a real obsession. As for the fight against illegal immigration, this House is hardly interested. There is absolutely nothing in the resolution on border controls. Even when the question of Eurodac or readmission clauses is briefly mentioned, it is only to deplore the over-strictness of the Council on these subjects. Yet the standard call for a fund for refugees, financed from the Community budget, is there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament calls for a review of immigration policy in view of the population situation. It is clear what this means. At the same time, the resolution calls for new codecision powers for the European Parliament on immigration. You can imagine what would come of this. As was to be expected, the Commission has just lent its support in the opinion tabled for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group believes that it would be dangerous to go down this road. Instead, on these matters, we should stick with the people and national sovereignty. This is why the procedures of the first pillar on the single market must not be transposed exactly as they are for the areas of security, justice or foreign policy. For these areas, the Intergovernmental Conference must devise new cooperation procedures based on the political role of the Council and interparliamentary control exercised by the national parliaments.</p>

<p class="contents">There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People’s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent. However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference. We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13. An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People’s Party has been advocating for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States. Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants. In terms of human rights, this is a backward step. Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium. Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution. The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example – and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this – by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects. Disparate actions are not effective. We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies. They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in today’s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected. This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected. We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established. The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled ‘sustainable urban policy’.</p>

Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.

<p class="contents">With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe. At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas. Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved. This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable. The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas. This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors. It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups. We can therefore welcome its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory! The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge. The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%! This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative. The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low. It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime. Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt. Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people. Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union’s desire to communitise urban policy. It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies. Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets. Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe. We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project. In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted. The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities. We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion. On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs. On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.</p>

Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative. As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive. These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development. Why am I stressing this point? The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted. For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU’s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed. I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction. We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley. However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32. In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally. Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990. This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union. INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration. More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.</p>
<p class="contents">In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators. In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment. Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility. I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region! INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG! The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy! I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool’s bargain for French taxpayers. France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds. Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions. This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds. This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats. These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid. We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers. These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.

<p class="contents">I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative. This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented. This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake. I am aware of the Commission’s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November. However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this is the ‘Celtic’ area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector. It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions. This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the ‘continentalisation’ of the European Union. This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">The maritime world has great potential. We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU should be prepared to meet that competition. We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community. It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders. It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides. A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.

<p class="contents">I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations. We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report. We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories. The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States. This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that <span class="italic">‘the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation’</span> (p.17) and that <span class="italic">‘the responsibilities are diffuse and vague’</span> (p.18). Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière’s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual. It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, first I should like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the focal points of the Commission’s new programme.</p>
<p class="contents">That applies in particular to the integrated, multisectoral approach which is gaining ground in the agricultural sector and which is highlighted time and again by national agricultural ministers in the Member States. And greater emphasis on environmental protection in connection with rural areas in general is extremely important for the future of all of us. Referring to farmers as the guardians of the countryside best expresses the preferred direction of future agricultural policy, and, of course, its transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take it as a good sign that, thanks to one of the most fundamental changes to the LEADER+ programme, all rural areas and hence 80% of the total area of the European Union and 25% of the people in the 15 Member States will be able to benefit from the programme. However, the total sum for the six-year period has been pitched low, too low, at EUR </p>
<p class="contents">2 020 million. In addition, and this is what concerns me most, still no provision has been made for initiatives geared to mountain areas. Parliament refers in the LEADER+ programme to the sparsely-populated areas of northern Europe, but not to the often equally thinly-populated and hence less favoured mountain areas.</p>

One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.

Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU’s rural development policy. Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP’s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives. This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation. A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.</p>
<p class="contents">We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons. </p>
<p class="contents">The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO. The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy. The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience. In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +). This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%. LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2. LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions. We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of ‘Agenda 2000’ and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences. </p>
<p class="contents">We disagree with many of the report’s views. Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 – Agenda 2000). We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside’s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside’s basic social and economic branch. For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes. We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside. Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative. It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of ‘economic and social cohesion’ rather than ‘regional development’ as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 replaces ‘government or municipal officials’ with ‘government officials’. Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments. The rapporteur’s phrasing was therefore too limiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House. It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA. In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives. The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur. The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative. The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union’s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on. In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives. The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years. This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
