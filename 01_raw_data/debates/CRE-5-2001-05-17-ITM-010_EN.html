We thought that slavery had been stamped out, but it continues to exist, and the most shocking form of slavery is, of course, the trafficking in children and the trade in child slaves. Children are being shipped off to work on plantations. Children are being abducted to be trained as soldiers, to carry weapons, to become a killing machine or to provide sexual services. Children are orphaned at an early age if their parents die of AIDS, and are then hired as house slaves of those who supposedly take care of them. In short, children are often slaves. Nevertheless, Africa is not traditionally considered a continent where it is customary to sell children. Abject poverty is at the root of child slavery, and child labour contravenes the Treaty on the Rights of the Child. Echoing what is stipulated in the resolution, I would therefore call on the Commissioner to focus on, and put an end to, the networks which set up the trafficking in children, to launch reintegration programmes for rescued or escaped children, but also for former child soldiers and street children, and above all, I would urge you to help ensure that the products of Africa are sold at a fair price, so that the parents can work, and can let their children go to school, as that is what is supposed to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we established when we attended the parliamentary meeting in Gabon within the framework of the ACP-EU, these children are from various neighbouring countries and are taken to elite families in Gabon, for example, where they work in the household. They are farmed out by the ‘aunties’ – for that is the nice word for it, go-betweens, if you like – among those families. That means that they end up being slaves in those households, that they do not get any schooling, that they have to work from early in the morning until late at night, and that they are simply being robbed of their freedoms as a child. That contravenes all kinds of ILO Treaties. It is also fundamentally at odds with the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">One could at least expect that the elite itself, which often forms part of governments in the relevant ACP countries, would not take part in this practice. One could at least expect that according to the statutory rules of that country, action would be taken, or that they would take action amongst themselves. That is not done, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the countries involved not to classify this phenomenon under the heading of poverty, cultural tradition or ‘that is how things are around here’, and therefore difficult to stamp out, but to see this to be in conflict with human rights. Children have human rights, which are fundamental agreements. I hope that we will be able to take a pro-active stance and penalise those countries, should this appear necessary. That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to broaden the topic and include child labour, but I explicitly focused on this well-defined problem in West Africa. The violation of children’s rights should finally be a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poor families in debt give their children on loan to the creditors as deposit, or to pay off their loans. However, because they cannot get out of the red, the children are often sold and moved to other countries. There they are used as household helps, unpaid workers on cocoa or cotton plantations, or employed in the sex industry. Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished. The discovery of the Nigerian ship <span class="italic">Etireno</span> in the port of Cotonou is probably only the thin end of the wedge. The international labour organisation estimates that there are 250 million child slaves worldwide. Surely it is unacceptable that practices such as trafficking in children and slavery still exist, and even thrive, in the twenty-first century. We should therefore put more mechanisms in place to track down and punish the trade in and use of child slaves. The legal apparatus <span class="italic">in situ</span> should be given far more resources and be better equipped to fight malpractices of this kind, and multinational companies must abide by the moral code not to abuse children for commercial purposes. At the same time, we must have the courage to tackle the underlying causes: poverty and unemployment. Let us hope that the pledge of debt discharge which was made at the Conference of the Least Developed Countries in Brussels this week is kept, and that our markets will at long last be opened up to agricultural products from those countries, so that we can give those people something to sell other than their children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Africa, thousands are in forced labour in the coffee and cocoa plantations, the produce from which is often destined for export. That makes us indirect accessories to what is happening. Many of these countries, it should be said, have signed the convention on children's rights or the convention banning child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Parliament cannot simply continue to take note of the multiplicity of legal instruments intended to ensure that children's rights are respected at international level or to issue a sort of good conduct label under the various conventions which these countries have signed unless there is a binding force somewhere. It is up to us to react rapidly, as has been said, by punishing or even excluding any country which violates these conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to point out that there are different debates, which take place at three different levels. There is the first level, which is the direct result of misery and unemployment, as we have heard, and it goes without saying that the IMF and the World Bank cannot continue to burden Africa with so-called structural adjustment policies. We know full well today that this debt hangs over Africa like a sword of Damocles and the IMF in particular needs a clear policy here. However, there is another debate which I think, as a parliamentarian, involves questioning if it is conceivable nowadays to keep all these conventions, all these different conventions, and accept that these countries are not going to comply with them. What is the point? Finally, I think it is important for us to think about much more potent matters. In particular, I think that we should introduce a European social label which requires products from Africa and Asia to indicate their exact origin, so that we can see if they come from countries which exploit children or violate the labour code. Finally, I think that, as my fellow Member has said, the summit of Least Developed Countries is being held at this very moment with the European Parliament, including European leaders. I think that it is important for us to be able to call on them and for them to be able to take urgent measures on this form of modern slavery which affects children, children the same age as our children in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This problem has come to public attention due to the voyage of a boat, the <span class="italic">Etireno</span>, from Benin to Gabon. However, UNICEF had already clearly said that more than 200 000 children in Western and Central Africa were growing up in this awful way. When we see how European children grow up, we have to think about these African children. It is terrible to think that children aged between 7 and 15 are used as modern-day slaves in a wide variety of work, and sometimes for the sexual perversions of certain people.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with the measures that are proposed in the resolution: we need to inform consumers not to buy products that are known to be made or produced through the work of these children. We need to ask for a fair price and practice fair trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the amendment tabled by my colleagues from the Green Group on the revision, with this in mind, of the World Trade Organisation standards. The Council and the European institutions need to work together with the countries that these children come from and go to in order to fight this horrific trafficking. Also, at the next sitting of the United Nations, which is devoted to children’s rights, the European institutions need to adopt a belligerent approach to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague Mr Fodé Sylla was saying, recital G talks clearly about the effects of growing poverty on this problem. I think that we should ask ourselves if it is ethically acceptable to support a system that has such an awful effect on a sector of the population that is as weak as children are. Mr President, I think that we need to start thinking about whether we can allow this to happen.</p>

According to UNICEF figures, over 200 000 children are victim to cross-border trafficking in West and Central Africa. We call on the governments of these countries to do everything in their power to combat and punish the criminal practices of child traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's strategy to combat trafficking in children and child labour is based mainly on its measures to reduce poverty in Africa. This is the primary objective of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that the Commission is pursuing a strategy to promote food security and rural development in the countries of Africa, focusing mainly on the situation of women and children in its bid to bring about sustainable development in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission is funding measures which will help directly to resolve this problem. For example, over EUR 1.2 million have been provided to promote the rights of children and to protect children from violence and exploitation in Gabon, Benin, Togo and Nigeria. In addition, the Commission is funding a special project in this area in Benin, the objective being to build up a so-called brigade to protect minors, help ensure laws are implemented more efficiently and raise public awareness of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Protecting and promoting the rights of children is one of the focal points of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2001. A host of other measures is being implemented by the relevant international organisations, especially UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation. A positive sign recently is that other countries will probably ratify the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention No 182. Benin ratified this convention last Monday, on 14 May, and Côte d'Ivoire should follow suit by the end of this month. The Commission emphatically supports these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication on human rights which the Commission adopted on 8 May 2001 contains concepts for political dialogue with partner countries. Most importantly, it states that, during discussions, the parties should examine how basic human rights instruments and other international agreements based on human rights can be ratified and implemented effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the trade agreement is concerned, the European Union is currently enlisting support from its trading partners for these basic labour standards to be applied to child labour. The Commission feels that consideration should be given to additional trade preferences under the general preference system for countries which implement these standards efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
