The case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a concrete example of how various means are used to break them down both mentally and physically. Whilst Platon Lebedev received inadequate treatment for his serious illness north of the Arctic Circle, Khodorkovsky was attacked in his cell by night. No precise evidence is available as to what happened. That such a thing should occur is incomprehensible in view of the fact that the prisoners are under permanent observation. This occurrence confirms the dire conditions in Russian prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s holding the presidency of the Council of Europe offers an opportunity to approach it and call upon its government to agree to Khodorkovsky and Lebedev receiving the independent medical examination that has hitherto been denied them.

However, it has been 87 years since the barbaric genocide of Turkish Greeks by Kemal Ataturk. On 19 May 1919, he entered the city and slaughtered 490 000 people. The Black Sea turned red. Observers at the time said that there were squares piled with the heads of innocent people. The only difference is that post-Hitler Germany said sorry. Turkey has never said sorry, either for the genocide of the Turkish Greeks or for the genocide of the Armenians. On the contrary, the other day it coerced the French parliament into withdrawing the Armenian genocide bill and three days ago in Vienna Mr Erdogan embarrassed the Greek prime minister because we want to acknowledge the genocide of the Turkish Greeks.</p>

It is important to point out that, as a cross-border activity, trafficking knows no borders. All European countries should implement all the various directives as required.

The questions mainly concentrated on some of her business dealings with entrepreneurs who seek to increase their profits by flouting the law or by deliberately acting against the general interest. Mrs Kroes’ answer, at the time, was that she had learned from her previous mistakes. She was reported to have ended all her business interests and relations prior to her possible appointment. It was in part this undertaking that meant that she was eventually considered an acceptable candidate by a majority in this House.</p>

However, we are now witnessing the erosion of the traditional communities and destruction of our landscape due to the total disregard for sensible and locally acceptable planning developments. You might ask who is responsible for this. Have a guess: the regional assemblies accountable directly to Brussels. Is this surprising? Not at all, when you consider that planning applications and projects are no longer discussed with the people that they affect.</p>
<p class="contents">To protect England’s precious greenbelt land and to end overdevelopment and towns merging, we have to abolish these unwanted and undemocratic assemblies and return planning issues to where they have been dealt with traditionally: town halls. Then, and only then, will our greenbelt land be given the protection and respect it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She made a statement comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union. I must say that it is not a fair comparison. I shall just relate one little anecdote. Mr Prodi, the previous President of the Commission, went to Estonia before it joined the European Union. He was asked why Estonia should join the European Union, since it was just like the Soviet Union. He thought for a while and said that it was a valid point, but he could not exactly remember when Estonia applied for membership of the Soviet Union. I think Mrs Krupa should always keep that in mind when she thinks about Poland’s role in the European Union: it is there because membership is in its interests and came about through a democratic process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
