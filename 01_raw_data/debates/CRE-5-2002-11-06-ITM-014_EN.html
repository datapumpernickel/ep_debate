<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schroedter (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and social cohesion is at the very heart of the European Union. It offers the prospect of sustainable, harmonious and at the same time policentric development for the EU as a whole. The current debate is about the European Union of the future, be it a Union of 25 or even 27 Member States. This Union's commitment to integration will only continue to be credible if there is a corresponding willingness to jointly accept responsibility for the European social model in a spirit of solidarity. Our starting point has to be the assumption that the public's view of Europe does not depend on their regional and social position and is being tackled as a joint political exercise by all the Member States. We further need to assume that all our citizens are being given comparable opportunities and that we are not living our lives at the cost of the next generation. Nevertheless, it would be an illusion to believe that we have substantially more money available for this task than is currently the case. That is why it is our job to develop a concept which will function in line with the basic principles I have mentioned and which can at the same time manage with the same financial resources, in relative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">While my report was going through its various stages in this House, I found I received different answers to these questions. One group says we should fight to make sure that everything is acceptable to everyone, and that everything will resolve itself later on. Others say that everything is acceptable as long as their own constituency does not lose its privileges. They demand solidarity for their constituency but they are not willing to participate in a wider solidarity. There are others again who do not accept the European social model anyway, and who welcome this dispute. And there are those who dare not tell the truth and accept the consequences. The truth is that we need to start to plan now if we want to make the first payments to the regions on 1 January 2007. No one can talk their way out of that one, because we know that two years are tight enough as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows what the central issue is: how do we define the poorest regions of the European Union? The main principle of economic and social cohesion is that those areas that have the most catching up to do should receive the most support. However, as I see it, the concept of solidarity becomes meaningless if we repeatedly invent new criteria in order to ensure that our own constituency receives the support that is really intended for the poorest regions. In any case, that is short-term thinking. Widening the criterion in force and recognised up to now, according to which any regions with a GDP below 75% of the Community average are considered the most needy regions, will have a number of consequences. Firstly, it will mean that everyone will receive less money, that the phasing-out process will not continue, and that special regional support for the unemployed or for rural areas will no longer be possible. Another consequence will be that we will simply have to pump support into genuinely disadvantaged regions like those in Eastern Europe over a longer period. Another possibility is that constituencies that require intervention at present will suddenly become net contributors. The study by the German Institute for Economic Research indicates that this would happen in three years. The worst consequence of this plan and of this short-term thinking would be that it would mean the end of solidarity. In that case we would have nothing left at all, because we would have no plan and economic and social cohesion would be an empty cliché.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from an Objective 1 region that would lose its status for statistical reasons if we strictly observed the 75% criterion, and yet I am convinced that generous phasing out would make it possible for that region to solve its development problems. If we in Parliament establish a cornerstone for the Structural Funds of the EU of the future, with clearly defined Objective 1 regions, we will on the one hand oblige the Commission to follow where we lead and on the other hand we will be issuing a challenge to the Council. I would like a roll-call vote on this tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things on which we can agree. One principle we agreed upon was that of ‘one programme – one fund’. This is an effective concept for simplifying the management of the Structural Funds. We have also agreed to support the Commission's idea of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States for the implementation of structural policy measures, so as to facilitate the participation of local stakeholders. I hope that this means we will be supporting an efficient and successful concept and not undermining solidarity within Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter on behalf of the Commission for the report she has compiled. Her report represents a very important contribution to the debate on the future of cohesion policy. This debate began in January 2001 with the adoption of the second report on cohesion drawn up by Mr Barnier. It is essential that, in view of the Commission’s preparation of proposals on the future of this policy, we should work towards establishing a consensus between the different institutions involved, as the rapporteur has just explained.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will respond to the different issues the honourable Member mentioned within the framework of the second progress report on cohesion. This report will be adopted by the Commission at the beginning of 2003. We will include a more specific and in-depth response to these same issues in the third report on cohesion we are scheduled to present at the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the Commission has already promised to include proposed priorities which should form the basis for the policy from 2007 to 2013 in the third report on cohesion to be put before Parliament and the Council. We have also promised to propose a new system for the organisation and management of the policy in the same report.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to put a joint proposal on the table, one that responds adequately to the key issues already raised by the House concerning the European Union´s response to the future of the economic and social problems of both present and future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards consistency across different Community policies, the current review of governance has already yielded a number of possible courses of action that the Commission will be sure to take into account when preparing future policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges of enlargement are certainly not limited only to discussions on decision-making procedures or the distribution of competencies. Policies on these issues should also provide for the greater diversity and greater imbalance among the different areas which will constitute the future European Union. In addition, policies should set out the precise contribution to be made by Member States to the economic and social cohesion of the European Union as a whole, and its effects, albeit in purely statistical terms. This will have to be taken into account. Regions that are currently poor will not become richer just because some new arrivals are poorer. The poor regions will simply be less poor than some of those due to become part of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, what is most important is that the economic and social imbalances between the new and the old Member States can be effectively diminished. Enlargement, however, must not lead to a situation where regional policy in the most disadvantaged regions of the current Member States is wound down. Other factors besides figures for GDP have also to be taken into account, such as regional climate, remoteness, sparse population and the unemployment rate. At the same time differences in living standards on the Union’s new external borders must also be reduced. The Committee on Foreign Affairs would like to remind everyone that every European state that meets the conditions of membership has the right to join the Union and would like to stress how important it is to assist them in preparing for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament’s northernmost Member, I know how important these proposals are in practice. EU enlargement will do nothing to improve the relative position of Lapland or other peripheral regions of Finland and Sweden. Actually, it is more likely to weaken it, as the wealthiest regions will reap the benefits of enlargement. The northern areas of our neighbour, Norway, are now experiencing vigorous economic development as a result of investment in energy and sound regional policy. In circumstances such as these EU regional policy must not be watered down, but should be strengthened in accordance with the principles underlying the Northern Dimension. Our other neighbour, Russia, has many problems that threaten our wellbeing and security. The EU therefore has to become more effective beyond both the current and the future external border, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs suggests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second report on cohesion has shown that aid currently provided by the common agricultural policy favours producers in the more developed agricultural areas rather than those in the less developed ones. It would therefore be a mistake not to alter a system of aid which values production above other economic, social, environmental and land-related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the latest proposals presented by the Commission contained in the mid-term review and the reform of the common agricultural policy could exacerbate still further the differences between the more and less developed rural areas. All the necessary impact studies must therefore be carried out before these reforms are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, rural areas account for 80% of the European Union, and this percentage will increase following enlargement. The negative effects of the common agricultural policy, which has not fulfilled initial expectations, will therefore be even greater. We cannot do away with the functional model which has to underpin our agricultural policy. Nonetheless, we need to define new aid for small farmers, and policies to redistribute resources more equitably. Environmental conditions have to be mainstreamed. We should link agricultural and environmental polices and coordinate them. We must ensure our policies do provide for cohesion. Otherwise they could have a devastating effect in rural areas and cause a huge exodus from the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be specific support for young farmers to establish themselves, and support also for small farmers who guarantee rural sustainability. Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture has concluded that enlargement will increase regional disparities and that targeted measures and an increase in structural funds will be needed to counter this.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement and its negative effect on statistics will exclude a large number of regions which currently meet the criteria for Objective 1. For this reason we need to set a transitional period for these regions. We also need to devise a new classification system that takes account of the specific disadvantages of each region. I have in mind depopulation or the relief of the land.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement does not just pose a challenge for Objective 1 rural areas. We must also remember that a kind of hidden enlargement is taking place as a result of Association Agreements with third countries to the south. Above all, there is one principle that we should re-define, namely Community preference in the general context of cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, I feel that it is premature to ask the Commission to produce a proposal on the future of the Objective 2 regions and the future of Community initiatives even before the third report on economic and social cohesion is published, not least in that the time frames necessary for an in-depth analysis to be carried out by December 2003 – Commissioner Barnier’s deadline for presenting the report – have not been established and we have not been provided with the necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">We would prefer to be able to take the time necessary to work on reforming cohesion policy, in other words to work according to the time frames specified by the Commission, avoiding, above all, hasty conclusions being drawn which will not benefit the regions and will benefit the new Member States still less.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to point out that, in an enlarged Union, some of the Objective 1 regions will automatically statistically exceed the threshold of 75% of the average Union GDP without this representing any genuine increase in development. In this respect, in line with what was decided in the second report on economic and social cohesion, for which I was the rapporteur, I feel it is inadequate to take GDP as the only indicator. Other criteria, including, in particular, the unemployment rate, should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the Union’s policies and the sectoral policies of the Member States must focus on the achievement of cohesion objectives and sustainable development plans for the regions. Lastly, we will vote against paragraphs 16 and 22, for they are repetitions of paragraphs already included in the rapporteur’s text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be more precise, this report is about the direction Parliament wishes to go in. I am quite willing to admit that we have not totally achieved that, because there is still too much in this report, but I still think that it is a good one. All in all, I do not think the picture is as black as the rapporteur has painted it.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we have once again emphasised certain points that have already been identified, such as our rejection of any renationalisation of structural policy. We have also once again made it clear that regions currently benefiting from support will have to accept cuts; we do not want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes about this. However, we have also managed to clarify some points in this report. I disagree totally with the previous speaker on this, because I think it is very important for the Commission to make proposals at this stage about how it will move forward with Objective 2. People are waiting for a signal in Objective 2 regions too, and we cannot just concentrate on Objective 1 in our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to Community initiatives. This is also an important area where we need to either clarify matters or at least identify a recognisable direction. How will the Community Action for Border Regions be continued? And how will action on cities move forward? And rural areas? I would like to stress two more points of great concern to me. One is that the programme must be scheduled to start so that funds are actually available on 1 January 2007, and, equally important, we need a more coherent approach, and in that regard we need to send a signal to the Commission that it should at long last achieve greater coherence between individual policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: I believe, and my group has also taken a decision to this effect, that for Objective 1 we should neither establish a fixed criterion nor a fixed percentage. We need to make a decision on the basis of concrete proposals, and the Commission is in the process of drawing something up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to say that the committee of which I am chairman has discussed the matter in depth with its usual skill and has put a tremendous amount of effort into finding solutions for both present and future situations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first progress report on the second report on cohesion, which has come just a few weeks before the second progress report and a few months before the third report on cohesion, which, as has already been said, will be the decisive report.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the backdrop to the debate? The first point concerns the current programming period. There has been a great deal of discussion in recent days on the need for expenditure and simplification. These are recurring themes which must serve as some kind of warning for the future too, and by the future I mean the 2007-2013 programming period, the crucial time for the accession of a further 10, then to be 12 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many problems and areas of concern, and I would like to mention one which is of particular interest to me. A few days ago, in Brussels, the Commission organised an extremely interesting meeting on the mountain regions. For those mountain regions which will not be covered by Objective 1, there is a possibility that a specific fund can be set up on the basis of the concept contained in the second report on cohesion of regions which suffer from permanent geographical or natural handicaps. These would include mountain regions, remote islands and sparsely populated regions. In addition to providing more funds for these regions, this would also introduce rules which are fairer than competition rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite right not to go into detail and not to give precise figures, but the key points need to be identified and central issues need to be resolved in good time. One of these central issues is the 0.45% share of the Union’s GDP set aside for cohesion policy, which may not be exceeded even during EU enlargement. Another central issue is treating the regions as a reference unit for cohesion policy tasks and not nation-state criteria. Anyone who would like to see anything else is missing the point. A further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear, transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of ‘poor regions’. These and these alone can be dependent on the 75% criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">Any other factors taken as a basis for measurement cannot be clearly quantified and open the way to arbitrary decision-making. This even applies to a criterion such as unemployment, for which there is no EU-wide definition and which is therefore bound to lead to inaccurate estimates. When it comes to supporting disadvantaged regions, we first need to consider those regions with less than 75% of EU GDP. But those regions that will be lifted over the 75% threshold after enlargement, becoming ‘statistically wealthy’, also need to have a more generous phasing-out arrangement. We wish to see regions receiving more support the closer they are to the 75% threshold. In this respect I agree with the rapporteur, who has tabled an amendment on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking in particular of the extended partnership which the report supports in the form of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States. I think this proposal is a daring move; it will make it easier to apply the principle of subsidiarity and cut out a lot of unwanted red tape. We should also be encouraged by the fact that the most efficient programmes have been those based on maximum participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Any innovation, however, needs to be introduced carefully, under some sort of failsafe procedure, if we are to avoid rocking the boat and ensure that financial prudence under the Community budget is left well alone. I therefore think it would be advisable if the Commission were to fine tune this proposal, so that we can evaluate how and to what extent it can be implemented in the initial phase and then go on to examine application guidelines for it. We shall also have to monitor the implementation of this extended partnership closely, in tandem with the potential for decentralisation of each Member State, both old and new. I should also like to point out that, despite the simplifications and changes decided under Agenda 2000, there is still a serious take-up problem and appropriations are not turning into payments.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do we conclude from all this? Do we need to keep simplifying procedures or is there perhaps a deep-seated structural problem which the Commission and Member States need to address? Has Community funding perhaps become so complicated that it no longer holds any attraction for investors? To close, may I point out that this matter deserves our serious attention, especially in the run up to enlargement, which will obviously exacerbate the take-up problem in that our new partners will also have to deal with difficulties caused by their lack of experience in applying the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures to achieve economic balance have been inadequate. Differences in levels of prosperity between regions have even increased to some extent. Differences in levels of unemployment have also to be taken into serious consideration when planning regional and structural policy. Commitment on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to projects, and targeting structural actions at the most disadvantaged regions are important areas of emphasis. Furthermore, regional development must be supported by other areas of policy, such as agricultural, taxation and transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with many of the other speakers that GDP is not the only criterion to use when determining eligible areas. Permanent handicaps due to difficult natural conditions must equally be taken into account. For example, an exceptionally sparse population, migration, an ageing population, long distances, and a cold or hot climate cause permanent problems. In the future we shall have to pay very special attention to the issue of strengthening rural vitality and diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">If Union enlargement is to take place, cohesion policy will need to be strengthened. At the same time we have to remember that regional differences are not going to disappear because new poor regions will be joining the Union. Enlargement must not come about at the expense of the more disadvantaged areas but through united efforts. As Mr Caveri said, the simplification and clarification of regional and structural policy also remain a continual challenge. The administrative load must be lightened, for example, by switching to the ‘one fund’ principle. It is important that all the Union’s resources should be efficiently utilised, even in the remotest regions. Together we must ensure that the whole of the area of the Union is included in the single market and enjoys the benefits which that brings with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to begin by stressing that I come from a region which does not meet Objective 1 criteria. It never has been an Objective 1 region, and never will be. My region is an Objective 2 region. That said, I would also like to point out that in the past, this House heard from leaders with a vision of the future who set courses of action leading to the growth and development of a European policy for union, based on a policy of social cohesion. What we are experiencing today is not however in line with that approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly alarmed by the plans to reduce the growth and development of social cohesion policies. I would go so far as to say that these are penny-pinching plans. To date, social cohesion has been at the heart of policy within the European Union. It is, at the very least, surprising that reference is made to minimum percentages when there are regions exceeding the 200 GDP level.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Vice-President rightly said, what we are about is ensuring there will be no more poor regions. We should encourage all European regions to involve themselves in the cohesion-building process. We must prevent any increase in differences. The last report demonstrated that whilst it is true that the poorest regions have achieved growth in percentage terms, the richer regions have grown at least as much. That is another issue to be studied. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a problem to be resolved in the future, and not now, as currently proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of Europe will depend to a large extent on how the three major processes interact, and the extent to which the European Parliament succeeds in influencing these processes will determine the extent to which its role of codecision is a proper political role rather than just a formality.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has only just begun, and I am pleased to say I have just three points to make today. Firstly, cohesion policy must remain one of the driving forces of the European Union. Secondly, the need for cohesion support cannot be determined on the basis of the unfair, unreliable, misleading parameter of GDP. We call upon the European Commission to specify new parameters – unemployment, infrastructure and quality of the environment – which are more correct indicators throughout the Union. We in this House want to help you. Thirdly, the implementing phase of Agenda 2000 must be monitored carefully, not just as regards quantity and expenditure but also as regards quality. Preparing our regions for enlargement means also and above all using these funds to increase the competitiveness of our human and social capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, as I am sure you can work out, concerns the amount of funds to be allocated to this crucial pillar of the process of European integration during the period 2007 to 2013. This is a key political issue because Europe will only be viable if it is founded on a project of solidarity towards its most disadvantaged regions; the European Union will not succeed on the basis of excessive regional disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">By subscribing to the Franco-German agreement on the freezing of common agricultural policy spending until 2013 on the basis of spending in 2006, the last European Council, held in Brussels, makes the assumption that the same principle of freezing could also be applied to funds earmarked for cohesion policy. In other words, the same Union budget that has served a Europe of fifteen countries will also have to serve a Europe of twenty-seven. To this we can add the end of the illusion that the savings made from the CAP could be channelled into cohesion policy; not forgetting that strengthening the rural development of the CAP has been extremely difficult and the CAP, as we know, has a cohesion-based approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be said that a cohesion policy that is funded to an approximate value of 0.45% of Community GDP would already be a major achievement. At least scenarios of renationalisation, which have been brewing in some countries where cohesion policy is concerned, would be averted. Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise the lack of resources, which endangers the future existence of a balanced cohesion policy that on the one hand does not ignore the cohesion deficit that still exists in today’s European Union of fifteen and on the other, that is equal to the task of the greatest challenge ever set for the process of European integration. I would also emphasise, with regard to this matter and in conclusion, the contrast with the recent past, when financial resources for cohesion have been doubled where other major challenges have arisen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must congratulate ourselves on the positive impact of this policy, which has proved crucial to the harmonious development of the Union. Having said that, a great deal still remains to be done. I believe our objective should be to make this policy simpler, more intelligent and more generous. By more intelligent, I mean that this policy must be flexible and take account of the wide variety of handicaps facing the European regions. We need to define clearer allocation criteria and set achievable objectives. In this regard, the GDP statistics have a clear advantage. This, however, is a simplistic solution, which can only be partial, and which does not allow for adaptation to all the realities in the field. We must take account of other indicators that are just as relevant and quantifiable, such as accessibility, public infrastructures and employment rates. This approach would enable us to develop a cohesion policy that benefits regions whose development is lagging behind, but which is also suited to mountainous regions, sparsely populated regions, and regions with geographical handicaps.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regional policy must also be simpler. That means that its beneficiaries must be able to use it easily. Together with Commissioner Barnier and the Member States, we have started to work towards this, but the current exercise is restricted by the framework set by the regulations in force. We must do more to simplify the administrative framework after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is to make cohesion policy more generous. Today, fund absorption capacity is often used to justify restrictions on subsidies that are granted. I believe that after 2006, if we succeed in coming up with instruments suited to local needs that are easy to use, the budget for these can and should be greater. The problem is not that there is one cake to be shared between regions, as some would have us believe. The Union must show ambition for the sake of all its citizens when it comes to showing that it is an area of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The RETT committee amendments are in line with the conclusions of the Musotto report, particularly on the need for a cohesion policy which will improve existing and future disparities between European regions in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would highlight and support Amendment 12 which recognises the need for a generous phasing-out period for those regions which may no longer qualify for Objective 1 support but which may still need this level of funding. My own peripheral region has received only 10% of all EU funding to Ireland over the past 30 years and is therefore still seriously under-developed in terms of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, support paragraph 16, nor part of paragraph 17. I believe they could lead to a by-passing of national government responsibilities and duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the context of enlargement, the EU must ensure adequate aid for family farmers – the backbone of our rural communities – and, in addition, specific aid to young farmers to ensure the survival of our rural communities and our agricultural sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the last person to speak, I can say that. Regional policy is extremely important for today’s EU, but also in terms of solidarity in the EU of the future. The closer we get to 2007, the more intensive are the discussions in our regions of what the future will entail. I can confirm that there is a lot of concern in the regions about what will happen regarding future structural policy. As the Commission’s reports show, we still have problems, for example with unemployment and wider gulfs between city areas and other regions that are lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make effective use of currently available resources, something which also applies to future structural fund budgets. That is why it is important to have partnerships, substantial regional influence on how the money is used and a simplification of administrative methods so that red tape does not prevent the regions from making good use of the money.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the excellent things about the report is the emphasis it places upon the fact that geographically disadvantaged regions must be given priority in the structural funds of the future. We know that a very great many regions are very far away from the large markets and have to live with that geographical fact. I also think that Amendment No 10 from my own group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, is extremely important, pointing out as it does that indicators other than GDP must govern the use of the structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to emphasise how important it is for <span class="italic">all</span> the policy areas to promote regional development. If they do not do so, regional policy will be ineffectual. Agricultural policy, especially transport policy, must promote regional equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
