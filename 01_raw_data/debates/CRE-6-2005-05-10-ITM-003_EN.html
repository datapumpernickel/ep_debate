<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, my first word is a word of thanks to your rapporteur, who has carried out some truly excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent wave of terrorist attacks has demonstrated that no country or business sector is immune to such threats. Whatever their motives may be, these terrorist acts can occur in any place, at any time. The maritime world and port environment do not escape such threats, and we cannot wait for an attack before we take what are essentially preventative measures within the transport policy framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental objective of this proposal for a directive is to complete, at port level, the measures adopted in 2004 exclusively on port terminals, within the context of the regulations regarding the security of ships and port facilities. You will recall that this regulation transposes, at Community level, the security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in December 2002, particularly the ISPS code on the security of ships and port facilities. At that time, the Commission had chosen to extend the security measures to the entire port area only at a later stage and by means of a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final objective is to emerge from this near artificial separation between the port, on the one hand, and the port facilities that make up the port, on the other, and to implement a coherent security plan that takes into account the geography and the topography of different ports, as well as the various areas of which it is composed, on a case-by-case basis, according to the Member States’ transposition. We believe that this approach is viable in terms of efficiency and cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that our proposal is largely based on the results of a piece of work carried out jointly by the International Labour Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, which has led to the publication of a code of conduct on port security. This code of conduct is not, however, legally binding. That is why the Commission’s proposal requires the same structures and security measures as the regulation already in force, in order to create a security regime that applies to maritime transport as a whole, starting with ships and extending as far as the port area.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach enables procedures and synergies to be simplified where security is concerned. The proposed directive calls on Member States to define the confines of their ports and to ensure that port security assessments and port security plans are drafted in an appropriate manner, and in accordance with minimum requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal submitted before you also makes provision for a port security authority to be designated for each individual port or group of ports, a port security officer to be appointed, and focal points to be set up in Member States in order to ensure that the necessary communication takes place with other Member States and, of course, with the Commission. Finally, the proposal makes provision for a Community-wide system of inspections of the implementation of port security measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude my speech, Mr President, by stressing in particular that some of our major trade partners have already carried out an extensive implementation of the International Maritime Organisation’s ISPS-code. These third countries enforce the security measures in all of their ports and naturally expect the same commitment from us. They are all set to come and check that that is the case if we do not move more quickly in this direction. I believe that the European Union cannot be outdone in this area, both for reasons of trade but also for the protection, naturally, of our fellow European citizens and of such vital infrastructures as our ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that, when I travelled to the United States last month, I was able to visit Mr Jackson, who is responsible for national security. To be perfectly frank, we have really initiated a form of cooperation based on trust. That also implies, however, that Europeans are truly willing to consent to the efforts required to ensure this large-scale security effort across all port facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore once again thank your rapporteur and all those who have examined this text. I thank you, in particular, for conferring on this document the full importance that it deserves and, Mr President, Minister, I hope for your speedy agreement on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the airports, it is now, of course, the turn of the seaports; after all, European ports are essential links within the transport chain which connect trade and passenger flows by sea and across the land. In many cases, they are also the nerve centres for the transhipment of dangerous freight for important chemical and petrochemical production centres and are located near cities. It follows that terrorist attacks in ports can lead to serious disruptions of transport systems, have a domino effect and cause damage to people in the ports and to those living in the vicinity. It was, quite simply, vital that action be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that it is better to sort this matter out ourselves than to be on the receiving end of unsolicited help from American inspection teams, to name but one example. As Commissioner Barrot indicated a moment ago, first of all, Regulation 725 transposed the Code on international ship and port facility security – the ISPS Code – into rules that are binding upon the EU. This Regulation is not all-embracing, though. Since it is only concerned with the security of the wet section of the port, an additional directive on the regulation of the security of the entire port area came out in 2004. That is the directive that is before us this morning and on which we will be voting later on today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on two core issues to which I was committed as the rapporteur. Commissioner Barrot has already discussed a number of other issues at great length. The two issues I should like to discuss are related to guaranteeing a level playing field in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the proposal’s financial underpinning. Who is actually paying for what? The differences between some Member States and others are considerable, and I see this as completely undesirable if there is to be a level playing field. In the final agreement, the Commission is therefore urged to present – as soon as possible and by no later than 30 June 2006 – a study about the distribution of the costs between government bodies, port authorities and industry. The additional security measures should on no account lead to distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was determined that the interpretation of the rules in all Member States should be unambiguous and that their implementation should be harmonised. It is, of course, unacceptable that one Member State should settle for one extra lock, so to speak, while five guards and six cameras should be made compulsory in the others. Of course, I am exaggerating, but still. I have therefore argued in favour of the Commission ‘metamonitoring’ to some degree. This proved to be a tricky point during the negotiations, particularly for the Council, which surprises me, because it is the Member States that complain bitterly about the lack of a level playing field, but all is well that ends well. We have found a phrase with which all those involved can identify and by means of which the Commission is given sufficient means in order to carry out the necessary metamonitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have also tried my level best to avoid creating an additional bureaucratic institution, and proposals to that end have consequently been repealed. I am, of course, delighted to inform you that I reached agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission very recently. This compromise is made up of Amendments 13 to 75, inclusive, which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and my own group can support, as can also the Council and the Commission. If we actually adopt this compromise later on today, the directive can be finalised at first reading. Although you may be inclined to be sympathetic to Amendments 10, 11 and 12, tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would nevertheless advise you to vote against them. They failed to pass muster at an earlier stage in the Committee on Transport and Tourism; and their substance has already been covered elsewhere or would lead to an unnecessary Christmas tree effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that has now been reached is a very workable compromise for all parties involved in the implementation of the measures, and so a speedy conclusion at first reading is very much to be desired. There is nothing left to say but to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency warmly for their commitment and their cooperation, which I have greatly appreciated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all I would like to express our broad support for this proposal and in particular welcome the flexibility contained therein, so far as Member States and their implementation is concerned. Security and counter-terrorism measures are very much a feature of the age in which we live and are very important issues, so it is all the more welcome that the Commissioner has taken an initiative in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my committee had some concerns about the lack of a proper cost benefit analysis, or an adequate impact assessment of the costs arising from this directive. We also had concern about the absence in the proposal of any specific reference to funding or financing measures. It is all very well for us to come forward with proposals, but we should have regard as to how such proposals are to be financed. Therefore, we tabled an amendment, which draws attention to these aspects of the proposal and calls for them to be borne in mind by the Member States when they draw up the guidelines for action. We would not wish all the burden of the cost of this measure to fall on operators or shippers in the private sector, but would seek a fair and equitable sharing of the burdens and costs involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I nonetheless think it necessary to add some points: the ease and confidence with which the terrorists were able to strike in September 2001 and in other circumstances have created the need to extend security checks not only at airports and border points but also at ports, which record a significant flow of goods and passengers on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal of the Council and Parliament to additionally subject cargo ferries to checks, I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, take the liberty of pointing out that a greater number of checks at ports would also make it possible to stem the trade in counterfeit goods, drugs trafficking and a long list of activities carried out by criminal organisations. My proposal, presented as an amendment in the Committee on Civil Liberties, was not accepted, in the same way that other amendments calling for the extension of checks to people, in addition to goods and vehicles, were not accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe this rejection to be incomprehensible, given that the objective was exclusively that of further safeguarding the safety of our citizens. Fortunately, subsequent discussions between the Council and Parliament confirmed the legitimacy of my argument and took note of it. The content of my amendments was added to the text, so that they have, in essence, been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the directive can also act as a legitimate tool in the fight against illegal immigration, by restricting the entry of people who, arriving without jobs or any papers, and counting on straightforward social integration, very often are compelled to commit crimes in order to survive, sometimes even despite themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that we are, I hope, bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion is testimony to her hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the threat from terrorism over the last few years has increased considerably. The House has rightly debated these issues many times recently.</p>
<p class="contents">My original concerns were that the Commission’s proposals were too vague, would go too far and that the considerable costs of implementing and enforcing this directive could be pushed down the supply chain, leading to increased costs to industry and the consumer. I agree very much with Mr Chichester’s comments on the cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the hard work of the rapporteur, such vague phrases as ‘unlawful acts’ – which could mean anything, such as dropping litter in a port area which poses no real threat to security – have been amended to read ‘security incidents’. This tightens the meaning of the phrasing and ensures that the directive can be better targeted at real threats. Port areas have been better defined to limit the costs imposed on the supply chain outside the geographic area of the port. Importantly, the principle of subsidiarity has been promoted in terms of defining the port-related areas to which the directive will apply.</p>
<p class="contents">However, security is not just about money and, indeed, cannot have a price put upon it. The hard work of the rapporteur has meant that the potentially unnecessary bureaucracy has been addressed. I am pleased to say that we have a report that I fully support and I would ask the House to give it its full backing in the vote later today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, since 2002 and with the specific provisions of 2004, the issue has no longer been seen merely in terms of protecting human life at sea and environmental impact, but also of preventing terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">An improvement in the situation is, however, necessary, given that vessels are often not allowed to load and unload at US ports, and – particularly as regards container ships – the ports have to reach an agreement with the US customs agency under penalty of exclusion from transport routes. That does not aid our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The security rules that already apply, as cited by Mr Barrot, moreover, are fragmented, they are not legally binding and they lack an overall picture. It would therefore seem fundamental to approve this regulatory framework, in order to prevent distortion of competition and to recognise ports as nodal points in the logistical chain. The contribution made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to the drafting of the overall proposals was aimed in the following two directions: defining ports in the transport sector – not only at the ship/port interface, but acknowledging their functional link with the common transport policy – and asserting the need for inspections by the Commission to guarantee a uniform framework, while respecting the Member States’ authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the considerable disparity between the positions of the Council and the Commission at the outset, and whilst we are making do with a less ambitious outcome than we would have hoped for, we consider the compromise reached to be satisfactory and we vote in favour. I sincerely thank the rapporteur for her fine ability to listen and synthesise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A burgeoning number of documents that deal with problems relating to port security could well result in a proliferation of bureaucratic structures, and EU regulation of this issue will mean that two overlapping sets of legislation and legal systems will be in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity is one of the Community’s founding principles. We must not deprive the Member States of yet more powers by declaring that the directive will also apply to areas outside ports. We must not impose constraints on the Member States’ judicial systems by dictating what is to be considered an offence and what is to be considered unlawful. I am all for enhancing port security, but wherever possible it should be the Member States and the ports themselves that decide how this goal is to be achieved, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. The effect of this directive must not be that ports have to undergo never-ending inspections, carried out by countless different bodies. As I said at the beginning of my speech, we must avoid over-bureaucratisation of the regulations, directives and laws that apply in the EU concerning this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The attacks in New York, Washington and Madrid have shown that no mode of transport is yet safe from terrorism, and it is therefore logical that seaport security should be stepped up. Commissioner Barrot pointed out a moment ago that by doing so, we are simply discharging a number of international obligations. In fact, this is not just about the threat of terrorism, but also about the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and the trade in drugs and fake goods. We hope in any event that the initiative will not remain stuck in good intentions, but that each of these security concerns will be acted upon properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my approval about the amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

I think we have here a sensible compromise ready for tomorrow’s vote, one that all the groups can support, and that will bring this matter to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">The world is not, alas, the way we would like it to be. There have been terrorist attacks, which endanger the transport of persons and goods. Something must be done about them, and that is what this directive attempts to do; the upshot is that we have to take preventive action. One point that has to be made in this context, though, is that responsibility for security cannot, ultimately, be passed on to the ports alone; this is, on the contrary, a task for all those involved in transport, and that is something we must not forget. Security begins with the person loading on the goods, and it must, ultimately, involve both road and rail, or else we will end up with distortions of competition and with something else that we do not want, in the shape of more traffic on the roads rather than on water. This, I think, has to be taken into account. Unless I am mistaken, the Commission has already started giving consideration as to how this aspect may be included. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This applies to both the ship-quay relationship and to the other port sections. Since ports are not identical in terms of size, location, character and method or organisation, Member States are given scope to decide how best to implement these rules, rightly so. I applaud the fact that the Member States can implement those rules in the most appropriate manner. After all, a uniform regulation for all ports prejudices the diversity to which I referred and will push up costs.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point is the enforcement of those rules. Experience elsewhere has taught us that enforcement is easier in theory than in practice. Limited manpower is no ingredient for quality inspection, and so I welcome the fact that the Commission closely monitors the implementation of this directive.</p>

There was some controversy within my group over issues such as funding for institutions with competences in the field, and inspections and whether or not they disrupt port operations. I believe the compromise we reached is a good one, and that it deserves our support.</p>

We are well aware that there is a cost issue and, as regards the costs liable to be generated by these measures, we in fact plan to undertake the commitment to prepare a communication on the security of different transport methods, including the issue of their financing, in our 2005 work programme. The concerns of your Parliament will be taken into consideration in this way. This reference to financing is, moreover, included in a preamble.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out to those who fear that we are not taking specific national situations into consideration that this is a directive and not a regulation. This enables us to take into consideration, by way of subsidiarity, a number of practical considerations that will make the fight for security more effective, when the directive is transposed by Member States. Finally, I should like to say to Mr Piecyk that he is absolutely right and that we must also be concerned about safety throughout the transport chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I now return to you, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, to express my deepest thanks as, thanks to you, I believe that we will be in a position to gain time in the context of implementing these security rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank your committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism. You have embraced this rather technical proposal and you have adopted a pragmatic and constructive approach in your handling of the dossier. I am pleased to observe that there are a great many points on which Parliament, the Commission and the Council fundamentally agree, with regard to the measures to be taken. The Commission can therefore subscribe to the compromise reached by Parliament in the context of negotiations with the Council and which is expressed, Madam President, in Amendments 13-75. We can therefore endorse Amendments 13-75, but unfortunately not Amendments 1-12.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to express my wish for a decision to be taken in order that this directive can be speedily adopted. As I said, the European Union cannot economise on preventative measures for the protection of its ports either with regard to its people and sectors of port activity or with regard to its international partners. All of the above has, moreover, been extremely well put by a number of you. Madam President, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, ladies and gentlemen, my services will pass on to you the detailed position of the Commission on each proposed amendment.
