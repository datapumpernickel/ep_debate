When the Cartagena Protocol was successfully negotiated in 2000, this was a significant success for the European Union. It was also a success for all those of us who want free trade to be conducted in the context of environmental concern and respect for consumers. The protocol clarifies the conditions for global trade involving genetically-modified products. To date, 49 countries have ratified the protocol. It is only necessary for one country to ratify the protocol for it to come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft law we are now to debate lays down EU rules for the export of genetically-modified organisms. In adopting these rules, the European Union fulfils the requirements laid down in the Cartagena Protocol. These new rules are coming at precisely the right time, and they may perhaps also serve as a model and inspiration for states that are working on their regulations right now. Compared with the proposal tabled by the Commission, the rules we are to adopt tomorrow are a little stricter and clearer. They are more in line with what is laid down in the protocol and, in certain areas, go still further.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament, we have focused on tightening up the proposal in certain key areas. We have made sure that rules and definitions shall not be looser than what is laid down by the protocol and that express approval by the country of import shall always be required before the export takes place. The draft law now makes this crystal-clear, explaining that the absence of a response from the country of import may never be viewed as ‘silent consent’. The legislation of the country of import must always be respected. The proposal makes it clear that we must not export anything from the EU that is not permitted within the EU and that there must be considerable transparency, with the public being given information about the export taking place. The proposal also makes it plain that responsibilities must be clearly distributed so that it is the actual exporter who gives notice of the export.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the text we are now to adopt means that the European Parliament has obtained a hearing for approximately 80% of what we wanted to get through at first reading. We have also discussed this proposal with the Council of Ministers. COREPER has already adopted the text we are to adopt tomorrow. In this way, we can avoid conciliation, and the legislation will be ready when the protocol comes into force globally. That has been possible thanks to a significant consensus between the Council of Ministers and Parliament. There has also been a clear willingness to compromise and a shared desire on the part of the political groups to work quickly. This has happened following constructive cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, whom I would thank, one and all. We have also had very close cooperation firstly with the Danish and then with the Greek Presidencies. They too deserve thanks, and the same applies to those with responsibility at the Commission’s Environment Directorate-General, who have been of very great help.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting these rules, we show that environmental considerations and respect for developing countries’ legislation are key concepts for the EU’s view of the global trade in genetically-modified products. There is a need to do this at the very time when the United States is pushing for issues of this kind to be resolved within the World Trade Organisation. We have recently seen examples of how this country has dumped genetically-modified food in countries that do not permit such food in their own national legislation. This shows very clearly how important it is for the EU to adopt rules right now that indicate a more responsible, credible and long-term approach to these complex and very controversial issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, the proposal on the table today is linked to the recent ratification by the European Community of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The overall purpose, as we have heard already, of this United Nations agreement is to establish common rules to be followed in transboundary movements of GMOs in order to protect biodiversity and human health at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has to fulfil its international obligations, which means transposing into our own legislation the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol. This is the objective of the proposal we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already expressed its reservations on some political points of this procedure, particularly since the common position agreed in the first reading goes well beyond the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol on a substantial number of issues. Despite its reservations, the Commission is willing to cooperate on the basis of the package of compromise amendments we have on the table today, in order to increase the chances of reaching agreement at the second reading. Therefore, in a spirit of compromise, the Commission will not oppose the package. However, the Commission still believes that it might have been better to adhere more closely to the provisions of the protocol in order not to impose an excessive burden on Community exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission considers that it is important to progress swiftly in order to have the implementing legislation adopted before the protocol enters into force. This will be soon, as Mr Sjöstedt said, since 49 countries have already ratified it and the deposit of 50 instruments of ratification is required for its entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the European Union has been a key player in these international negotiations from the very beginning. I remember this vividly since that is what I had to start with as a new Commissioner. We need to send a clear signal that we intend to honour our commitments and be in a position to fully implement the protocol as soon as it enters into force, which should now be a matter of months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in a position to support the package of amendments submitted for the approval of the Parliament as part of a compromise. The package consists of Amendment Nos 19-26. Let me just comment briefly on some of the amendments from the package to illustrate the Commission's position.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 does recognise the need to respect the party or non-party of imports that can be regulated by your safety framework, consistent with the protocol. This is in line with the position taken on numerous occasions by the Commission in international forums, which is to respect the right of countries to a free informed choice with regard to GMOs. So the Commission can accept Amendment No 19.</p>
<p class="contents">It can accept Amendments Nos 24-26 on improved public access to information regarding transboundary movements of GMOs, which is in line with the general framework of public access to environmental information and with Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 21 and 22 impose an obligation to wait for prior written consent before proceeding with the export of GMOs. The Commission believes that this goes beyond the Biosafety Protocol and is also the only amendment in the package about which the Commission had some serious reservations. However, as part of the overall compromise, the Commission can agree to both amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to say that Parliament has worked in a swift and transparent manner in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council. Once again, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for his efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, my thanks are due equally to the Commission, the Danish and of course particularly the current Greek Presidency, which worked with great commitment to achieve a compromise between the Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all keen to avoid a conciliation procedure for this report, for it deals, after all, with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the protection of biological diversity, which is a subject close to everyone's heart. The European Union was indeed a key player in the negotiations on the Cartagena Protocol. This makes it all the more important to transpose the Protocol swiftly into Community law now, thus sending out a clear political signal of our continued commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority of the draft before us is to find a solution, which has eluded us until now, to the issue of EU exports of living GMOs to third countries. Here, practicability must be the key imperative. We must achieve realistic legislation that can be applied in practice. This is why I am pleased that the Council has not incorporated, in this regulation, a number of amendments proposed at first reading, for example on the inclusion of aids. These amendments aimed to intervene in pending legislative processes through this report on the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol. By 'pending legislative processes', I mean the legislation on genetically-modified food and feed, their labelling and traceability. We debated and voted on this matter at second reading in committee just two weeks ago. The outcome was very close; opinions diverge widely and it still remains to be seen how the plenary will finally vote in July. It would therefore be quite wrong to try to anticipate the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">A vote on the environmental liability regulation has only just taken place at first reading as well. A final decision on this issue is certainly not yet in sight. For this reason, any statement on the liability issue in connection with traceability of GMOs and aids in the current report on transboundary movement had to be emphatically rejected. These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law. However, relevant amendments from the first reading did not make it to this second reading either.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council has decided in principle to adopt my amendments on exemptions to the system of notification and information for GMOs in transit and in closed systems. We really do need these exemptions to ensure that there are no impediments to research. The Council has also made it clear that the so-called Advanced Informed Agreement procedure set out in the Cartagena Protocol should only apply to first movements. Conversely, this provides an exemption to the information procedure for GMO exports to a third country, if this third country has already given approval to another country for the import of the same GMO. These exemption provisions are necessary since the AIA procedure, as the information procedure in this case, does not promise any enhanced safety and would simply obstruct transboundary movement unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the report before us, with all the compromises that we have drafted, is good and viable, and would ask all of you to vote for all the compromise amendments. This will set us on the right course and avoid a lengthy conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Sjöstedt has shown considerable openness and a very great desire to achieve results, but I also think that the Commission and the Council – during both the Danish and Greek Presidencies – have made very positive contributions so that we can now avoid protracted discussion in the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now obtaining a high level of protection in relation to the rules for the export of GMOs from the EU. I think that the developing countries, in particular, are well protected. They are in the position of being able to exercise genuine choice in connection with the import of GMO products, even though they may of course be thought to be exposed to quite aggressive marketing from parts of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">By far the majority of Parliament’s amendments have been accepted, and this means we can have the Catagena Protocol put into effect without its wording being weakened for political reasons – on the contrary, with the wording of the protocol being tightened up in certain respects. This means, for example – and I see this as the most important thing of all – that there can be no export of GMOs without the express consent of the country of import. It is not enough that there should be no reaction, and this cannot be interpreted as tacit consent. Express consent is also required, something that I think has been quite crucial in these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the result makes an important contribution to the overall complex of laws that we shall now soon have on the subject of GMOs and that are designed to protect our health but, above all, to protect biodiversity, even though the ability genetically to manipulate the products of nature has opened the way for doing so. This is, however, a constructive contribution to the overall picture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when GMOs are the subject of intense debate, not only in Europe but throughout the world, it is vital that we can agree on at least some aspects of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the most important points in this report are the requirement for prior written express consent of the importing country before any movement of GMOs can take place, an obligation on the Commission to make export notifications available to the public and the requirement on Member States to prevent accidental cross-boundary movement of GMOs – the latter addressing the major debate of the moment, coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are talking about implementing the Cartegena Protocol, which covers the export of GMOs to countries outside the EU. The protocol, as others have said, will enter into force when ratified by 50 countries. I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that 49 countries, plus the European Community, have already done so. As eight Member States have been awaiting adoption of this regulation, a positive vote tomorrow will lead almost directly to the Cartegena Protocol coming into force. This will have a significant impact, particularly on the poorest countries, allowing them the choice of whether or not to accept GMOs, the very choice that we want for people everywhere, including those people forced to depend on aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been very sad if no consensus had been reached on such an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lund has already mentioned, the Council initially agreed unanimously that the exporters must have the approval of the importing country before they undertake the first transboundary movement. However, in order to meet the Commission halfway, the Council and the Parliament then voted in favour of the requirement for this approval to be provided in writing prior to the first transboundary export of a GMO.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also possible to reach a consensus between the Parliament, the Council and the Committee with regard to the exporters' notification documents. The exporter is required, for a period of a minimum of five years, to keep a record of the notification and the acknowledgement of receipt from the competent authority of the importing country. He is also obliged to forward these documents to the authority of the Member State from which the GMO is exported and to the Commission. The Commission then makes these documents available to the public in compliance with the European regulations on access to environmental information.</p>
<p class="contents">This new-found consensus between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission will, I believe, give the public the opportunity to be informed at all times about everything that happens. I am certainly convinced that these provisions will be effective. I hope very much that this new European regulation will overcome much of the public's mistrust of GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not underestimate the significance of the step forward that we will take tomorrow when we vote on it in Parliament. It will bring all the EU countries into compliance with the Cartegena Protocol and enable them to go forward and ratify it. The ratifications will bring the protocol into force. There would then be further countries of the world quickly coming forward to ratify it, to ensure that they are present next April at the first conference of the parties that will turn the Cartegena Protocol into a reality in terms of an international trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome that. It is an excellent step forward. It demonstrates how we can introduce the new technology of genetic modification. We can control it, use it, put the products in the market place and give people choices, wherever they are in the world, whether they are rich or poor.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report because it will show us a way forward. There remains only one last piece in the jigsaw of legislation within the EU needed to implement the proper control and use of GMOs, which is the traceability in labelling legislation that we hope to bring before Parliament next month.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a pragmatic and sensible way forward. This is a way in which we can use these new technologies and implement them to the benefit of all. I hope we can take lessons from what we do tomorrow when we deal with further legislation next month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation is a great success. It means that the eight remaining Member States yet to ratify the Protocol can now begin the process. The Protocol will therefore come into force very soon, marking the start of a new era in international environmental law, an era of international genetic technology law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Biosafety<span class="italic"> </span>Protocol is the first international treaty to regulate genetic technology, and it does so explicitly and exclusively. It is to be hoped that the voices still raised to dispute that there is any difference between genetically-modified and conventionally bred organisms will at last fall silent.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has greatly improved the regulation before us on numerous points, often in exemplary cooperation with the Council. On many key points, the regulation goes far beyond what is required by the Biosafety Protocol itself. The fact that all groups support the compromise reached is therefore encouraging and a hopeful sign for the implementation of future environmental agreements.</p>

Everything has already been said, but not yet by everyone. I shall therefore follow everyone else's lead and express my warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work and positive cooperation. I would also like to congratulate him on his excellent substantive work, as well as on his great sensitivity during the negotiations, which enabled us to achieve a compromise among the parliamentary groups and among the European institutions. I think that is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said repeatedly here today that the speedy entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol is naturally an issue that is close to everyone's hearts. However, I do not want to pass up the opportunity to express my great regret that the largest exporter of genetically-modified organisms, namely the United States, again remains outside the frame on such a key issue, where global multilateral regulations are essential. We face a major political challenge, that of convincing our counterparts in the United States of the need for such regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is also a great success. In substantive terms, the Council endorsed almost 70 per cent of the position adopted by Parliament at first reading. I note with satisfaction, especially as rapporteur for genetically-modified food and feed, that there is clearly something of a tradition here, with the Council generally following Parliament's position. I hope that the vote tomorrow will be a major step towards the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
