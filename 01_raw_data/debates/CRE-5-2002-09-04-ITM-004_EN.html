<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenzel (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, 11 September is almost upon us, the first anniversary of that day when two aircraft, piloted by terrorists belonging to al—Qa’ida, crashed into the World Trade Centre, caused both towers to collapse, killed thousands of people and, at a stroke, changed the world – or, at least so we thought at the time. There have indeed been changes. Under UN mandate, an alliance against terrorism was forged. For the first time, a crisis was declared to be a matter for NATO, Article 5 of whose Treaty was invoked. The American President Bush called for the head of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi billionaire who headed up the al—Qa’ida network, and the war against terrorism met with its first significant success in Afghanistan itself, where the fundamentalist Taliban regime, which was generally inhumane and in particular hostile to women, was driven from power and an interim government under President Karzai, which is putting down democratic roots, was established. One year on, we are of course all aware that the struggle against terrorism, as President Bush himself once said, will be a long one at various levels, and that quick victories are illusory.</p>
<p class="contents">In Afghanistan itself, the Karzai government enjoys de facto power only in Kabul. The authority of the various provincial rulers belonging to different tribes is undiminished, and has, in some instances, even been reinforced, a fact demonstrated just as much by the murder of Commander Massoud as by the murder of Afghanistan's Vice-President Abdul Qadir, who had incurred the enmity of rival drug baron, supporters of Osama Bin Laden and of the Taliban, but possibly also of members of the Northern Alliance who had felt themselves bypassed. It is also far from clear whether or not Osama Bin Laden is still alive.</p>
<p class="contents">What is beyond doubt is that the al—Qa’ida network has regenerated itself and reorganised both its guerrilla organisation, which is active not only in the neighbouring Pakistan, and also its sources of finance, which continue to flow in abundance. Anyone reading today's <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span> will find a sobering report on the transfers of gold to Sudan through channels running from Pakistan and Iran. This means that the al—Qa’ida network and the Taliban militias still have large reserves of finance at their disposal, derived from the cultivation and sale of opium. Set against the sums involved here, the aid given by the European Union towards stabilising the situation in Afghanistan looks rather modest, even though the EU has become the largest donor of funds for this purpose. There is no doubt that we have to do this in order to bring peace to this country once under Soviet Communist occupation and ravaged by decades of civil war and thus make a contribution to consolidating the crisis region between Pakistan, Iran, India and the unstable Asiatic part of the former Soviet Union. We also have to do it for reasons of self-protection. Europe is a destination not only for Afghan drugs, but also for illegal immigrants, in the number of whom there has been a significant increase on the borders between the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria over the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, then, a need for humanitarian aid just as much as for targeted measures in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a fight we will certainly have to carry on for a long time yet, and one in which we can expect no quick victories. Yet do it we must, if we are to demonstrate to the USA that we are to be taken seriously as a partner in an alliance against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with the USA in the aftermath of 11 September have, to put it mildly, been beset by irritations. We are both saddened – Europeans when America goes it alone, and the USA by the European Union's lack of political unity and its military weakness, both exemplified by the EU's line on Iraq, which has to date been less than coherent. Also symptomatic of this are the USA's threatening gestures directed at Baghdad, which are not always credible.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed on both sides of the Atlantic is coherent crisis management combating not only the symptoms of international terrorism, but also and especially its causes, as rightly demanded by the former White House security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Developing such a strategy to pull the plug on the crises in the Middle East, settle the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and neutralise Islamic political fundamentalism wherever it rears its head – and it has its boltholes in Europe itself – to all these things, the European Union can and must make a substantial contribution. EU aid in Afghanistan is an essential building block in this.</p>

<p class="contents">It was as early as the International Women's Day in 1998 that European women started the ‘Flower for the Women of Kabul’ campaign, and deplored the human rights violations that excluded women in particular from education, medical treatment, work and political involvement. Another six years of the Taliban's despotic rule had gone by before things began to look up for democracy. The international anti-terror alliance then laid the spectre of the Taliban to rest. Democracy movements were launched at once, and the EU again played an active part in this on the Petersberg in Bonn. At the same time, albeit attracting almost no attention, the first Afghan Women's Summit was meeting in Brussels at the invitation of European women. It was there, for the first time and after two decades without political involvement, that it was possible for Afghan women, whether living in exile or in Afghanistan itself, to have their own forum and find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">International pressure made it possible for women to be first admitted to the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span> and subsequently to participate in the new transitional government. In the meantime, we saw to it that the Budget included funds to help the women make up a great deal of lost ground, and that it was again possible for self-help organisations such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) to receive support from Budget funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with consternation that we now hear it reported that the first schools for girls are being closed down again, that fundamentalists again want to force women out of public life, and that the political influence of women ministers is being curbed. All the political influence at our disposal must now be brought to bear in order to prevent the situation of women worsening still further and above all to ensure that aid reaches rural areas and is passed on to women.</p>
<p class="contents">Jointly with the women on the European Council, we had taken the initiative of setting up a multinational group of women observers to ensure that women get the aid they need. Believing as I do that this fire must be kept alight, I now urgently call upon the Commission to continue to focus on the situation of women, and urge that we combat the principal evil, which is poverty and illiteracy among women. Even if world public opinion concentrates on other issues, I do think that we should continue to focus on Afghanistan and that we have to maintain a local presence there. My group, the Group of Social Democrats, will be sending a delegation to Afghanistan, and I look to the Commission to provide support for it in the shape of logistical aid. The threat of war in Iraq would destroy much that has been achieved, and so all our efforts are needed to help make peace in the region.</p>

<p class="contents">The Afghanistan debate covers two matters: the current issue of the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and the longer term question of the situation itself in that troubled country. With regard to the alleged war crimes, we must now await the outcome of the UN investigation. If the investigation shows that war crimes have been committed, the people responsible must be found and prosecuted in accordance with the current regulations. There is really nothing more to be said about that matter at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been very encouraging to hear the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner report now on developments in Afghanistan less than a year after the country lay in ruins. We can be pleased with the Bonn process and proud of the aid provided by the EU to that poverty-stricken country. We have in fact heard today about an EU success story in rebuilding a country, and we should thank the Commission in particular for its persistent efforts. We also know that we are only in the first phase, that there is a long way to go and that the new administration, or transitional government, is subject to both external and internal threats. Although much reduced in size, al-Qa’ida is still an external threat from hiding places in the regions bordering Afghanistan. Internally, the fact that warlords clearly continue to operate, are still behind the cultivation of opium poppies and are in a position to threaten the stability of Afghanistan is necessarily a source of concern. It is a threat to the country’s integrity and to Mr Karzai’s government, which is the best guarantee of a peaceful process of development involving the implementation of those values we cherish. We must therefore continue to maintain a close dialogue with the transitional government, as well as engage in close dialogue with any government resulting from the 2004 elections. Prompt and effective efforts on the part of the EU must be followed up by long-term efforts. The fact that the EU has just launched the ‘Water for Life’ initiative is commendably in line with what we have previously heard in this Chamber. Unlike almost all crops, opium poppies do not require much water. So let the EU supply water to Afghanistan, show responsibility and contribute to a more peaceful world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Commissioner Patten: it is not enthusiasm that is needed – although a little would not go amiss – but solutions, and these solutions must not be the <span class="italic">Danse macabre</span> being performed by Mr Bush and Mr Sharon or Osama Bin Laden and <span class="italic">Hamas</span>, who are destroying people, nature and human and social rights. The conflict between forces of good and evil is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, and it undermines the rule of law. The Taliban have been defeated but their ideology lives on: many of their practices, with which those in power today are not unfamiliar, remain.</p>
<p class="contents">The refugees are returning home but they are given no support, schools are reopening but schoolgirls have been the victims of a bomb attack, cinemas are reopening but they are banned from showing Indian films because they contain women without veils, women are banned from singing on the radio or television, rape and violence are common occurrences, the lethal, lucrative opium trade continues, and, although reconstruction is taking place – and it is a slow process – Afghanistan is in danger of forfeiting its sovereignty to money and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">For this and many other reasons, our economic and social aid must be provided swiftly and effectively to allow the establishment of the structures and infrastructure of a rule of law and to empower that part of civil society – particularly women – which is completely devoted to securing freedom, justice, development and peace for all men and women. The situation in Afghanistan is tragic and we must continue to help the country in the knowledge that there is a universal need for sovereignty and that there must be an end to war in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We showed far too little concern for Afghanistan’s reconstruction, and failed to put conflict prevention in place by reconstructing society there. We should, of course, not make the same mistake twice.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghan society is complex due to its many factions, tribes, and religious and ethnic differences. The different cultures must be integrated and Afghanistan, a country that has probably always been heavily militarised, and certainly still is, must be told once again that the rule of law cannot grow out of the barrel of a gun. Fundamentalism has certainly not died out in Afghanistan’s society, but we must make the return of refugees possible by planning our programmes well and by guaranteeing maximum participation by the population, including women. We must set this as a pre-condition, for if they are only given funding and are able to go back to shrouding women in burkas and confining them to the home, something is very wrong. The economy must be developed, and the mines must be cleared in order to restore the countryside to its former state. All of this will require a great deal of expenditure and, above all, patience. Given that gangsterism is so prevalent, we should not be surprised to come across renewed armed fighting between the factions from time to time. This is why I would underline the need to safeguard human rights. We must ensure that nothing goes unpunished, and that enquiries are definitely mounted into any crimes against humanity. We might be able to help the United Nations in this endeavour, so that their moral prestige is also shored up financially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in all our efforts to help construct a better Afghanistan we should not lose sight of why we are now involved there with such commitment. It is, of course, to root out terrorism, to help build a peaceable, well-disposed, durable and better society and to ensure that the extremists do not set down fresh roots either within the country or elsewhere. All our actions should be measured against these yardsticks and we should be under no illusions about the fragility of the situation, which poses major challenges both for ISAF and the other coalition forces operating within the country. There is now wider agreement about the desirability of ISAF broadening its mandate beyond Kabul. This is not just a matter of the availability of suitable international forces but, as Commission Patten has said, it also tests the willingness of reluctant local warlords, often backed by foreign interests in the region, to comply with the authority of Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish armed forces are to be congratulated on the satisfactory completion of the first half of their span of command of ISAF. The building of a professional and reliable Afghan army and police force, which is happening in parallel largely under American, British and French auspices, will take time and there seems little doubt that ISAF will have to continue its operations next year and an early indication of the follow-on command arrangements is needed. The last thing we need, when action against Iraq is in the air, is uncertainty about military arrangements in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight three particular aspects of the situation: refugees, EU funding and the landmine issue. Firstly, refugees, which Mr Haarder touched on earlier. There is now a degree of security in Afghanistan. Yet, while many refugees have returned to the country, millions remain in Iran and Pakistan. Some talk about two or three million respectively, though estimates differ significantly. Furthermore, a large proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain and other European countries originate from Afghanistan. We should bear in mind that many have extremist backgrounds and that we are therefore vulnerable to the implantation and cultivation of Islamic extremists within our own societies, not just from Afghanistan. This is madness. More focused and determined action is needed to deal with these problems and encourage return to Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">On the funding question, the USD 4.5 billion pledged at Tokyo in January, including over USD 1 billion from the European Union, has, for the most part, been slow to arrive – although I note the Commissioner's remarks about the way the Commission has responded. There is an absorption problem: the Afghan Interim Government lacks the institutions to disburse the money efficiently and needs greater assistance in this area. At the same time there has to be proper control and management of international funds. I say this at a time when, yet again, the European Commission's procedures in this respect have been the subject of serious criticism and, as in the Palestine Authority area until recently, the issue of proper control of funds appears to have been largely avoided by the international community. The Bonn Agreement merely states: 'The members of the Interim Administration shall abide by a Code of Conduct elaborated in accordance with international standards.' This Code is not published and, in any case, seems less than adequate. We must insist that measures be put in place by the Afghan authorities and the international community, including the European Union, to ensure the proper management, accounting and use of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the question of landmines, which has already been touched on by other speakers. Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. This was the case before last September and the situation has been exacerbated since then. The presence of landmines and UXOs – unexploded ordnance – are a major obstacle to economic and social regeneration. It is estimated that between five and ten people are injured in mine blasts every day in Afghanistan and that an estimated 10 million mines litter the country. We welcome the undertaking by the Afghan Interim Government to accede to the Geneva Convention banning the use of antipersonnel landmines, but the mines are still there in the ground and the victims hobble through the streets. There is an urgent requirement for a properly coordinated and funded programme of action to enable the resumption of mine action operations at least at the level they had reached before last September. A concerted time-limited effort is needed, otherwise we are still going to be talking about this in ten years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much to be done in Afghanistan. Let us get it right, working in harmony with the United States and other allies – and all the time remember why we are there.</p>

I would, however, just like to focus on three points. Firstly, we must restore the role, responsibility and visibility of the United Nations. In terms of assessing the outcome of the intervention, in terms of analyses which would justify any further action, we note that the United Nations is absent, often considered to be an intruder, and is, in effect, excluded. This unilateralist approach does not further the cause of Afghanistan, not least in that we are legitimately and frankly concerned at the way we are blindly placing all our trust in President Bush, whose approach to foreign policy is quite inconsistent and has, moreover, even been questioned by his Executive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we reject double standards in matters of human rights. We call for guarantees of fair trials for all accused persons, whatever the offence they are being charged with. We call for respect for international conventions. It may be that some of them need to be reworked and revised, and they must genuinely be revised, not set aside. We call for these guarantees to be applied to all accused persons because it is a fundamental rule, a fundamental principle that there is no room for compromise in human rights, particularly if it is designed to make things easier for ourselves. I would stress: whoever the accused person is.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, through this resolution, we call upon the Afghan authorities to make the greatest possible endeavours to obtain justice for the journalists killed in Afghanistan and to expose the truth behind their murders – I reiterate, to obtain justice and to reveal the truth: as well as justice, we demand to be informed of the reasons why many journalists have been killed. If we have had the opportunity to find out about what has happened in Afghanistan, it is partly thanks to the journalists who decided to go and report on this war on the spot. To call for justice for those who fell doing their duty, Mr President, and for the truth behind their deaths to be revealed, is the least that Parliament can do now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all the more opposed because the aim is to brainwash nations into believing that the imperialists have the right, on various and sundry pretexts, to intervene, bomb, kill, destroy entire countries and set up puppet regimes. It happened in Iraq in 1991, in Cyprus in 1974, in Yugoslavia in 1993-99 and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the horrendous attack on 11 September, the pretext for the savage attack on Afghanistan, which resulted in unimaginable destruction, countless thousands of victims and mass slaughter, was the fight against terrorism, based on the arbitrary, unproven claim that the US agent bin Laden, al-Qa’ida and the USA-supported Taliban, were to blame. As US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has stated, no confirmation is needed for this sort of military operation. Unfortunately, this view is shared by many here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair, who is even more merciless, tells us that the attack on Afghanistan was carried out as the moral basis for the forthcoming attack on Iraq. Today, the US president has shown his cynicism by stating that, even if Iraq allows inspectors, the problem will only be resolved by war, never mind that this will result in yet more slaughter and give even more support to Saddam. The excuse for such an attack, even with the blessing of the United Nations, is the unproven claim that the brutal dictatorship headed by Saddam holds weapons of mass destruction. And yet those who make these claims have many more far more destructive weapons scattered throughout the world and are threatening to turn them against China, Russia and elsewhere. Hence, the Bush regime is even more dangerous and nations need to unite against it...</p>

Nevertheless, Afghanistan has come a long way since the rout of Mullah Omar and the disappearance, hopefully for good, of Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p class="contents">Girls are back at school, music and film are allowed again and football is replacing public hangings. We have had a successful Bonn Conference and a Tokyo Donors Conference. The Loya Jirga was opened by the former king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting last September in Rome. He has now been granted the title of 'Father of the Nation', as he has worked tirelessly and assiduously behind the scenes to reunite his nation and stop squabbling, particularly amongst the Pashtun communities.</p>
<p class="contents">However ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force, still has its work cut out. We have witnessed the assassination of two ministers and this week a bomb attack, presumably aimed against western forces. We still see the evils of warlordism, ethnic division and a flourishing drug trade. I was shocked to read that the opium crop this year was up to three thousand tonnes, overtaking even that of the Golden Triangle's 900 tonnes in Myanmar and Thailand. We still have the problem of considerable sympathy for Islamic terrorism in neighbouring Iran, where some al-Qa'ida fighters have allegedly taken refuge, but almost certainly many are sheltering in Pakistan, where president Musharraf walks a tightrope between cooperating with the West and yet not fully cracking down on his home-grown Jihadi Islamic terrorist groups despite pledging to do so. These groups infiltrate Indian Kashmir, causing mayhem and making a war between the two nuclear neighbours a very real possibility. Clearly, President Musharraf does not want a peaceful Kashmir election to be held.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan is also not fully cooperating with ISAF, allowing it to enter the tribal areas of the north-west frontier region where al-Qa'ida is currently regrouping to threaten Afghanistan's government and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The West must now be prepared to extend the mandate of Turkish-led ISAF forces beyond this December at the UN and extend their remit to Afghan provinces as well, to end the warlordism and extend the government's authority in the provinces as part of the nation-building exercise and construct a national army and police force and distribute much needed aid to a desperately poor country.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the USD 1.8 billion promised in Tokyo for reconstruction has yet to materialise. Only humanitarian aid has been seen so far. The recent Operation Mountain Sweep has only brought a few weapon caches to light and we still have a long way to go to make this beautiful country a peaceful and prosperous one and a respectable member of the international community again as it was once in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel particularly strongly that the government of Afghanistan should grant a moratorium on the use of Sharia law in areas such as the stoning to death of women and the amputation of limbs, in order to show how a modern Islamic country respects international covenants and treaty obligations and promotes justice without cruelty or abuse of human rights. War criminals must also be brought to book and tried. Refugees coming to the West who are terrorist sympathisers or have been active with the Taliban or al-Qa'ida must be sent back to face the music.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely wish President Karzai and ex-king Mohammad Zahir Shah well with all the challenging problems that they face in the months to come. Overall, I sincerely hope that Afghanistan will again be a respectable member of the international community as it once was.</p>

The current situation now shows that a great deal of sustained effort and programmes specifically designed for women will be needed in order to re-establish the minimum right to personal autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, many practical actions that the European Union can establish. We propose, for example, a project offering women the chance to exchange their burkas for driving licences, so that women can exercise their right to free movement and, if they so wish, exchange this item of clothing – which incapacitates them – for cars and driving licences. The Commission should set in motion a cooperation project allowing Afghan women to make this change: burkas for driving licences, with cars included.</p>

It has left a State with levels of poverty and illiteracy, including returning illiteracy, in men as well as women, which are truly incredible. Furthermore, the lack of integration between the different cultural, social, religious and ethnic identities making up Afghan society increases the complexity of the problem with which the transitional government has to deal on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, governing this country means not just carrying out essential institutional reforms, starting with the Constitution, but creating a basic banking system from scratch with all speed, disseminating education and promoting respect between the citizens and ethnic groups, rebuilding cities and infrastructure, separating military and civil affairs and creating anew industry and agriculture which will be able to survive in a globalised world. The challenge facing the transitional government is not inconsiderable, for it is a question of doing everything at once with all possible speed, as cheaply as possible and with the widest possible participation. Clearly, these tasks are not easy, particularly if they have to be carried out within a relatively short space of time. Moreover, Mr Karzai has explicitly undertaken to achieve a stable peace between the citizens, between ethnic groups and between the sexes, to establish the bases for democratisation of the country in the transitional government’s two years of office.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Commissioner Patten said, the path is still very tortuous. There has been no real, practical improvement in the situation of women, in particular, despite Mr Karzai’s statements. The level of illiteracy among women is incredible – six or seven percent compared to 39% previously. Even the new government has deteriorated from this point of view, with some warlords assuming a political role not just in the decentralised administrations but in the Kabul government too. Censorship has increased, as has been mentioned, and women continue to wear the <span class="italic">burka</span> and are marginalised, particularly in the southern and south-eastern regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must multiply its endeavours to ensure that the hopes which were raised at Bonn are not completely dashed and that the present situation of far-reaching inequality, discrimination and failure to respect human rights does not become established in the long-term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like firstly to add a couple of remarks about the issue of possible infringements of human rights, for example in connection with the recent discovery of mass graves in northern Afghanistan. There must be no doubt that the Council attaches crucial importance to the Afghan Government’s and the Afghan people’s taking responsibility for the past and for the war crimes that might have been committed. That does not of course mean only the atrocities committed by the Taliban regime. In that connection, President Karzai’s statement that the issue of the mass graves is to be investigated is encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN will play a central role in assisting the Afghan Government with this work. The EU too will of course help as far as possible, partly through our special representative, Mr Vendrell.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the difficult security situation, especially in the areas outside Kabul, it is my view that the most realistic and forward-looking approach at the moment is to strengthen the transitional government’s ability to take care of security itself, partly through assisting with demobilisation, building up the army and the police, developing programmes designed to root out drugs production and setting up an efficient judiciary. A number of EU Member States are making valuable contributions to this work. That also applies to the important task, to which Mr Van Orden referred, of clearing the many mines which are a constant danger to the civilian population and make economic regeneration more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also alert to the large need for aid of various kinds which has been highlighted on many sides of this Chamber and which is perhaps greater than first assumed, partly because of the large number of refugees who have returned. In order to contribute to stability in the country, we must, as has been stated, secure a visible peace dividend for the Afghan population. Aid is also an important tool in our efforts to strengthen the transitional government at the expense of the local warlords. I might point out that, at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in July, the Chairman of the Council reminded the Member States of the need to ensure that the promises made at the Tokyo Donor Conference earlier in the year are complied with in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of the situation of women in Afghanistan was raised on quite a few sides of the Chamber. Right from the beginning, the strengthening of women’s rights has been an absolutely central feature of EU policy, and we shall pursue this objective both in our dialogue with the Afghan parties and through the aid we provide. As Mrs Izquierdo Rojo said, it is a question of replacing burkas with driving licences. I agree entirely. Commissioner Patten will no doubt also say a little about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In an overall assessment of the situation in Afghanistan and of the efforts by the international community, it is important to keep a sense of proportion. As many have pointed out, there are serious problems in Afghanistan today. There are problems with security, with drugs production and, especially, with women’s rights. Compared with the situation less than a year ago, the conditions under which ordinary Afghans live have improved no end. It may be said that still more might have been expected, but I do not in actual fact think it could have been. In view of the circumstances, there was reason to fear the worst. The EU and the Member States reacted quickly and generously, as soon as the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of Europeans, soldiers, police, emergency aid workers and officials are now making invaluable efforts to help Afghanistan get back on its feet. It is a difficult, thankless and dangerous task. Many had to lose their lives. We must, of course, always be receptive to criticism, but the efforts of all the courageous and committed people who have helped rebuild Afghanistan must not be belittled. On the contrary, we owe it to them to point out the major results that have been achieved. Europe has nothing to be ashamed of in Afghanistan, and I would just add, last of all, that 100 000 Afghans are now returning home to Afghanistan. Only very few are obtaining asylum in our countries, because it is now safe in Afghanistan, in any case in large areas of the country. In this connection, it is a question of acting in accordance with the declaration from the Seville Summit and making vigorous efforts to facilitate repatriation. That is something we owe to Afghanistan and to those people who are now taking the courageous step of returning.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, let me make one or two comments in reply to this debate. First of all, I am grateful for the kind words expressed about the work that has been done by our Commission staff in Kabul and Afghanistan as a whole. Those tributes are wholly justified. The remarks made about the International Security Assistance Force underline the importance of the role that has been undertaken by the military in extending security. I am sure that Member States will note what a number of Members of this House have said about the possibility of extending the role of ISAF and extending its mandate. It is certainly the case that, if we want to see the authority of the Transitional Authority run right across the whole of the country, then it is imperative that we do not undermine that authority by reinventing the warlords as part of the continuing campaign against al-Qa'ida and the Taliban. It is absolutely imperative that we give all our support to President Karzai and his team.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make three other points. First of all, Mrs Maes reminded us of the great importance of not making the same mistakes that we made after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. We are not engaged in what has occasionally been rather derisorily described as nation-building or, by one distinguished politician, as social work. All I can say is that it is a pity there was not more social work and nation-building in the 1980s after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. We might have avoided some of the excesses of the Taliban if that had been the case and avoided the problems that have been visited upon us. What the honourable Member said is a reminder that the task that we have put our shoulder to is not going to be a short one. We have to be in Afghanistan, we have to be working in partnership with Afghanistan for many years to come. It is going to take a long time to complete this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Several honourable Members – principally ladies, although it should be an issue of just as much importance to people of my sex as well – referred to gender issues. We must ensure that they get proper priority in our development assistance and development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Izquierdo Rojo asked about exchanging burkas for car licences. She has not, alas, been able to stay with us for the end of the debate, but I will examine the point that she made and we will certainly ensure that the delegation to which she referred gets as much help as is required. It is extremely important for Members of this House to visit Afghanistan, see for themselves what is going on and give their support to the early stages of the democratic process in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now deal with the issue of implementing the pledges and promises that were made in Tokyo. It is obviously important, as we discovered in Kosovo, in East Timor and in other countries and societies recovering from crisis, to ensure that the help which is pledged arrives as swiftly as possible. Not all is perfect by any means in Afghanistan. When Mr Tannock said that only humanitarian aid had arrived so far, that was a tad exaggerated. Certainly, as I made clear in my own speech, a great deal of reconstruction assistance has already been provided by the European Commission and others. It is particularly notable that the money we have been providing for budgetary support just to get government running – and we have probably been the biggest providers of that support – has certainly been provided rapidly and has been well used.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer to the point made by Mr Van Orden about ensuring that even as one spends money rapidly, it is spent prudently and transparently because we have to be aware of the Court of Auditors, we have to be aware of the terrors of appearing in front of the Committee on Budgetary Control or the Committee on Budgets, we have to be aware of the importance of keeping European public opinion on our side. Just as in the case of the Palestinian Authority, to which he referred, it is the European Commission which has actually led the way in ensuring that reformed and transparent financial controls are put in place. We have led the way in reforming those financial controls which everybody is now supporting and using. Equally in Afghanistan, it was the European Commission which made itself tiresome by arguing initially for dollarisation of the budget, just as we did in Kosovo. We were in fact the only people arguing for dollarisation of the budget. We have settled reasonably happily for other arrangements, in close consultation with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I do get fed up with the suggestion again and again that we are more lax in the way we support other countries and other governments in crisis than anybody else. On the whole, what we are now managing to do is to provide assistance more rapidly and in ways which will actually stand up to the closest scrutiny by this Parliament and by the Court of Auditors. Sometimes we should actually recognise what we are achieving and not just assume that what tabloid newspapers say about us is correct.</p>
