It offers an interpretation of the measures aimed at ensuring optimum results from work in the Councils. It does not refer only to the European Council but also to councils deriving from it. In addition, it sets out to improve the efficiency of the European Council and other councils, notably the General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of the suggestions contained in this communication would not require amendment of the Treaties. The suggestions largely coincide with the proposals put forward by the High Representative, the Secretary-General of the Council at the Barcelona European Council. These are intended as a contribution to the current debate on improving the working of the Council with a view to preparing it for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member is doubtless aware that the Seville European Council is to rule on a series of proposals presented by the Secretary-General, the High Representative of the Council, at the Barcelona European Council. These proposals are aimed specifically at improving and making more efficient the work of the European Council and sectoral Councils. The Schröeder-Blair document is therefore just one more contribution to this debate, along with that of Prime Minister Persson of Sweden. The debate is open, and should culminate at the Seville European Council. The changes it is hoped to introduce will not of course affect the Treaties. That is solely within the competence of the Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say, however, that you are talking of the right of veto and I am talking of unanimous decision-making. I want to remind you that in the most democratic societies decisions can be made either by simple majority or by qualified majority or by unanimity, and the fact that we have unanimity when making decisions in the Council does not imply the use of a right of veto; it merely means we have to try harder for everyone to agree. Moreover, you will agree with me that there are still areas subject to Community decision-making which, because they are politically sensitive, require the Council to try hard – as hard as is needed – to unify what we all want. That is the positive explanation I give for the fact that unanimity still exists in just a very few aspects of decision-making in the Union. It will continue to exist, provided that it is politically necessary, in order to maintain balances, which I believe are a major fact of life in all the countries that make up the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore do not mind answering that in its Declaration on 16 March the European Council clearly stated that the bloodshed must stop, that there can be no military solution to the Middle East conflict, and that peace and security can only be achieved through negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is keeping in constant touch with the two sides and other important players, particularly through the High Representative for the CFSP, who has already visited the region three times this year. I recall that the President-in-Office of the Council has been twice. The European Union special representative for the Middle East peace process, Mr Moratinos, is continuing his efforts in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been working closely with other interested parties, such as the United States, Russia and the United Nations; proof of this is the summit taking place today in Madrid between the four players I have mentioned – the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the Presidency of the European Union. It has also been in contact with countries in the region. In addition, it has expressed its support for the recent initiative by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. The Council is delighted that this initiative has been backed by the Arab League Summit in Beirut, which the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union also attended; this was indeed an unprecedented action because never before has a President-in-Office of the Council been invited to take part in a meeting of Arab League Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that all the preconditions for peace have been placed on the table by the European Union, as was made quite clear here in the debate we had yesterday. Contacts are continuing, and we hope that decisions may come out of today’s meeting that will allow us to achieve an immediate ceasefire and start peace talks straight away to re-establish order between Palestine and Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know it is difficult to come back to this question again and again. However, you will see that my question was submitted at the end of February. Like my colleague, Mr De Rossa, I did not have time to speak in the House yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">There comes a time within a negotiation when the kid gloves must come off, when action must be taken. The European Union delegation was given a kick in the face by the Israelis by not being allowed to meet with the necessary parties to try to start a dialogue and bring it around. We have to be more vocal in our support for the right of the Palestinian people to have their own state, whilst at the same time guaranteeing the right of Israel to its security. None of us could agree with or condone the suicide bombings which have taken place over the last number of weeks. But likewise it would be wrong of us not to strongly condemn the reactions taken by the Israeli forces. Until such time as both sides can be brought together to work out a solution then peace will never arrive. Peace can only be built on parity of esteem, where there is respect for the territorial integrity and the rights of each group.</p>

But I should also like to remind her that the subject of education is not something that lies within the competence of the Community, but is the exclusive competence of the Member States. I am very pleased to hear – although I do not know the details, I do know enough to say this – that environmental subjects are already included in primary and secondary teaching and, of course, at university level in most Member States. As I say, however, this is something that falls to the Member States and is not within the competence of the Community. The only institution that has the right of initiative to submit proposals is the Commission and, since it has no legal base to make proposals on this, it has not made any. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason I asked this question, however, is precisely because it is really urgent. You all know that people everywhere are talking of nothing but sustainable development, without knowing exactly what this term means.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore take action, and I think it would be useful if, at Council and European Union level, an initiative was taken precisely so that we could envisage every pupil, every high school student perhaps, being able to have a lesson on ‘sustainable development and the environment’ within the European Union. Although it is not the responsibility of the Member States, I believe there have been other requests on the history of the European Union. I think this is urgent, as we have been talking about the environment and environmental education for thirty years, and ultimately, this subject is always the responsibility of the Member States or the voluntary sector. I think it is time, and the matter is urgent now, to implement provisions and practical initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You know that the possibility was raised in Intergovernmental Conferences of amending the articles of the Treaty, and this was rejected by several countries that I am not going to name, but you know which they are.</p>

In chronological order they are Denmark, United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council wishes, however, to correct the statement that only two Member States have begun ratification procedures. That is not the case: these procedures have been started in all the Member States without exception, and they are even nearing completion in Spain, for instance. I could almost say it is a matter of days rather than weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The ratification procedures are following their normal course, although it is a long process, and we can expect that, if nothing untoward happens, all the Member States will have ratified the Cotonou Agreement before the end of this year, 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency of the Council – which has been aware of this situation – has contacted all the Member States of the Union to urge them to push forward and speed up their ratification procedures, and nothing would give us greater satisfaction than to be able to say that by the end of our Presidency the Cotonou Agreement had been ratified. We must bear in mind that this agreement will come into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the ratification instruments are deposited by the European Union Member States and two thirds – i.e. 51 – of the ACP states, as well as the instrument by which the Community approves the agreement. As of today, 42 ACP states have deposited their ratification instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take this opportunity to emphasise once again that the Presidency is reminding all the contracting parties to the Cotonou Agreement that full implementation of this agreement is urgent, since it is an essential component of the European Union’s foreign cooperation and development policy. I did so myself on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly which took place in Cape Town from 18 to 21 March this year. This will of course be a priority issue at the meeting of ACP-EU Ministers to be held at Punta Cana –Dominican Republic – on 28 June, during the Spanish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also think the time is just right. The Monterey Conference on development funding has taken place, and in Johannesburg there is going to be a world conference on sustainable development in early September, at which development funding and all the actions developed under the Cotonou Agreement will be high on the agenda. I am, of course, prepared to bring this up with the Commission – with the Commissioner responsible – and to back a campaign to effectively raise European citizens’ awareness of the importance of this instrument, which places Europe at the head of development cooperation in the world we live in. This is particularly important, especially when you take into account the fact that at Monterey we were reminded of the special duty that the more developed countries have to help the less developed ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, adjustments in the modern society that has emerged on the international scene in the twentieth century have caused flashpoints to develop in various parts of the various continents; it has not been possible to defuse these flashpoints, because they are highly charged both politically and emotionally.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir evidently does not claim our full attention, but not because it is not a serious problem but precisely because of the praiseworthy efforts made by both India and Pakistan to contain this hotbed, which has been on the brink of sparking off a war that could have had incalculable consequences. This was possible thanks to the spirit of dialogue which still exists between India and Pakistan, despite their many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council has been extraordinarily appreciative of this spirit of conciliation shown by the Indian Government and the Pakistani Government, particularly over the recent months when very serious events have occurred, with terrorist attacks that could have destabilised the region, which was already unsettled enough with the conflict in Afghanistan. The Presidency has, of course, been offering both sides its services since the very first day.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Pakistan and India are countries with a high culture and long traditions. They believe they can solve the conflict by themselves. If they should need us, you can rest assured that we will be there for them, but for the time being the spirit of dialogue that reigns between the two powers, Pakistan and India, suggests that slowly but surely they have the will to solve this conflict, which is similar to what happened at the time of separation from India, when Pakistan became independent, which sparked off great frustrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I have to say is that Taiwan poses a political problem that you are aware of – and which, naturally, I am not going to go into – and so the Common Consular Instructions on Visas do not state that visas should be automatically issued to people from Taiwan, especially to someone as significant as the President of the Government. Nevertheless, any European Union country that itself wants to issue such a visa exclusively for entry into that country may do so, and nobody will stop it. That, of course, depends on the political considerations of each Member State, and I imagine it does not escape you that there are powerful political grounds and great pressure from China for such visas not to be issued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Action to unblock international adoptions in Romania</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following pressure from various international institutions, the Romanian government decided in June 2001 to suspend international adoptions. It is now preparing a new adoption law which will reportedly soon be put before the national parliament. Nonetheless, on 7 December 2001 the Romanian government adopted an 'emergency ordinance' opening the door to the completion of the procedures currently sub judice, thus authorising certain exceptions to the blockage of procedures pending adoption of the new law.</p>
<p class="contents">A considerable number of families from the Member States, including 1200 from Spain, had started the procedure for adopting a Romanian child. In some cases, the Romanian Adoption Committee had gone so far as to assign a child to prospective parents, and the couple concerned had visited Romania to get to know the child – only to be faced with the suspension measure. These circumstances apply to 17 requests made by Spanish families to whom a child has been assigned by the Romanian government and who have been waiting for confirmation from the Romanian Adoption Committee before they can act within the Romanian legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Council taken, or what action does it intend to take, vis-à-vis the Romanian authorities to ensure that these 17 procedures are completed? What initiatives does the Council intend to promote to ensure that the families whose adoption procedure has been bureaucratically blocked since 2000 are offered a rapid solution to an agonising situation which now has been going on for far too long?</p>

<p class="contents">In June 2001 the Romanian Adoption Committee stopped referring children to international adoption foundations and suspended the registration of new foreign families requesting international adoption for at least one year. Will the Council state what steps it is taking to seek the lifting of the moratorium on international adoptions in Romania, and is it satisfied that enough is being done to integrate childcare policy with other sectoral policies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this very time and in this sitting I answered a question by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and I spoke plainly and at length on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The question now asked is identical. I could refer you to my reply to Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, but I am not going to do so; instead I am going to read out exactly what I replied to him, so that everyone will know that the Council has not in fact changed its mind between March and April:</p>
<p class="contents">“The European Union has systematically given priority to the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities within its relations with the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">“This issue is a key element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries, in accordance with the political requirements for accession established by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993.</p>
<p class="contents">“In the case of Romania, one of the specific areas included in the pre-accession strategy is childcare. In the Commission’s periodic report for 2000 on Romania’s progress towards accession, the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the legislation and practice on adoption between different countries, which allow considerations other than the best interests of the child to influence decisions on adoption. As a result of this, and other expressions of concern, the Romanian Government decided to suspend international adoptions. In the revised Association for the accession of Romania, adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, amongst the intermediate priorities and objectives, it is stipulated that Romania must maintain the moratorium on international adoption until new legislation is adopted which is compatible with the interests of the children and with Romania’s international obligations, and the necessary administrative capacity to apply the new legislation is guaranteed. As well as maintaining the general moratorium, the Romanian Government adopted measures in December 2001 to allow for the completion of adoption procedures in those cases which were already before the courts at the time of the suspension of international adoptions. The Presidency of the Council believes that the adoptions of those children whose adoption procedures have already begun in the Member States, with all legal guarantees, should be completed within a reasonable period.”</p>
<p class="contents">Actually, the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union – the President of the Spanish Government, Mr Aznar – obtained this commitment when he visited Mr Iliescu and Mr Nastase last November during a tour of capital cities prior to the beginning of the Presidency. There we were given guarantees that the adoptions were to go ahead and, moreover, that they were going to introduce all the legislation needed. Thus the Presidency did this before it started its term of office, and now it intends – as was said in the reply – to ‘closely monitor the situation in Romania in this regard, especially within the bodies created within the framework of the European Agreement, such as the Association Council and the Association Committee.’</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that this subject was raised at the last meeting of the Association Council, and we have also raised it bilaterally with both the Prime Minister, Mr Nastase, and the Foreign Minister, Mr Geoana. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr de Miguel, I do not want the Council to change its mind, and I also believe that we need to protect children, but, do you not think that our governments could at least be as effective as their American counterparts? You are well aware that in February, after a visit from the Romanian President to the United States, and pursuant to this new decree and this new legislation, nineteen children were given up to American families for adoption. Do you not think that, once this decree is in force and we have removed barriers to adoption, keeping a close eye, of course, on the children involved, but also asking the Romanian Government to ensure equal treatment for European families, the solution lies in properly exerted political pressure? Do you not think that if Mr Aznar were to include this issue in his agenda once again, if he were to pick up the telephone, if he were to establish political contact at a high level, this issue – which affects at least 17 Spanish families that have already been allocated children – the barriers would be removed, as has been the case for the Americans? I think it would, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I would ask him to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has been raised again, most recently at the Barcelona European Council. I am not aware of the measures Romania has taken with regard to children given up for adoption to American families, nor do I know the specific details of the adoptions under way in EU Member States. I would remind you that the Presidency makes no exceptions for nationality – all children in the EU are equal, whether they be Spanish or from any other Member State. I do not know the numbers of adoptions under way that have been unblocked, but I have the impression that the process is well underway. In any case, I would like to tell you, Mrs Díez, that we will naturally spare no effort, and if we need to take further action, we will not hesitate to do so.

<p class="contents">My supplementary question relates in particular to vast evidence that is available to us in Parliament thanks to a report that Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne drew up on behalf of Parliament. It is in the interests of a lot of children to be given up for adoption because they can have a better chance in life. In particular there are a number of severely disabled children in orphanages in Romania for whom there are willing host families in European Union countries. These families are now being prevented from taking what in a lot of cases would be unwanted children in Romania and other countries – in America in particular. There are host families in the European Union who are willing to take in severely traumatised and disabled children – disabled both physically and mentally – into their own families. Unfortunately they have been blocked from doing so.</p>

I can only agree with you when you say that these children would be much better off living with a family than in a charitable institution, which usually have neither the resources nor the money available to be able to offer these children a decent life.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue of adoption, however, is very emotional for Romania and states in a similar situation to it, and, because it is emotional, it is also highly political. The Romanian Government is not finding it easy to put its house in order where this matter is concerned, because this issue has also been tainted by the unbelievable corruption that has tarnished Romanian public life.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should give a vote of confidence to the new government put together by Mr Nastase, an honest Prime Minister, which is trying to establish a system free from corruption and based to the greatest possible extent on respect for rights and human rights as it is required to do by the Copenhagen accession criteria for EU candidate countries, and I feel that we need to give Romanian Government the space it needs to be able to reconstruct the adoption system. This issue, however, which affects many families, is a humanitarian issue. There is also the problem of families who are still waiting for the children they have already been allocated; we need to take care of this situation and then give the Romanian Government the room for manoeuvre it needs to establish a completely transparent adoption system that allows Romanian children, that have neither family nor fortune, to find a better future with European or American families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I rise because, although the Council position has not altered, the Romanian Government has put in a great deal of work, and I want to commend to the Council the report that came out just a few days ago from the independent group for international adoption analysis, which the Prime Minister commissioned. The report has now been adopted and will be published and promoted once one or two details have been sorted out.</p>
<p class="contents">This new report is very important, in particular for unblocking pipeline cases, which I know will give my good and eminent colleague, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, very great pleasure. But we need to remember that it is not just families in Spain and North America who are affected by the corruption and child-trafficking to which the Council has referred. There are many thousands of children in Romania who have families of their own and have become detached from them. So the whole system has to be refreshed, renewed and looked at, as the Council has said. It is a very important matter, particularly in regard to severely disabled children, and I feel confident the new report helps on priority as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Council, however, is that I am very concerned at reports, that appear to be very well-founded that the US, stirred perhaps by the emotion that this issue creates, is linking the potential membership of Romania to NATO, which this Parliament 100% supports, with the lifting of the moratorium on inter-country adoption.

If there are now at least 50 000 children in orphanages, we will not be able to resolve this problem using this system. Is the Romanian Government truly exempt, because of its duty to eradicate corruption, from a basic principle of the European Union, which is the non-retroactivity of current laws, under which adoptions have hitherto been processed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying, however, that there are tens of thousands. I also agree that one way – a humane way – of providing some kind of future for these unfortunate children would be to speed up the adoption procedure. However, I also said that I believe this is a serious political problem for the new Romanian Government, which is dogged by what has happened in the past. This government is taking great steps to produce legislation on and to put some kind of order into this issue of adoption which, I might add, is extraordinarily sensitive inasmuch as it affects the whole of Romanian society. Therefore, I think that we must be prepared to give this government the benefit of the doubt and have faith that Mr Nastase and his government will implement this new legislation and be able to re-establish the pace of adoptions that existed before.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of retroactivity is one option for the Romanian Government, which can, if it wants, apply the old legislation, or wait to apply the new legislation. In any event, we have already reached the compromise that children allocated under the old legislation will be delivered to the corresponding families, and this is what is actually happening at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The intention was to match this information with descriptions provided under Article 99 of the Schengen Agreement, but with a different aim: that is to say, to actually prevent these people participating in certain events, instead of implementing specific or one-off surveillance operations, as has been the case recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Ministers debated this proposal at the meeting of the Joint Committee on 7 December 2001. There were differences of opinion and some delegations firmly opposed to the proposal. Consequently, no detailed examination of the proposal by experts was carried out nor were the possible conditions for the introduction of this information on particular individuals made clear in case it was agreed that these measures would be introduced. Therefore, at this time, a definitive answer to the question cannot be given but, taking account of current opinions, it does not seem likely that this proposal will prosper in the near future and even less likely that it could affect persons who have not committed any crime.</p>
<p class="contents">For your information, the Council would like to point out that there is a draft Council Decision concerning security at international football matches. In the aforementioned draft decision, the exchange of police information between national football information points is anticipated but not the use of the SIS for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has not been receptive to this idea of adding to the SIS lists of persons known solely for their slightly unusual activities at particular events, because this would give rise to an absolutely intolerable surveillance of persons who have committed no crime. The SIS is only used to compile lists of criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where public order issues are expected to arise, such as at sporting or political events, or demonstrations, as has been the case in the past, the discreet surveillance of individuals entering a country and of borders is far more effective than compiling such lists which are not only odious, but run counter to our civic tradition as a whole. I would like to remind you that the last occasion when discreet surveillance was used was the Barcelona Council, to prevent the streets of Barcelona from being turned into some sort of battleground, as happened in Genoa. The temporary suspension of the Schengen Agreement allowed the Spanish police to stop several troublemakers at the border, who were carrying clubs and baseball bats with which to break shop windows, for example. More than 2 000 implements were confiscated. Everyone was allowed to cross the border, except those carrying objects with the aim of causing destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Such controls are surely more effective than the publication of a list of persons that have theoretically committed no crime and who, therefore, have absolutely no reason to be classified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Spanish Presidency can pride itself on the fact that absolutely no violent acts were committed in Barcelona, against goods, property, persons or against demonstrators, because the police as expected – carried out their task of control and surveillance with sufficient respect for the people demonstrating, always attempting to separate troublemakers from peaceful demonstrators. It should be remembered that the Barcelona demonstration was an extraordinary display of civic unity and that for a demonstration of such size to be free from violence is quite unprecedented. Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the best way of preventing these occurrences from taking place is to carry out effective surveillance and to have a police force that knows how to operate effectively, as was the case at the Barcelona European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
