The loss of two soldiers and two civilians belonging to the African Union peace-keeping mission in Darfur has been a shock for all of us. The European Commission vigorously condemns this cruel and cowardly act. I should like to express my most sincere condolences to the African Union and to all the soldiers of the mission, and I should like to say to them that Europe supports them more than ever in the quest for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, with the adoption, today, of a European strategy on Africa, the European Commission is taking, I think, a giant step towards a new political partnership between Europe and Africa – a strategic, solid and rational partnership between, on the one hand, an enlarged Europe and, on the other hand, a renewed Africa. For too long, relations between Europe and Africa have been characterised by a lack of consistency between the definition and implementation of policies; between, on the one hand, the policies and actions of certain Member States and, on the other, those of the European Commission; between the approach adopted in sub-Saharan Africa and that adopted in North Africa; between cooperation in connection with trade and that in connection with economic development; and between initiatives in connection with traditional socio-economic development and measures in connection with strategic policy. Neither Europe nor Africa could tolerate this situation going on any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the new strategy on Africa that I am presenting to you today is, therefore, to provide the EU with a single, global and integrated framework for managing its relations with Africa in the long term. For the first time, Europe is coherently addressing Africa as a whole from Cairo to the Cape. Even if Africa has several faces, several histories and different needs, it has now embarked as a single entity on the road to the political, economic and cultural integration of the whole continent. This commitment has been given concrete expression by the efforts to integrate the regional economic communities and by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, or NEPAD, and the launch of the African Union. These organisations now embody the hope of the continent. I also remember the scepticism surrounding the creation of the African Union three years ago. Now, remarkable progress in all areas, particularly those of peace and security, can be observed. The African Union is a major strategic player and, I would even venture to say, a player that, as far as we are concerned, cannot be ignored on the African continent. Europe has a duty to respond to the call from an Africa in which a lot is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time too, this strategy creates a framework of action for Europe as a whole. It is not a question of eliminating the various national policies. I shall go on repeating that these national policies have their own specific character and added value. No, it is, rather, a question of creating a coherent framework for reinforcing collective action at European level. Together, we are more effective and count for more. Enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States has reinforced this need because it has increased the number of potential individual partners to 26: 25 Member States plus the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough for EU aid to increase. Its effectiveness needs also to be improved. In the past, the absence of coordination and complementarity between donors has often prevented development policies leading to practical and effective results. The European Union has already done a lot to improve this situation, particularly within the framework of the High Level Forum on the effectiveness of aid, held in Paris in March 2005. I think, however, that we must go further. That is why I propose establishing next year an action plan for aid effectiveness which we would apply, as a priority, in sub-Saharan Africa. This action plan will contain practical tools once, for example, an operational and interactive atlas of EU donors has been created, national ‘road maps’ harmonised, joint programming documents adopted and common procedures drawn up. Some might consider this initiative to be a departure from the norm. In fact, it is only a matter of applying what we have all already decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the European Union should broaden its budgetary support both generally and on a sectoral basis. That would not only make EU aid more transparent and predictable and give it more continuity, but would also give the EU much more collective influence through the action it takes. For the first time, the European Union finally possesses a global and integrated framework for its different policies for administering its relations with Africa. As I have already said on several occasions in this very Chamber, priority will be given to sub-Saharan Africa in applying all the decisions we have taken in terms of increasing the quantity, quality, effectiveness and coherence of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us return to the subject of coherence. Until now, policies on Africa governing trade, security, the environment and what is referred to as development coexisted as best they could. It has to be said that these policies were not always articulated and were even contradictory sometimes. For example, European security policy has for a long time coexisted with its development policy, sometimes to no good effect. Recent experience – and I am thinking in particular of opportunities for peace in Africa – show how security and development are intimately linked and how important it is for European policies in these areas to be tightly coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the central objective of the European Union strategy for Africa is to make it easier to achieve the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals in Africa. In my opinion, these need to be our points of departure and of reference. That is why the Commission proposes a triple strategy: firstly, to reinforce policies in those areas – for example, peace and security and good governance - considered to be those in which preliminary conditions have to be met in order for the development goals to be achieved; secondly, to reinforce the policies – for example, on trade, development of the private sector and the connection between the two - that create the economic environment necessary for achieving these goals; and, finally, to strengthen policies in the areas directly linked to the development goals, such as health, education, employment and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, these measures constitute a joint, global and coherent response by the European Union to the challenge of African development. These measures are ambitious and are obviously very wide-ranging indeed but, in order fundamentally to change the course of history, we need to do more: we need to clarify our basic approach, the spirit of our relations and, perhaps also sometimes, our mentality. That is why the communication proposes adapting the principles governing relations between Europe and Africa to a new African and European reality. In order to do this, three key principles have to be applied: equality, appropriation and dialogue. We shall have to replace culpability and charity as determining factors in our partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">First principle: equality. The emergence of the African Union and the regional economic communities, on the one hand, and the consolidation of European integration, on the other, have created a more symmetrical and more equal institutional framework. Europe has more to offer than development aid. It has a unique experience of integration, dialogue and the construction of supranational political institutions, despite the fact that integration has sometimes been slow and has never been easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Second principle: partnership. The European Union and Africa share the same values and the same objectives. We believe in a much more multilateral world order, fairer development and the promotion of diversity. More than ever, our two continents must be strategic allies within the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Third principle: appropriation. Development policies and strategies cannot be imposed from the outside. The African Union’s and NEPAD’s vision of good governance, democracy and respect for human rights deserves the European Union’s support. This purely African initiative has brought a new dimension to the concept of appropriation as a basis for dialogue and cooperation with each country and region and with the continent as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The very wording of the strategy for Africa is the prime example of the way in which these three principles should be applied. I should also like to thank the regional organisations and the African Union for their exhaustive, constructive and judicious contribution to drawing up the document. Too often, strategies were prepared ‘in relation to’ or ‘for’ our African partners, rather than with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, in requesting, almost a year ago, the portfolio of European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, I was well aware that Africa would remain central to my action and commitment. I cannot conceal from you my satisfaction in seeing today that the entire European Commission has committed itself to this same effort. The joint meeting with the Commission of the African Union has shown just how motivated and committed my colleagues are. Europe now has an unprecedented opportunity to put a new partnership between the African and European continents in place. The Commission is presenting you with a plan, a vision and a coherent and integrated set of practical and ambitious proposals. It is now up to yourselves as Members of the European Parliament and of the Council to assume your responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years after the Cairo Summit, I think that the moment has come to convert our dialogue into action. We must work together in order to break the current deadlock and allow the Lisbon Summit to be held. A Lisbon Summit crowned with success will be a moment of great symbolic value in which we shall confirm the ever closer partnership between our two continents and in which we shall conclude a new and ambitious Euro-African pact.</p>

I think we should be pleased with a communication that proposes a long-term strategy to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in Africa. That is positive, and it is a sound initiative. What is needed to get sub-Saharan Africa on track is an ambitious plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should first of all like to comment on the procedure, which is, in fact, dreadful. The Commission presented the report today and values Parliament’s contribution, but if we want to make a contribution in time and present a position, we have already missed the boat for amendments. That is not an ideal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another tricky subject is that I have received complaints about the communication with the Africans. That should actually be impossible, and I am therefore curious as to how the report accommodates the 23 priorities formulated by the African Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been stated, a new strategy for Africa is urgently needed. Poverty is at its worst there, and growing. Much aid has already been given, but too little has been achieved. Whilst the report clearly pinpoints the problems and suggests helpful solutions, it cannot convince me that, as the Commissioner often tells us, this new strategy enables more to be done more effectively and more quickly, not least because of the expectations of our own European functioning. As the Commissioner said, coherence and coordination of our own policy are vital if we want to increase effectiveness. I doubt whether this new strategy really offers the right instruments for this. Much, however, will also depend on the political will of the Member States and of those responsible within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Africa is concerned, the Commission rightly refers to Africa’s versatility and the need for the African states to accept ownership. The primary responsibility is theirs. With regard to the strategy, the Commission does not draw sufficient distinction between the so-called stable states and the fragile states. Ownership is desirable in both cases. We in the European Union, though, will need to use a different set of instruments in both cases; hence the plea, in my report, for a dual approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right and proper that the Commissioner should mention the Millennium Development Goals as our starting point and our ultimate goal. That is why I am surprised at a number of proposals, for example where major infrastructural projects are concerned, exchanges between universities or the Nyerere or Erasmus programme. Whilst they are fine ideas, I cannot quite follow them where they concern priorities in the fight against poverty. My time is up. I am relying on the Commissioner, whom I would also like to thank for his involvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that for the first time we are being asked to tackle the issue of development in Africa on a multitude of interconnected levels, in a long-term plan. Let us hope that at the European Council in December this innovative approach receives resolute backing from the EU’s governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, we all know that in order to meet the majority of the Millennium Goals, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, focused commitment on development aid and a properly complementary approach to all kinds of intervention are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only should the quantity of aid be increased – here I agree with Commissioner Michel – but far greater efficiency also needs to be achieved. That can only happen within a context of European consensus, which can place every bilateral relation within an overall coherent framework. Naturally, it is within this context that there are the greatest difficulties, since the old vices of national interest are always liable to prevail over the virtues of a single European strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is even more important to place aid and development policies, over and above national interests – and I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to this point – under the principle of ownership, including budget aid: the Africans should be placed in a position to be able to build their own future and to assume full responsibility for it. One of these conditions, however, is a fairer global trade system, and here we can see a test shaping up for Europe, a test for Parliament and for the Commission: development policy cannot be separated from policy on the world trade system.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Europe will be able to play its role to the full at the next Hong Kong Conference, particularly with regard to issues that are decisive for the ownership of development policies by the African continent, such as the issue of duties, tariffs and export subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add that a special mission falls to this Parliament, in the face of European public opinion that is often apt to think that the situation in Africa is desperate. That is not the case and we should make it clear: Africa is a resource for us too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have therefore set Millennium Development Goals. I should like to draw your attention to the fact that these goals must not be seen as sacrosanct, because if, by any chance, we do not achieve them, there will be a sense of desperation and failure and we will be back to square one, which will be an extremely harmful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The formula for development is fairly well-known. Let us be humble, however, and point out firstly that, while public aid is undoubtedly a lever for development, the effect it has is miniscule in comparison to what private sector funds could do to develop Africa and, secondly, that we must be wary of tackling Africa, complex as it is, with simple ideas. That being said, it is not a useless exercise to point out some fundamental factors. Infrastructure is one of these factors. There is no doubt that we require road, port and airport infrastructure, communication infrastructure and health care infrastructure. Then comes security, and by that I mean the security of goods and persons, legal certainty, judicial security and banking security. Finally, a State is required: a State that undertakes its sovereign duties, pays its government officials and stands shoulder to shoulder with a civil society. We must therefore be the guardians of these fundamental factors.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to emphasise the quality of your communication, Commissioner, which exploits all of the EU’s resources. What it amounts to is an excellent diagnosis and a very good prescription, which says that the patient must continue with his treatment but that care must be taken that, having been cured, he does not then die. Money is not enough to prevent this from happening. It is not enough to mobilise funds. Africa must help itself. For our part, we must firstly have confidence in the institutions with which Africa is providing itself. Secondly, our policies must be coherent and coordinated. Thirdly, Africa must apply its own prescriptions, and by that I am referring, in particular, to the diagnosis provided by NEPAD. Finally, my fourth point is that the money is there, so let us stop casting blame.</p>
<p class="contents">The shift from 0.31% to 0.5% equates to EUR 20 billion: half of this amount will be devoted to Africa, which is a sum of EUR 10 billion. EUR 10 billion equates to one annual EDF funding allocation – the EDF receives EUR 13 billion for five years. We will thus be able to provide EUR 10 billion in funding each year for Africa. With the existing procedures and channels as they stand, it is impossible to invest and to spend these funds. This is demonstrated by the sum remaining of the EDF. Therefore, we must review our budgetary instruments for aid. Furthermore, I believe that we must not view budgetary support as a cure-all, without introducing an extremely strict control and monitoring procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Africa urgently needs our strong support, including technology transfer, debt cancellation, resources for development and fair terms of trade delivered in a coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope this strategy will deliver greater coherence and added value. However, I am not convinced, not least because it does not evaluate the impact of our past policies and does not foresee any additional financial instrument to deliver better policies in the future. What it offers is more of the same failed policies, because the shocking fact is that the number of people living in poverty in Africa continues to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need from the Commission is not a change of documents, but a change of policy, in particular trade policy, which continues to undermine Africa’s development potential. On economic partnership agreements, ACP countries must have the guarantee of continued non-reciprocal access if they choose it. At the World Trade Organization, the Commission must ensure that negotiations on non-agricultural market access take into full account the needs of African countries to protect their infant industries. On commodity prices, we must have action to reverse declining commodity prices. On services, the Commission must abandon its new benchmarking proposal that would force poorer countries to open their service sectors, in complete contradiction to what the Commission has guaranteed in the past about flexibility on services. On agriculture, of course, we need a complete end to export dumping, as well as support to African countries, to enable them to protect their agriculture up to the point of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation has failed to deliver growth or poverty eradication. A new strategy must be based on new values: the values of fair trade and cooperation, rather than free trade and more competition. That is what we need to see from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view this is another example of how we often concentrate on particular issues that we then abandon.</p>
<p class="contents">I must however say that I should also have liked to hear a mention of the movement in the past few days of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa, who encounter fences and barbed wire and often rubber or indeed real bullets, and of those who wander through the desert without food. In my opinion, the issue of immigration will have to be closely linked to the problems of development.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the work carried out by the Commission, especially Mr Michel, as being of paramount importance. As Mr Zani has already emphasised, I think it is essential to achieve coordination of development policies, not only as far as Africa is concerned but also in general. That being so, I strongly believe that the Council, Parliament and the Commission must work in unison, since in reality – as Mr Zani has noted – it is very often the Member States that have the upper hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the European Union is not the only major aid donor in Africa, the presence and the policies of such international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should also be reinforced. Their decisions have considerable impact on the lives of indigenous peoples and on the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen, debt cancellation is essential, though for the debtor countries it has been in reality only a first step. We must therefore also ensure that, within the framework of this new policy, we strive for a different definition of debt sustainability. The financial requirements of African countries must also be taken into consideration as an essential element. As is pointed out in the document in question, it would also be opportune to involve civil society and national parliaments more closely in putting together the country strategy paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Michel has mentioned peace, security and good government. The security issue must, however, be understood as pertaining to human security as well, not simply to the tragedies that have followed 11 September. Above all, I believe that our policies should consider a form of peace and security that, for example, accords with the definitions of official development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Very often we ourselves are responsible for the conflicts in Africa, above all bearing in mind that we continue to sell arms. This is therefore another area in which there must be very strict controls. Other Members have mentioned trade, which is certainly a fundamental instrument but which must not be confined solely to aid for trade: it must be equally fair to both parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I listened with interest to his speech and I support many of the things he said.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union plays a pivotal role in the area of development, providing 55% of world development aid, most of which goes to Africa. During the United Nations summit in New York in September 2005, the EU strongly affirmed its will to contribute to the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals. The first of these ambitious eight goals is the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. Halving world poverty between now and 2015 is a major challenge that faces us in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no question of the EU’s commitment to Africa and to the eradication of poverty. However, there is a severe lack of consolidated information on what we donors actually do in Africa. How sure is the European Union of the effectiveness and efficiency of its aid? I welcome the Commissioner saying that he intends to put in place an action plan on aid efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union donates more to Africa than any other institution or government in the world. Yet corruption steals so much of what we give to those who need it most. Donating vast sums of money is admirable, but it carries with it responsibilities: a responsibility on the part of the donor – ultimately you and I – and a responsibility on the part of the recipients, in this case Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an acute need for ownership, responsibility, accountability and leadership to be developed among the ruling governments and countries of Africa. The European Union needs to take a clinical approach to promoting good governance. The overriding objective of poverty reduction is based on the complementary aim of promoting good governance and respect for human rights. We need to reward the African countries that acknowledge the concept of democracy and respect for human rights and we must continue condemning corrupt regimes which are slowly but surely destroying their countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is nothing new; for years we have been witnessing the desperation that forces these men and women to risk their lives in order to enter Europe, or rather in order to escape Africa, despite the fact that Africa is their land.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this time we have been witnessing the rafts unloading African men and women on our coasts, and many bodies have been washed up there, having been swallowed up by the sea during their dramatic adventure. We now have the impression that this may not be something that involves hundreds or thousands of people, but that desperation could mobilise millions of people who have nothing to lose and who will stop at nothing in their quest for survival.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the world is organised in an immensely unjust manner, with increasing inequalities between the industrialised North and the under-developed South, and that that will inevitably have explosive consequences, is no longer something that is just stated by a few of us pioneers in world society: something that was being dealt with by specialists is now on the agenda of the generalists. But this is not a time for anticipating a crisis: the crisis is blowing up in our faces and has caught us without any clear idea of how to react. The strategy for Africa proposed by the Commission and the effort proposed by the British Presidency could respond to the need to react in the face of an issue about which the only clear thing is that we are facing a European problem for which that very European dimension is the only solution, the Union dimension, combined with that of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of Africa is vital for Africa, but also for Europe. The Commission’s communication is being presented, and it should be called ‘The European strategy for the development of Africa’. There is no question that it is late in coming, but better late then never.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being proposed to us seems to us to be sufficiently ambitious, but not sufficiently precise, and also long and, above all, complicated to organise; in any event, it is a step in the right direction. Let us hope that amongst all of us, and in particular here in the European Parliament, we are able to make the process as wide-ranging and specific as I believe it needs to be, supporting the good intentions of the Commission. It will also be essential to deal with the issue sufficiently quickly so that we can respond to an immense emergency which, furthermore, calls into question the credibility of the European Union and its ability to act in a manner that is consistent with its principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we are all delighted that there is now such a sharp focus – both political and, happily, also economic – on Africa. Unquestionably, quite extraordinary efforts are needed if Africa is to be lifted out of poverty, and it is therefore appropriate for the EU to prepare an overall strategy on our relations with Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal contains a lot that is good. Concerns for the environment, good governance, women and equality, peace-making, trade and the strengthening of the private sector have been crucial in taking developments forward, although I could have done with hearing a bit more about them in the Commissioner’s speech. However, an extremely alarming proposal was also put forward for more centralised planning in connection with EU aid to Africa using, for example, donor atlases, as if we in Europe could sit and make plans about the way in which aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries. That is directly contrary to the principles of aid effectiveness and sound donor behaviour on which the EU helped decide at the Paris High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in March of this year. The African countries should be at the centre of aid coordination, proceeding on the basis of their own strategies to combat poverty. If we scrap everything we have achieved in this area in order to speak with one voice as part of a top-down strategy, what we are in danger of seeing, instead of a competently conducted fight against poverty, is a whole caravan of white elephants invade the African continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission what basically is the meaning of the four points in paragraph 3.3 and whether these contradict what we have said so far, namely that it must be the countries’ own poverty strategies that form the basis for our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, there is education, education and education. Europe is hardly doing anything in this regard, but could be doing a great deal. Then there is the matter of combating diseases.

One thing in particular was the theme of respect and partnership; respect for the people of Africa and partnership with them. I would start by saying that if you talk to people from Africa, they say ‘too often you in Europe only talk about drought and famine and all the bad things about Africa, why do you not sometimes celebrate the good things about Africa?’. I think that is what the Commissioner was doing. It is what we should do. We should draw out the talents of Africans. We should build on the resources of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the Commissioner’s contribution and the communication. Clearly the Millennium Development Goals are fundamental to this. I would like to see even more emphasis on health and education; they were certainly highlighted in his speech, although they take a bit of finding. We went through peace, security, good governance, economic growth, trade and interconnection – whatever that means – before we got there. I am sure those things are all fundamentally important, but so too are health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">As a small example the twinning partnerships are highlighted. Yes, twinning partnerships are good: we have them recommended for schools and towns and even museums, why not for hospitals too? Why not for teaching hospitals, why not for health teams and NGOs in the health field?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see and hear more about the Commissioner’s previous commitments to me on neglected diseases and the reports we have brought through Parliament in the past. There is so much more to be done on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like finally to highlight one thing which has come from Africa itself, and that is its first food safety plan. We all often call for people to help Africa to make its food safe and secure; here they are doing something about it. However, if I just cite one figure: the failure to meet new food standards that came from the European Union in 2001 resulted in a 64% drop in exports from Africa of cereals, dried fruit and nuts – a loss of USD 670 million. That is just one example of why we need to work with Africa to use its talents to help Africans help themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, on trade, it is essential to end the subsidies to farmers in Europe which keep prices low and squeeze African commodities out of our markets, as well as the export subsidies that allow cheap food to be dumped in Africa. High tariffs, keeping out African goods, need to be cut, but African countries need time before opening up their markets. They do not have in place those safety nets, which we might have, to protect their workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need to urge Member States to sign up to the UN Convention on Corruption. Member States should be held responsible for corrupt practices by their own staff and agents. That does not appear in the report and I think it is something that Member States like my own should be urged to sign up to.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 9/11 there has been a tightening up on corruption, but it is still not treated with the same seriousness as terrorism or drugs. It also necessary for Europe to stop encouraging the brain-drain from Africa. This is not on the report either, but it makes an enormous difference, particularly in health services in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the arms trade, which nobody has mentioned. The arms and mines which are killing thousands of people and have done so in Africa over generations were mostly made in the Soviet Union. As we know, however, they are traded, dealt with and circulated around Europe. They are based in Europe. We must, as Europeans, do far more to control arms brokering and the transit trade which takes place from our own continent.</p>
<p class="contents">These are responsibilities that we must take as Europeans and we must not try to place the onus of responsibility simply on Africans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to caution against exaggerated confidence that foreign capital and companies will solve Africa’s problems. We must support the development of locally owned industry whose profits stay in Africa. It is important for them to be given complete freedom to choose the ways in which they wish to develop, free from pressure and the forced opening up of markets. They must themselves decide what is in their interests. A coherent strategy involving trade, development cooperation and support for democracy is required in order to give Africa that opportunity.</p>

By the same token, even the best aid programmes will be of no use if we do not help people there to help themselves, or if we fail to embed democracy and the rule of law there in such a manner that they are not fragile plants but can put down strong roots; what matters is that we should enable Africans to have a hand in shaping their own destiny and to take responsibility for how they do that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, as I see it, a disgrace that it is the most mobile who attempt to flee Africa, and that we are not making it possible for them, in the places from which they come, to make their mark on society and to advance it. It will not be possible for them to do any of these things unless we concentrate on ‘education, education, education’, particularly, I think, the education of young girls and women. The longer we send girls to school and the more developed and educated they become, not only will they be better able to bring up their children, but they will also have children at a later age, and that is a significant element in a society moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to concentrate our strengths; a policy in which the left hand does not know what the right is doing must be a thing of the past, and, most of all, we need a policy of optimism, and it is with that in mind that I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his paper, and on the confidence to which it gives voice. I do know, though, that, even with combined strengths, it will take a long time before Africa is where we would like it to be, and, on the way there, we must try to help Africa to avoid making all the mistakes that we made in the course of our history.

This is not a problem just for Spain and Morocco, and nor must it be seen purely from the perspective of controlling illegal migration. This is a problem for the entire Union and undermines our credibility on the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the words of Mr Michel, who rightly said that what we need is a coherent strategy for Africa; a strategy that enhances the effectiveness of our development policy and enables us to fulfil the Millennium Goals. If this strategy is to be achieved, it must be properly catered for in the Union’s budget, the Commission and the Member States must work more closely together, fair trade must be promoted and, in turn, the common agricultural policy must be reviewed, in light of the devastating impact that it has had on developing countries. It entails combating corruption, and that is something that must work both ways.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a strategy that puts the EU at the forefront of implementing the new concept of the responsibility to protect, which enhances the Union’s ability to maintain and build peace, in conjunction with the African Union. An integral part of this strategy is fighting against the impunity of those responsible for crimes against humanity, by making use of the International Criminal Court and other courts. There are impending test cases such as those of Hissène Habré, Charles Taylor and the perpetrators of Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a Union that provides more practical support for electoral processes, civil society, NGOs, democratic institutions, the empowerment of women and good governance in Africa. Lastly, we need a European Union that promotes worldwide peace and security, and that stops terrorism in its tracks in Africa. The underlying causes of terrorism must be addressed, along with, once and for all, arms proliferation in the African continent, that is, arms exports from Europe as well as from elsewhere, which are fuelling the conflicts that are destroying Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Ceuta, Melilla and Lampedusa raise serious questions about security in Africa and our security. The migrants and refugees who are fleeing are doing so because they are desperate, and they are desperate partly due to Europe’s silence and intransigence, the conflict in Western Sahara being a case in point. This is the same despair and anger that fans the flames of international terrorism, whose recruits manage to find a way into Europe, however high the continent builds the walls at its borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would cite the example of Nigeria, which has the largest population and which, although one of the wealthiest African countries in terms of its resources, has not seen the development that it requires.

I wish to raise five points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the EU is Africa’s most important supplier of aid, and that is how it should be, for historical reasons. The fact that we have 26 different development policies, however, tends to hamper efficiency. We need to combine forces and invest our efforts in one common development policy, which is also something the Commission is in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that the ‘Euro-Africa Pact’ proposed by the Commission in its communication seems like an excellent idea. It should be based on an equal partnership between the European Union and the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I want to say that the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Round of talks now in progress needs to achieve results that will improve the Africans’ chances of operating in global markets. This means putting an end to protectionist customs duties and export restitutions, for example, in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I want to say that peace, stability, healthcare and good governance are priority goals for many still unstable African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that it is ultimately the Africans themselves who are responsible for development in Africa. With this in mind, initiatives such as NEPAD – ‘The New Partnership for Africa's Development’ – are of crucial importance and very worthwhile. I therefore support the Commission on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to make two specific observations. Firstly, with regard to the biblical drama we are witnessing — mass emigration of people fleeing, in the Sahel in particular, from hunger, from locusts, from wars and from drought — the European States have a minimal presence in the States of the south of the Sahel, including in diplomatic terms. I therefore believe that we must take urgent action, which the Commission must initiate.</p>

<p class="contents">Where the last colony in Africa, the Western Sahara, is concerned, I believe that we – by which I mean not only the European Union as an institution, but also the Member States – are not making a good job of it.

Yet, the results were insignificant. The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved, and Africa is, once again, the big loser in all of this. The desperate situation in Africa has recently been illustrated by images on our television screens: images of men prepared to die on the barbed fencing of our continent in order to gain better prospects and a future for themselves and their children, as well as for their country and their continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that, in order to help Africa overcome poverty, war, hunger and violence, a process and financial resources must be put in place. We have known what our responsibilities are for a long time. The European Union has a long tradition of promoting development in the African continent, but the results have generally fallen short of the mark. You have declared, Commissioner, that your plan would attempt to strike a balance between social objectives and economic development. I am not one of those people who believe that economic liberalisation automatically leads to social progress and, while we are on that subject, I am concerned about the free trade agreements with the ACP countries. I believe that our investments need to be focused primarily on education, training, research, health care and public services. We must – and I believe that this is one of your priorities – make sure that the funds are used and distributed more effectively, that there is better governance and, in fact, that transparent and peaceful democracies are established.</p>
<p class="contents">I have faith, Commissioner, in your political will. I would, however, like you to clarify a few points for us. How do you intend to deal with the diversity of the African countries? More specifically, what is the link between this general plan and various partnerships already in existence? How should we deal with the debt issue, since, in my opinion, this aspect is not sufficiently addressed in the plan? In short, what practical implementation will take place and what resources will be allocated to this strategy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by responding to the speeches made by Mrs Morgantini and by the last speaker, who both made reference to what is currently taking place at the gates of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am like you. I am one of those people who believe that the real answer to the desperation or futile hopes of human beings is obviously not to close our doors or to act brutally or inhumanely. The real answer lies in strong development policies, very forceful policies that open up prospects in the countries in which the migratory flows originate. That is the answer, and the strategy I presented to you provides, in my opinion, an ambitious response to the desire to find a sustainable way of resolving these kinds of tragedy, injustice and unfairness. It therefore goes without saying that I share your alertness to these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed these matters a short while ago with Mr Konaré, between the Commission of the African Union and the Commission of the European Union, and we would be somewhat well advised to bear in mind, as you, yourselves, have, that the problem is not limited to Spain or to Morocco: this is a problem affecting the whole of Africa and the whole of the European Union. If we do not have the political capacity to resolve this issue at EU level in the context of a real partnership and a real political dialogue with the African continent, then we will never find a solution. We will constantly live through tragedies of this kind and we will continue – justifiably - to attract scorn, because we will have been incapable of carrying out a crucial task.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I must say to you that I cannot fall into the trap that might be set for me – albeit unconsciously, or at any rate involuntarily - in Parliament. I believe that matters must be clear between us with regard to this point: I do not want my plan for Africa to become a kind of Christmas tree to which every MEP, pressure group, NGO or member of civil society comes to hang his or her bauble, at the risk of our losing sight of the main point. What I truly hope to do, thanks to this plan – and I call on you to help me with this – is to define a course, a framework, without setting any priorities or excluding anything. I also hope that people will not be able to obscure the broad outline by adding all sorts of things which, in themselves, are clearly extremely important, but which could overshadow the main point.</p>
<p class="contents">Members have spoken about the effectiveness of the strategy. You cannot call on the Commissioner to stand firm on issues that are not entirely within his control. As regards the Commission, you simply have my good will and my commitment. I also call on you to do something: to help me to succeed in convincing the Member States. What is, in fact, perhaps unusual about the proposal I am making is that I am trying to outline a framework, a common strategy between the Commission and the Member States to enable the work on promoting development to be divided up more effectively. Here is my plan: to try to have, and to develop, together a framework, objectives and a strategy and, within that strategy, to try to appeal to groups of Member States that are more specifically interested in such and such a sector or in such and such a region and see to it that we can divide up the work more effectively. That would also enable us to make savings prior to all the processes, projects and procedures for examining files which, otherwise, it must be said, give rise to a great deal of duplication of effort, coinciding tasks and administrative work. All the same, I would point out that, today, we have 26 different sets of regulations. That is what our partners are confronted with.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like this plan to do is to create the momentum and political will needed to reduce all of these sets of regulations, to bring them in line with each other and to simplify them. We would make great gains in efficiency and, above all, our policy would be more effective. Consequently, the Member States will have a crucial role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone asked me, rather oddly, why I should focus on infrastructure. We need to know what is desired. I believe, in fact, that we all agree that the principle of appropriation is essential. We all agree that the people of Africa must tell us what their priorities are as far as they are concerned. Well, – and I am addressing the person who questioned me slightly oddly on this issue – the people of Africa have asked us precisely to focus on infrastructure as a priority. I would also say to you that one does not need to be African to understand the importance of that decision. Anyone who goes to Africa or who is well acquainted with the heart of Africa can see that, as long as there are no trans-African networks or trans-African communities, there will be no economic restructuring in Africa; we might as well forget about it. That is therefore the reason why we are focusing on infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that this in no way means that we have forgotten about education or health care. I fully agree with the Members who took the floor on this subject and, if there is, in fact, anyone who is alert to it, it is myself. I should like to refer you to page 33 of the document in which it is explained at great length that we will obviously be focusing on education. Moreover, why should I want us to spend a day together debating the priority to be allocated to budgetary aid when this is possible? It is precisely to ensure that the countries, the States, can implement sovereign policies in the area, for instance, of education. It is also to ensure that they can fund their teachers and can pay their teachers, which is often not the case at present. Thus, you can be assured that I am extremely conscious of the priority given to education. I cannot draw up an exhaustive list of all the priorities, but rest assured that I share them. I wanted to make that point clear.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to natural resources, you will see in the document that we plan to include among the conditions attached to budgetary aid for partner countries the requirement that they allocate the income generated from their natural resources to their national budgets. You are entirely justified in emphasising this matter. It is totally unfair that, in a number of potentially wealthy countries possessing natural resources, which are, unfortunately, often misappropriated or sometimes plundered, there is no trace of these resources in their national budgets, when the resources could fund the sovereign policies about which we have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I should still like to address two aspects, beginning with weapons. I should like to qualify what I have heard here. When it is said that Europe might be one of the suppliers of weapons to Africa, I, having full knowledge of the facts, strongly deny that assertion. I do not dispute the fact that there are countries in the European neighbourhood that are selling off the stocks of a former era. I acknowledge the fact that there exists an illegal trade, which we are, moreover, trying hard to combat. Yet, I would remind you that, at European level, there is a code of ethics that the Member States have undertaken to observe. Thus, in principle, when a country in Africa or elsewhere is in conflict, the Member States of the European Union cannot grant licences for exports to that country. That is what I wanted to say, and we are going to continue our work along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark concerns trade. It is clear that the WTO negotiations must put development at the top of their list of concerns. I assure you that my colleague, Mr Mandelson, does so, and we of course support him. To give you an example: we are the global leaders in terms of trade-related aid. I would remind you of the statement made by Mr Barroso at the G8 Summit: we donate EUR 1 billion per year. I would remind you of another obvious fact: we are the only group of countries in the world that practices the ‘Everything but Arms’ process. As regards agricultural policy, there exists an agreement in principle on the Doha Agenda and there has been a reform of the CAP, which is already a great step forward. Is it enough? Undoubtedly it is not, but neither must we demonstrate naïve optimism. We must be aware of the fact that the interests of Europe and of certain countries are a factor and that it is this that is preventing us from making faster and more far-reaching progress. We need to be aware of that. I do not believe that it is helpful to bury our heads in the sand with regard to what is really taking place in different countries in terms of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic partnership agreements - the EPAs – their goal is development, in particular through aid for regional integration. For example, promoting South-South trade is one of the priorities of the Africans. President Konaré fully explained this to us this morning. Obviously, there will be adjustment costs, and we will help them on this score as well.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that is obviously very ideological and I always have great respect for ideological ‘extremes’, because I can understand them. They come from the heart, which commands a great deal of respect on my part and a great deal of understanding. That being said, is the current system helping the developing countries? I would draw your attention to the fact that, despite all our preferences and despite all the systems of preference in place, there has been no end to the decline in the contribution of our ‘preferential’ partners to international trade. We must provide them with the resources really to adapt and to become part of the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by making a final remark, because I believe that it is important: it is not the small ACP countries that will benefit the most from these preferences, but the large exporting countries like Brazil. This demonstrates that subtle distinctions are useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have perhaps run over slightly and I apologise for that. However, there were so many good questions that I wanted to attempt to answer as many of them as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, it unveils its ‘Strategy for Africa’, preaching with sheer effrontery about good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with African democracy, the Commission has the nerve to say, is ‘limited information’ and "endemic corruption"; there is a ‘crisis of legitimacy’, with a ‘growing disconnect between the “legality” of the state apparatus and its legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary people.’</p>

<p class="contents">So I say to the Commission – and to all the politicians in this Parliament who share Mr Juncker's view – Africa does not need any lessons from you, but if you really want to set an example, accept defeat on the Constitution. Face up to the fact that voters put you on the losing side. And before you preach any more sermons, start addressing your own bad governance here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
