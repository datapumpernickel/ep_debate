<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council Decision which is before the House today marks the culmination of a long process. A moment ago we were arguing about whether it was 25 years or 30 years. Either way it has been a long process.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1960, when the draft convention on election to Parliament by universal suffrage was adopted, our House has produced five reports which have ended up deadlocked within the Council. At last the Spanish Presidency has achieved a laborious agreement within the Council. We must celebrate this and congratulate the presidency on this delicate manoeuvring.</p>
<p class="contents">This text includes the majority of the proposals the European Parliament had made in the Anastasopoulos report. Specifically, it introduces the principle of proportional representation with each Member State having a choice about the type of preferential list it wishes, the incompatibility of the status of a Member of a national parliament with that of a Member of the European Parliament, with exceptions for the United Kingdom and Ireland until the 2009 elections, the power of each Member State to set the ceiling for the electoral expenses of candidates and the power of each Member State to create territorial constituencies which do not affect in a general sense the proportional nature of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It also brings the 1976 Act into line with the changes introduced by the successive Treaties in the institutions and bodies of the Union and an intelligent solution is found for compliance with the 'Matthews' judgment on the vote of the electorate of Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Parliament’s other proposals have not been included, such as the single constituency for the whole of the European Union, the movement of elections to the month of May and the objective of parity between men and women on electoral lists. Some people will therefore say that this is a minimal agreement, but the rapporteur believes that it is better to take a step forward towards a more homogenous electoral system, than to remain in the blind alley we were trapped in.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how the European Union has acted, moving forward prudently, sometimes excessively so, but moving forward nonetheless, like tortoises, slowly but surely. Of course the assent does not mean renouncing Parliament’s positions. The rapporteur has opted to re-state them in the recitals, improved by the contributions of the members of the committee, whom I would like to warmly and expressly thank for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not purely rhetorical demands. The draft Decision lays down that the Act would be subject to a new review before 2009, by which time Parliament’s demands could be incorporated. For all these reasons, I would ask you to support the assent in favour of the draft Decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by mentioning a proposal by President Delors, which could be a shot in the arm for the European elections: it simply consists of doing at Union level what is done in the Member States, that is, that the head of the electoral cartel should be proposed by the President of the Commission. The vote would therefore leave behind the realms of abstract notions and purely national references and give the Union a public face. I have included this proposal in the recitals, with the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I strongly believe that it is time that the citizens understood who they are voting for and why.</p>

<p class="contents">President Gil Robles, whom I would like to congratulate as rapporteur for this parliamentary assent, has said that many drafts have become deadlocked. I remember how a distinguished British Conservative, Edmund Burk, said that Spain was like a whale washed up on the shores of Europe (or something like that, I am quoting from memory). Therefore, I am very pleased that it is the Spanish Presidency that has managed to break the deadlock on this issue and that in 2002, under the Spanish Presidency, we will have the first reform of the Electoral Act.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is one of the few cases in which the European Parliament is called upon to issue an assent, that is to say, to vote yes or no, and, furthermore, so that this assent may have legal results, there must be an absolute majority in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the conflict the European Parliament was faced with: what to do. As the rapporteur said, it is true that not all of the aspirations of the European Parliament contained in its previous report, drawn up by our friend and former colleague, Mr Georgios Anastasopoulos, have been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that it was necessary to adapt this Electoral Act to the various and successive modifications of the Treaties. And it is also the case that we had to comply with a mandate and resolve an issue which stemmed from a judgment of a Court – in this case the Strasbourg Court – and therefore adapt our electoral system to the judgment in the Matthews case. That is what is being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I believe that most of the considerations expressed by the European Parliament on these issues, in its previous report, since the Treaty of Amsterdam modified the uniform electoral system in accordance with the general principles of electoral law, appear in the spirit and the letter of the text before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Peoples’ Party is therefore going to vote in favour, and it is true that there will be time to accommodate other requests from the European Parliament in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The historic nature of this moment, however, does not end there, because the Group of the European Peoples’ Party is going to support an amendment presented by Mr Bonde – a very unusual thing in this Parliament – because we think it is a good amendment, an amendment in which Mr Bonde says and maintains that those Members of Parliament elected in the territory of a State represent the whole of the electorate, something which, by the way – and this brings me back to what I said at the beginning – was also advocated by Edmund Burk in his comments to the voters of Bristol in 1794.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would therefore like to say that my group will vote in favour of this assent which Mr Gil Robles has drawn up with such skill and dexterity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work. He is wise to recommend that Parliament gives its assent to the position that the Council has adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the only areas under the Treaty where it is the Parliament and not the Commission which has the right of initiative. We took this initiative some years ago, the Council has acted on our text, and indeed incorporated most of the essential elements that we wished to see incorporated into the uniform electoral system, or at least the common principles for the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Our argument that proportional representation should be obligatory in every Member State is accepted. I come from the last Member State to have introduced proportional representation for European elections and am glad that this will now be recognised as a principle to be applied across all Member States. It also recognises that so that not everything is done at the level of highly centralised national lists, regional constituencies, which are closer to the people, should be possible, especially in the larger Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also recommends that we bring to an end, although this will be phased in, the dual mandate whereby Members sit both in the European Parliament and in their national parliament. That is an attempt to do two full-time jobs at once: it is no longer feasible, it is no longer tenable and it is right to phase it out.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we can approve this text although it is not fully satisfactory in every respect, but that is part of the give and take of the European Union, part of the process of accommodation that we go through and we can accept it. My group will therefore be voting for the report by Mr Gil-Robles.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a problem, however, with recital D. This recital begins by stating that we regret that the single European constituency, which Parliament proposed, will not be introduced. The problem here is that Parliament did not propose that, Parliament said that it was something that could be examined for the future, as of the 2009 elections. The text even says that we regret that it is not to be introduced in time for the next European elections, when we did not even envisage it as a possibility for the next European elections. If we are serious as a parliament, even those amongst us who support the idea of 10% of the seats being elected in this way, we should take this particular recital out of the text because it actually contradicts the facts and our proposals. We will be doing ourselves no good by regretting that the Council did not approve something which we did not even propose. With that small reservation, I can support the text and my group will be voting in favour of the rest of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The British also accept that they have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of Gibraltar can be represented in this place. I trust that the participation of Gibraltar within the European political system will soften some of the nationalistic tensions we have seen in that part of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Several States have quite properly conceded the end of the dual mandate. This practice is contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and impairs Parliament's efficiency. So I congratulate the rapporteur and the Belgian and Spanish presidencies for brokering the agreement. I look forward to a further review of the uniform electoral procedure, by which time I trust that the Convention will have established the argument for regional seats in the larger States as well as for some element of a transnational list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we have made progress with regard to Gibraltar, and I am pleased for our British and Spanish friends, as well as for the people of Gibraltar.

What is more, how can we explain that a very flexible mandate incompatibility system will preserve overlaps between the offices of members of a national parliament and Members of the European Parliament for a long time to come? Lastly, how can we explain to the female half of the human race that European electoral law says nothing about gender equality? I am glad to say that these points are included in the rapporteur’s resolution, but we are quite aware that these are only recitals and that the Council and the Member States can do with them as they will.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the attention of the Council to one point: territorial division. It is said, in French at least, that this will not affect the essentially proportional nature of the voting system. The word ‘essentially’ is interesting, firstly because it was not translated into all languages; some Council versions even omitted the adverb. Moreover, what is meant by ‘essentially’? This concept means that in effect, by chopping up the electoral territory, we may well end up with lists of two or three MEPs in a constituency, meaning that the electoral threshold will become 20 or 30%. This will certainly simplify debates in this Chamber tremendously, but to the detriment of representativeness. There is no point to proportionality unless it guarantees that citizens are properly represented.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are trying to combat this threshold effect in the recitals that have been adopted, and I would like to thank officially our rapporteur and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs while hoping that the Council will come round to this position. That is why my group has not yet decided whether to vote to endorse this mediocre text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My personal view is that the compromise achieved in Council is, as a whole, acceptable, representing as it does a move towards a more homogeneous European electoral system.</p>
<p class="contents">The ruling on the incompatibility of membership of the European Parliament and of a national parliament simultaneously was long overdue. What is particularly heartening is that Gibraltarian citizens can at last take part in European elections. I very much hope that the citizens of the candidate countries will be able to vote in the 2004 elections and that the accession negotiations will not be delayed. I am concerned, though, about my government's present activities and I call upon it not to jeopardise the timetable for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to address four issues on which my group takes the view that there is an urgent need to change electoral law. Firstly, we reject minimum thresholds as being undemocratic, putting smaller parties at a disadvantage and hampering political pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is high time that the right to vote in European elections at last ceased to be restricted to EU citizens. It is incomprehensible that people from third countries who have been living and working in our Member States for many years, are still denied the right to vote and stand for election. Why do we not, at last, make an advance towards integration here, especially in view of the menacing increase in hostility towards foreigners in our Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the voting age needs to be reduced. At the end of April, the Council of the European Youth Forum addressed itself to the Convention, calling for the age for voting and standing for office to be reduced to 16. I support this demand by young people and hope that the Youth Convention in July will also put all its weight behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the recitals refer to the equality of men and women as being a problem, and rightly so. I believe it is not acceptable that women make up only some 30% of the Members of this House. It is for the political parties to put men and women on an equal footing by revising their own rules for drawing up the list of candidates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pasqua (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, ladies and gentlemen, this report does not seem to me to be very appropriate as, although, strictly speaking, there is no uniform electoral procedure, the European elections have nonetheless been organised on very widely accepted common principles since 1999. Why, therefore, produce yet another report on a matter that has been discussed numerous times, except to try to re-launch an integration process that seems even more doomed than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">We could talk at length about the grounds for a move that arbitrarily imposes proportional representation and, even more controversially, the territorialisation of constituencies in the more populous Member States, by means of Community law. I would like to emphasise that there is nothing, except reasoning that is as simplistic as it is erroneous, to suggest that this measure would bring the elected closer to the electorate or this being one of the desired objectives, that it would increase participation in European elections. Single or regionalised constituencies, proportional or majority voting: since 1979, every permutation has been tried, to no avail. We must therefore accept that tinkering with the electoral laws will not create an artificial feeling of belonging to the European Union or reduce the colossal abstention that affects the legitimacy of Parliament. Having said that, I would more specifically like to highlight two aspects that I consider unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the unlikely idea of a single European constituency for the election of 10% of the seats in Parliament, which I am glad to say was rejected by the Council but which is nonetheless referred to by the rapporteur. Not only does this proposal run entirely counter to the objective of territorialisation – the single European constituency would distance its Members from their voters, whereas territorialisation aims, on the contrary, to bring them closer – but it also ignores Article 189 of the Treaty on the European Communities. In effect, while the latter stipulates that Parliament must be composed of representatives of the people of the Member States of the Community, it is being proposed that we elect stateless Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point with which I thoroughly disagree concerns the reflections on the role of the European political parties, which the rapporteur invites to announce a candidate for the Commission Presidency in future election campaigns. I note that this initiative constitutes a further violation of the Treaty, which gives the governments of the Member States the power to choose the person they wish to appoint as president of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I believe that this ridiculous idea is dangerous, not to say perverse, as, by usurping a responsibility reserved for the Member States, it introduces a party system, and its inevitable corollary, an Assembly Government, at European level. The participation of the European parties in voting is something that could possibly be considered, but their involvement in the workings of the Community institutions must be firmly opposed. That is why, with regret, I cannot echo the compliments addressed to our rapporteur – although my criticism is by no means personal – and I therefore conclude that this report must be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This draft decision of the Council and the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado make a good impression: utopia, the need for proximity, the idea that we could move towards a European democracy, that we could have someone at the top of the list who would be president of the Commission; all these ideas are as far from reality as utopia was from the ideas of the contemporaries of Thomas More. Behind this utopia, there is reality, a raw, pragmatic reality; it is quite simply the desire of the large European parties to gain a stranglehold over the European Parliament, the desire of the Party of European Socialists and the European People’s Party to appropriate democracy in Europe through territorialisation which, by raising the thresholds, will, in effect, give them a duopoly over European democracy, with the rather spiteful complicity of the Greens, who are hoping to close the gap between themselves and the leading parties in a European constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reality, ladies and gentlemen: the confiscation of European democracy by European political parties which are entirely removed from the political reality of European citizens. This appropriation would be complemented by the funding system which would enable political funds to be reserved for these parties. What we are witnessing here is a hold-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In effect, this draft, in its current wording, seems to be flexible enough to respect the sovereignty of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, assent would go hand in hand with a number of controversial recitals, for example the recital lamenting the fact that the Council draft does not stipulate the possibility of transnational European lists. On the contrary, we think that these lists would only increase the isolation of the European Parliament from voters in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have one regret, it is that the Council has forgotten to note that, pursuant to Articles 189 and 190 EC, even in cases where a country creates regional constituencies for the European elections, these Members represent their whole country and not just their constituency, as Mr Méndez de Vigo pointed out earlier. In any case, this rule is there, since it is enshrined in the Treaty, but we have still submitted an amendment to recall its presence to make sure it is not overlooked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sensible solutions keep getting tangled up in the institutional undergrowth. Parliament may well have the right of initiative under the European Treaties, but it is the Council that must come to a decision – a unanimous one.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as four years ago, we discharged our obligations with the Anastassopulos report, but the Council of Ministers has taken a very, very long time to do something about its own. Now it has managed to come up with something, we are glad that we at last have a uniform electoral system in time for the 2004 elections, but I must warmly thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado for having raised the matters that Parliament has so long called for, but which have unfortunately not been taken up. Thus, there is nothing left to us other than to accept or reject the Council proposals; in other words, it is a case of ‘sink or swim’.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we have to admit that a number of points have been taken on board, matters are as unsatisfactory as ever they were.</p>
<p class="contents">This report adds Parliament to the roll of those who have called on the Convention to revise the provisions on EU election law in the Treaty establishing the European Communities. According to the treaties, Parliament has the right of initiating electoral legislation, and it is not acceptable that it no longer has a part in reaching final decisions. Matters of such fundamental importance to Parliament require that Parliament be given the full right of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I can hardly resist saying that the proposed wording concerning the introduction of territorial constituencies, with the protocol on the subject, brings the thorny issue of Great Britain and Gibraltar nearer to a solution. It is indeed sad that a country like Great Britain, with centuries of experience of Empire and a centuries-old tradition of democracy needs a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights to remind it of its greater responsibilities beyond the bounds of its own territory. This solution means that the citizens of Gibraltar will at last be able to participate in elections to the European Parliament. This is certainly a success for democracy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the actual Council proposal which we need to agree on still contains a number of items that leave room for improvement. Parliament has in any case expressed its thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The European elections have in recent years consistently been typified by a low turn-out. In my own country, the Netherlands, the turn-out in 1999 was only 30%. In other countries, the situation was similarly disappointing. In order to boost the numbers in 2004, the elections must in any case become a great deal more exciting and more political. The citizen must have the sense that by casting their vote, they can leave their mark on European policy and on the solution to the problems that are crying out for European cooperation, including asylum, food safety and the environment. This should, firstly, be done by allowing Parliament to appoint the President of the European Commission on the basis of the results of the elections. This is why in the report, all European political parties are urged to make their candidates known for this position well beforehand. This gives the candidates a human face, makes them known and ultimately, brings the Commission closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The day on which the elections are held is also extremely important in connection with identifying with the European project. Only when we all vote on the same day will the people have the sense that they are voting for one and the same political body. Most countries already vote on the same day, namely Sunday. It is regretful that a limited number of countries, including Ireland, the UK and my own country, the Netherlands, do not go to the ballot boxes on the same day as other European Member States – namely Sunday – and that the sense of excitement is thus lost. The reason is that apparently, we do want to open the supermarkets for commerce on Sundays, but if respect for democracy is at stake, the Netherlands is not interested. I would therefore make an appeal to put respect for democracy before commercial interests in the Netherlands and go to the ballot box on Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I mooted the idea in the Netherlands last week to have the national Commissioner of the European Commission directly elected by referendum. It is, in my view, an outmoded notion that such an important, politically recognisable figure should be appointed behind closed doors by government representatives. This is why I call for a referendum that coincides with the Parliament elections in 2004, where direct votes can be cast for a candidate. This idea is naturally not only for Dutch purposes, but also for other European countries. I hope that my fellow MEPs are willing to think this through very carefully, as I believe this to be an interesting idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does state that it is possible to establish regional constituencies for elections, whereby, however – and I quote – “the proportional representation of political families at Member State level must not be undermined”.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I point out that in the Belgian system, Member State level for European elections is totally irrelevant? Dutch-speakers and French-speakers go to the ballot boxes in two separate constituencies for elections which are totally unrelated to each other. In my opinion, recital C is a liberal interpretation of Article 2 of the Council’s draft decision. Moreover, the different language versions – just read the French, Dutch and English versions – are not identical.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Free Alliance is also struggling with the reference to transnational lists in recital D. In our opinion, this practice will lead to an even greater erosion of political diversity in this hemisphere. Indeed, it is making it even more difficult for smaller political formations to obtain seats at transnational, national and regional level, certainly when this is combined with the 5% electoral threshold. This is why the ten MEPs of the European Fee Alliance will not be endorsing the present recommendation by Mr Gil Robles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These efforts were based on the provisions of the Treaty of Maastricht through which an attempt was made, albeit unsuccessfully in Denmark, to make the electorate and the world around us believe that developing European political parties was an important integration factor. Through these manoeuvres, aimed at developing a political and parliamentary division, the intention is to create a European political identity. This political architecture is back to front. It is like a builder starting with the top floor and building downwards, rather than beginning at ground level. These efforts are doomed to fail. They are succeeded by a long list of initiatives regarding European political parties, but politics is not founded on the basis of preconceived resolutions concerning a European construction whose top floor presumably belongs in the stratosphere. The most recent historical precedent for this form of back-to-front political architecture is the Tower of Babel which, as is well known, did not work out very well, with the construction’s never being finished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly unfortunate, because this was a very sound point and would also have given us the opportunity, for example, to have a new President of the European Commission directly elected via the political parties and via a European list. It appears that the Council wants to hold on to this power and continue the undemocratic manner in which the President, and also many members of the Commission are appointed. This is unfortunate. I specifically say ‘many’ members, for I also know that a number of the members of the Commission, like Mrs De Palacio, <span class="italic">have</span> been directly elected on the European lists. They are therefore not all there without a mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate nevertheless, and maybe the only way to correct this is to ask the Convention to look into this matter. In my view, it is very important that the members of the European Commission should be democratically legitimised, like the MEPs. This could enhance public support for the Commission’s work and can also help the members of the Commission take more account of public opinion, as this is done by MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea mooted by Mr van den Berg to solve this by holding a referendum is an interesting one in itself, but I should like to say straight away: you were in government for eight years with your party. You could have organised it all, but you did not. It is interesting that you should now ask the former opposition to organise this, and I will certainly pass on the message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are all the more surprised to learn that these things are laid down on a national rather than European basis. Elections to Europe's Parliament are conducted nationally with 15 different procedures which will be 25 once enlargement has taken place, and although we are doing the same work here, the way we are treated varies widely. This makes it high time for us to get a European statute on MEPs and their work and, of course, for the procedure for European Parliamentary elections to be standardised to make it representative of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, who has made an important contribution to our next step towards a uniform election system. I also want to point out the remaining loopholes that the Council has left. One of them is the absence of Europe-wide lists in European elections. We are all aware that the last European elections were almost purely national in character, dealing with internal policy disputes and having very little to do with what we are doing here and with what we are here for. It is only when we have Europe-wide lists that the European parties will make the effort, and will endeavour to mobilise the public without reference to national borders. This has not been achieved. We urgently call on the Council to introduce Europe-wide lists when the electoral system is next revised.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr van den Berg that it is impossible for us to vote from Thursday to Sunday, with the result being announced only after the votes cast on Thursday have been recorded on Sunday evening. What has been put before us is a first step, and a good one. The second step must be taken as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A quite disproportionately small part of the Convention's work will be devoted to preparing solutions to the issues now raised in the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report – a uniform system for elections to Parliament, which will then truly merit the name of ‘European’, solutions under the heading of ‘regionalisation’ to the system's proximity – or lack of it – to the citizens, and to the problem of how to make it possible to use the elections to the European Parliament to reach a decision on how to give Europe a face, that is, by the direct election of the President of the Commission. There is, alas, nothing of any real substance on the subject of European lists. Work on these few topics has to date taken the Council and Parliament almost thirty years, not always with much by way of results. <span class="italic">Vive la différence</span> is still the watchword for the organising of elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from many other aspects, it is precisely this bewildering array of proceedings every fifth June that makes it easy for the European public to regard European elections as unimportant or incomprehensible. Turnouts of under 50% are their reaction to this deplorable state of affairs. What is to be done under such circumstances? Do we put a brave face on a bad job, rejoice in small improvements, thank the rapporteur for his good work and await the miracle that the Convention will bring to pass in fifteen months' time, changing everything and making it better?</p>
<p class="contents">I accept the compromise and join in thanking our rapporteur Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, and I call on everyone to wish the Convention and its members success in making the impossible possible, giving Europe a comprehensible and workable structure that the citizen can understand, with electoral laws by which the public will know themselves to be challenged to join in deciding what the future of our shared European home should be.</p>

<p class="contents">The assent we are going to give on the amendment of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament is part of a strategy of small steps. A small step is better than nothing but, quite frankly, the text should have been better. Why are the ideas of mixed voting and of transnational lists combined with proportional lists in a regional context not accepted? If we want to establish a European public space, we need to bring to life political parties that have a goal, that of electing the representatives of the peoples of Europe to the European Parliament. If we want to bring to life the concept of European citizenship, this public space needs to be fed with elected representatives, on a basis of transnational constituencies contributing to the appointment of a Commission president.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to equality, I believe the decision could have been bolder and could have proposed a rule of equality for European elections. On the matter of privileges and immunity, I regret that this amendment of the Act does not make any progress possible when, indeed, we are experiencing difficulties due to the absence of European rules in this field on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like us to agree on the designation. We should be referred to as 'European Members of Parliament' or 'Members of the European Parliament', not 'representatives' or 'Members'.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains is to hope that this small step will lead to further small steps when the Act is re-examined or within the context of the work of the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, every other state has a national assembly elected by a uniform method. But I hope Members will acknowledge that this is not the only legitimate view of the European Union. Some of us see this Parliament not as a federal assembly, but as a forum wherein the representatives of the peoples of Europe may hold the EU bureaucracy to account.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of a Member of the European Parliament is not to be an agent for the European project; it is to represent the interests of his constituents. I was elected to speak for south east England in Brussels, not to speak for Brussels in south east England. That is why I believe that it should be up to each Member State to decide how and when to select its MEPs. I personally favour a majoritarian first-past-the-post voting system. But even if I did not, I would still object to any method being imposed by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it the business of this House to dictate the gender composition of electoral lists. It is surely up to each party to decide how many men and women it wants to offer as candidates and up to voters to pass judgment on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I object to the reiteration of this Parliament's demand for a pan-European top-up list. This, it seems to me, elevates the dogma of European integration above any practical considerations of accountability or responsiveness. There can be no European democracy as long as there is no European demos. We delude ourselves if we believe that this House commands anything like the affinity and identity which national parliaments have built up over the centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament could perform a useful role scrutinising the budget and holding the Commission to account. I only wish that the House were more interested in carrying out the functions which it already has, rather than constantly demanding new powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? For a politically very important reason, I believe: if we want to launch any initiative or send any message to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, we must do so now.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day and every week we are hearing all types of messages which argue that the composition of this House leads to democratic deficit. It is said for example that the democratic deficit must be overcome by strengthening the national parliaments’ capacity to act within the processes of European construction. It is even said openly that the citizens believe that the national Members of Parliament truly represent them rather than European ones, forgetting that they both derive their legitimacy from the same source: universal suffrage and the political will of the citizens as expressed through the ballot box.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it very positive that there should be an improved uniform electoral procedure for the election of Members of the European Parliament. I would also stress issues which I believe to be essential, such as, for example, the proportional system which directly represents the opinion of the citizens and guarantees plurality; the fact also that parity is asked for – at the moment there are as many female voters as male ones, more even – and the political parties formed on the basis of the will of the citizens, and not only this Parliament, must also show that parity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and why not? – we should insist that the person who is elected, when the time comes, by the European Parliament as President of the Commission, should also be put to the people as a candidate to the European Parliament. So congratulations. You have my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry to have arrived late for this debate, but certain presidency obligations in relation to ministerial enlargement conferences have detained me until very recently. I do not wish to miss this opportunity to express the Spanish Presidency’s feelings about this achievement in relation to the European Parliament’s electoral procedure.

While this text originates from 1976, the reality is that the first initiative of this Parliament dates from 1960, and the road has therefore been a long and difficult one. However, it appears that a fruitful conclusion has been reached at last with this text.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency and the Council on the efforts they have made to bring together a consensus on what is constitutionally a very important agreement which will be decisive for the elections to the European Parliament scheduled for 2004, which furthermore will be the first elections in which the current candidate countries participate and we hope by then they will be full Members of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that this text contains the most important elements of the draft which Parliament adopted in 1998, with the excellent report by the former Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mr Anastasopoulos, and we are therefore delighted that what we have seen in the debate today will be adopted tomorrow by Parliament and – I hope – with the greatest possible majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the broader political issues mentioned during the debate will be discussed and dealt with by the Convention and perhaps that will be the best place to find a definitive solution to them.</p>
