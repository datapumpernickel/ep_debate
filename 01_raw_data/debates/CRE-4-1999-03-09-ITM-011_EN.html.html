This is for the following two reasons: firstly on a matter of substance, linked to the report"s content, and secondly on a procedural matter, linked to the way in which the report was drafted in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the substance, this reports contains a provision which can simply be called the cofinancing of agricultural expenditure. However, under the Treaty, agricultural expenditure is regarded as compulsory expenditure. For this reason, financing shared between the European Union budget and the national budgets cannot be permitted. A minority opinion from Mr Bourlanges sets out this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the report in question was not submitted for an opinion to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, although this committee is clearly responsible for expressing an opinion on an issue of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedural matter involves the fact that Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure has not been applied. This is because the principle of compromise amendments has been adopted, as so often happens in this committee, whereas the rapporteur should have presented a new report with a new deadline for the tabling of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the two reasons why, pursuant to Rule 128, I am moving the inadmissibility of this matter which I would ask to be put to the vote.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Haug </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite clear that this week we are waiting for important signals to be set in the European Union, even if that is precisely what Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy and a few other Members wanted to prevent. In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the financing of the Community needs to undergo radical reform. President Santer rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already taken important steps in regard to the interinstitutional agreement by laying down our principles, but financial reform will quite simply remain inadequate unless we also see changes on the revenue side. Interinstitutional agreement and reform of own resources are two sides of the same coin. The financing structure we have at present no longer matches up to the increased demands made on it. We need greater flexibility, transparency and autonomy in the European financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The present system relies too heavily on sources of finance that are calculated in a highly complicated manner and which, on top of that, virtually still take the form of Member State contributions. These shortcomings, together with the obvious imbalances in the distribution of the burden among the more prosperous Member States, need to be remedied. The Committee on Budgets therefore proposes a step‐by‐step readjustment of the own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted on this last night and basically reached the following conclusions. Firstly, European budgetary revenue must take a simpler and more transparent form and come under stricter democratic control. We want to replace VAT‐based own resources and GNP‐based own resources with a uniform, new, simplified source of own resources on a GNP basis. This measure will also help eliminate the imbalances between Member States in relation to funding the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in principle the European budget must be financed under the same conditions for all Member States. This means that existing correction mechanisms must be phased out and we must not add new correction mechanisms or even rebate systems. In concrete terms this means that the British rebate must have been phased out gradually by the time of the accession of the first new Member State at the latest. In its time, this rebate was granted to make up for the fact that the UK received too small a share of payments under the common agricultural policy. But at that time the agricultural proportion of the budget, accounting for over 70 %, was considerably higher than it is today. A rebate is anti‐systemic and in no way justifiable, even in relation to financing the Structural Funds or the costs of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would emphasise that reducing economic differences and achieving solidarity among the Member States are an important pillar of the Treaty and of European integration. But we cannot achieve this important aim on the expenditure side. Such an attempt would merely create rules that would make the budget complicated and less transparent. We have policies created specifically for the purpose of achieving solidarity among the Member States, such as structural policy. We want horizontal justice and vertical solidarity to be our principle for shaping the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, ever widening imbalances have emerged in the course of time in the financing of the budget. They now form a considerable obstacle to the development of the European Union. You can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council. To put it plainly: there will always be net contributors and net beneficiaries, nobody disputes that. But we must avoid excessive imbalances and unfair distributions of the burden. Otherwise there is a risk that our people will doubt the legitimacy of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that these imbalances can only be eliminated if the largest expenditure heading, agricultural policy, which accounts for almost 50 % of the budget, is not disregarded. It is all the more important to have rules that include agriculture because that is where many of these imbalances stem from. That is why it is sensible and reasonable for agricultural policy to be cofinanced in future, as the Committee on Budgets decided last night.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context let me also emphasise again that cofinancing does not mean renationalisation – on the contrary. In fact it involves the Member States more closely in framing Community policy, in qualitative terms too, and therefore leads to deeper integration. Nobody would even think of denying the Community nature of our structural policy. However, we do not want anyone to be overburdened as a result of this kind of measure, and I could imagine that when cofinancing is implemented, differentiated rules, which is to say lower cofinancing rates, could perhaps be found for economically weaker Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add that the considerable differences of opinion in the Council on this subject have naturally also had an impact on the discussions on our report, and have also had an impact on Parliament. Since there were heated disputes about the instrument of cofinancing, I submitted a compromise proposal to the Committee on Budgets. Accordingly, agricultural expenditure was to be reduced every year by a certain percentage and part of the resources thus obtained would go on structural aid measures in rural areas. This compromise did not obtain a majority, for which those who strongly rejected cofinancing bear particular responsibility. But since any solution that disregarded agricultural policy would have no substance and no prospects, we re‐submitted the original cofinancing proposal, which was then accepted, although not until after the compromise proposal had been rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">By correcting the unbalanced distribution of the burden we create the conditions for a viable budget for the future. To ensure that the European Union is financially independent, in the long term its financing should be based on new own revenue which does not take the form of Member State contributions. Primarily this revenue would consist of own taxes. As a first step towards this objective, a proportion of these taxes should accrue to the Union budget, on the basis of an agreement between the Member States on certain types of tax. Here we must emphasise, however, that this new own revenue should not be additional but should replace existing revenue, so as to avoid putting a further burden on the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, what we are trying to achieve is to adjust the financing of the Union to the requirements of the new quality of Communitisation. We have nearly achieved this new quality of Communitisation with the completion of economic and monetary union. The Member States" economies are interwoven in a particular manner. That means that the Member States" budgets and the European budget can no longer be looked at in isolation from one another. In the long term the stability of our common currency and the potential for growth of our closely linked economies depend on whether the European budget also becomes capable of taking economic action.</p>
<p class="contents">When we vote on this report we will also be deciding our own ability to act. Shall we sit and wait for Council decisions or are we capable of developing the power to shape policies by ourselves? If we adopt this report here on Thursday and make its demands the subject of negotiations with the Council on the new interinstitutional agreement, we will have made an important contribution to the reform of the European Union. Support us along this new road and let us dare to embark on it together.</p>

I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Institutional Affairs had two concerns on this issue. The first was to ensure that clarification was given on whether, in the future, own resources should be national contributions or resources collected in the form of taxes from economic operators. Although I must congratulate Mrs Haug"s report which has achieved some very important work, I do not share its conclusions and find its answer to this question to be rather paradoxical. This is because it initially suggests that national contributions should end and then it proposes extending the GNP national contribution and making this the main resource of the Union"s budget. Work that one out if you can!</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern of the Committee on Institutional Affairs was to clarify the status of cofinancing. Would this be a subsidy granted by the Member States on a voluntary basis to supply certain areas of Community expenditure? If so, this would involve a system which would call into question the unity of the common agricultural market and which would involve renationalisation and distortion of competition, as each country would subsidise its own agriculture at will. If, on the contrary, this involved compulsory cofinancing imposed on the Member States, this would be a new own resource, which is what justifies the project appearing in the Haug report. This new resource would be outside the legal framework of the Treaty as it would not comply with Article 201.</p>
<p class="contents">Either we have a system of own resources with unanimous agreement and ratification by the national parliaments or we forget this and work within Article 43, in which case this would be highly illegal. The main proposal of your report, Mrs Haug, is therefore contrary to the Treaty.</p>

If we take as a point of reference the contribution made by each individual in each Member State expressed as a percentage of his or her income, it emerges that the contribution made to the Union"s budget by people in certain countries with a lower standard of living is higher than the Community average in terms of a proportion of their income. On the other hand, if the same terms of reference are applied, say, to an Italian or to a British person, it is clear that their contributions are well below the average.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission"s communication puts forward three courses of action aimed at resolving the problem of budgetary imbalances. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Commission has been accused of partiality in formulating these proposals, as it only seems to defend the interests of certain net contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear that the Commission"s communication does not exhaust all possible solutions. One of the most ingenious, as far as fairness is concerned, involves compensating countries whose balance differs from what it should be as a function of their gross national product and relative per capita wealth. The combined negative balance would be financed by the remaining members, excluding the Member States benefiting from cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This option would allow cohesion to be preserved within the Union and would permit a fairer distribution of the financial effort required to maintain this level of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Though I commend the rapporteur for the work she has put into this report, I have to disagree with her. We should be advocating fairness – <span class="italic">equitas – </span> a principle which dates from the earliest days of Roman law.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wynn </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her report, not just because she is from our group but because she embarked on a Mission Impossible to try to get the agreement of the European Parliament on the future financing of the European Union. I am sure when we come to the vote you will see how impossible that position has proved to be. And yet the hard work she has put into it has made some progress towards a position that all the political groups can support.</p>
<p class="contents">Her original drafts resulted in 241 amendments. That shows there was more than a little interest. The fact that 241 amendments were tabled gave rise to some concern in the Committee on Budgets. The last thing we wanted to do was to come before Parliament with so many amendments to be voted on. So we asked the rapporteur to try to obtain as many compromise amendments as possible. And that is exactly what she did. She then put together a revised draft. And that is what the Socialist Group has tried to go along with. She has pleased just about every nationality except one, namely my own, in the way she has taken on the majority of interests. She has done very well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would not be telling the truth if I were to say that we were unanimous in our support for the final report we voted on last night in committee. If I were Greek or Irish, where the GDP of my country would be affected by Amendment No 141 which refers to the co‐financing of agriculture, I would not want to vote for that amendmen. Others believe that Amendment No 141 should be supported wholeheartedly as it would help reduce the net payments of their Member States and if I were German or Dutch, I would wholeheartedly support this new paragraph 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourteen out of the fifteen delegations within the Socialist Group want rid of the UK rebate and they will vote for those paragraphs which refer to it. If I were speaking for the British, I would make a valid case why the UK rebate is fair and justified but I am not speaking for the British and therefore I cannot say these things.</p>
<p class="contents">The one thing my group can agree on is that the status quo needs to be changed. It has not developed in any systematic way nor in accordance with any European strategy or real forward planning. Rather, it has developed as a reaction to events at given periods of time. I will give you a couple of examples. The original traditional own resources was the one truly European own resource. At the same time that one truly European own resource is waning rapidly in its importance. Yet, the good old traditional own resources are the cause of major headaches for control and concern about fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">And what about the VAT and GNP‐based own resources? As a member of the Committee on Budgets for almost ten years I would challenge any Member – except Mr Samland and Mr Colom I Naval – to explain the formula for VAT and GNP‐based own resources, that is to say how to calculate Member States contributions. Try to explain it to members of the general public and – even if you can do it – how are they to understand it? That is the situation that exists. We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency. All this Parliament wants is a clear and comprehensible system. We are somewhere near to getting an agreement on that through Mrs Haug's report. I would hope that at the end of the voting we have a clear and concise position and most of my group will be supporting it.</p>

<p class="contents">At the end of the morning sitting, the President put to an informal vote a change in the agenda for this afternoon in order to allow Sir Leon Brittan to attend. We have now reached Question Time and this change has caused a totally unacceptable imbalance between the political groups in this debate. The rapporteur, Mrs Haug from the Socialist Group, has just spoken for eight minutes followed by Mr Wynn from the Socialist Group for five minutes. This means that this debate on a report that is extremely important for European finances will now be suspended until the evening sitting, thereby preventing the other political groups from speaking before 9.00 p.m. For this reason I urge you to ensure that at least one speaker from each group is given the floor by encroaching into Question Time. Otherwise, the press who are listening in the press room will have heard thirteen minutes from one group – actually five but the rapporteur is from the same group – and nothing from the other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the importance of this report and of the vote on Thursday which will be closely followed, with three minority opinions and roll‐call votes, particularly with regard to agriculture, I would consider it deplorable if this House were to begin Question Time without at least one speaker per group having spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would ask you to consult our colleagues because I feel that the groups must be allowed to vote on this in the same way as you put to the vote the possible referral of the report back to committee due to the inadmissibility of the matter.</p>

But if you insist that we take a vote on the matter, then of course it can be done. However, I would prefer it if we could avoid that and let Question Time begin now. On the other hand, I think it is important that Mr Giansily has made our audience and the press aware of the imbalance which has arisen in that only members of one political group have had the floor.

Mrs Haug has now done an extremely comprehensive job on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, but I am sorry to have to say that the great number of amendments tabled in committee have not made the whole business any clearer or more convincing.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically I would like to point out that as long as the issue is confined to the fair distribution between the Member States of the own resources that have to be found, we will keep having to deal with conflicting financial and budgetary interests, to bemoan the lack of transparency and lack of ascribability of both revenue and expenditure. Only if the contribution of each individual taxpayer throughout Europe is taken seriously and evaluated could this dispute be brought to an end. That is why I particularly regret the rejection of the proposal from our Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commission provide information concerning the possibility of personalising the contributions that feed the own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">We should adhere to the principle of own resources, even if only traditional own resources – duties and agricultural levies – are genuine own resources, which in addition have been regressive for years. In addition, the Member States deduct these own resources as their contribution and ask for 10 % of them back for their customs administrations. One should at least check whether this 10 % can be appropriated for the customs administrations in the first place. At any rate, there is still quite a lot of circumvention and evasion in this area by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">VAT‐based own resources are tending increasingly to take the form of national contributions to the EU budget. Their share is being distorted because of the size of the black economy in some states.</p>
<p class="contents">GNP‐based own resources still correspond most closely to contributions. But I am sorry that the net‐contributor issue is not being resolved at all. I am in favour of cofinancing, I am in favour of the phased abolition of the British rebate and I am also in favour of examining the question of new own resources.</p>

She nearly had a mission impossible but we should make a distinction between some very controversial points and the general direction in which Parliament can express itself. It is essential for Parliament to indicate before the Berlin summit that it does not like the concept of <span class="italic">juste retour</span> , that it does not want to have further exemptions, that it wants to review the exemptions of the British rebate and that it does not want to go in the direction of a general correction mechanism. These are very fundamental points for the future. It is also important for the future for us to look at the prospect of having own resources of a real nature, although this may still take some time yet. In that respect it is a report of fundamental importance which we should welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously there are a number of points which cause difficulties. The issue of cofinancing will clearly be shared by a large majority of my group. I would take issue with Mr Bourlanges who says it is illegal. He said so in so many words. It is not illegal. It is the review of a policy which should remain <span class="italic">communautaire</span> . There is no question about that. The question is whether, in 1999, we should still have the same amount of finance in the Community budget for an agricultural policy which is in need of review. That element has nothing to do with legality. It is a question of appropriateness and of review.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way it is very important that the report very clearly says that we should find corrections on the expenditure side in the future. We know, for instance, that within the framework of the review the Spanish Government has put forward suggestions concerning asylum and immigration. It may be that the specific ways in which it is formulated need correction, but it is that kind of correction which will ultimately make, as Mrs Haug said, a Community of solidarity and a Community of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that general background the Liberal Group is very positive about her overall approach. There will certainly be individual items with which we may disagree. It is clear also that not everybody would be happy to phase out the UK rebate right away. We have heard that point before. But again, it is relevant to know that a large majority in Europe does not want to have any specific positions for any specific group of countries or individual countries. Indeed, as Mrs Haug rightly said, it should also be clear that by the time the first new batch of countries comes in, there should be an end to such special arrangements. That is a very positive point. It would be quite illogical if one Member State were not to cofinance enlargement of the European Union, which has nothing to do with the fact that in 1984 there was a specific situation concerning agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background it is also important that Mrs Haug makes it clear that we should have more democracy and a bigger say for Parliament in the future. Our colleague, Mr Colom i Naval will have considerable support for the issue of having more flexibility and transparency.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Giansily </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, thank you for having agreed to put our proposals to the vote. Clearly they were positively supported. In my opinion, this is because Mrs Haug"s report is extremely important for the future of this House and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This report boils down to just a few questions. Are the own resources that allow Community policies to be financed still sufficient? Do they guarantee the financial autonomy of the European Union? And finally, will they be sufficient to finance the future enlargement and to allow the Community to keep its commitments with regard to the common policies?</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that, although the rapporteur asked good questions, the Committee on Budgets provided poor answers in its vote yesterday. Firstly, Mrs Haug has instigated a real witch‐hunt against the common agricultural policy because, just by citing the share of agricultural expenditure in the Community budget, she has asserted that this is a main cause of the budgetary imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot support such an erroneous assumption. Although the share of agricultural expenditure in the budget has remained constant over the last twenty years in terms of GDP, it has nevertheless constantly fallen from year to year because the other policies have increased and also because a financial straitjacket has been imposed on this. Agricultural expenditure now represents less than 45 % of the total volume of EU expenditure whereas, when this House was elected for the first time in 1979, it represented over 90 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, having found that the CAP share of the budget is inappropriate, Mrs Haug proposes nothing less than cofinancing of agricultural expenditure by the Member States. Mr Bourlanges has just explained that this is totally unacceptable. This is due primarily to the special status of agricultural expenditure which, because of its effect on the economy and its support of the markets, cannot be lumped together with all the non‐compulsory expenditure and cannot be subject to the will of this House. Even partial cofinancing of the CAP from national budgets would inevitably lead to agricultural expenditure being renationalised and would lead the European Union down the dangerous road of reversing the integrated nature of the common policies. In this case, we cannot risk heading disastrously towards the disintegration of the common policies as, due to financial convenience and political opportunity, full financing would no longer be assured.</p>
<p class="contents">Any reform of Europe"s finances must consolidate Community solidarity, yet the options put forward by certain delegations continue to give cause for concern, particularly in terms of the Structural Funds. In my opinion, as recalled after the Brussels and Edinburgh European Councils of 1988 and 1992 respectively and the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the main priority in this issue is to respect the commitment made to the Member States which most need these funds, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In this respect I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Nikitas Kaklamanis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how can we fail to keep the commitments made previously when we are trying to integrate these states into the European Union and to ask for their full solidarity? The vote on Thursday will demonstrate that solidarity must be maintained between the Members of this House and between the European partners.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Miranda </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the first question to be asked about the European Union's own resources is whether they are sufficient for the policies that we intend to implement. What policies and at what level? Or, in other words, to use an expression we have often used, we must have the means to realise our ambitions. This is our vital starting‐point, especially now that we are heading towards a further and considerable enlargement due to bring into the European Union a large number of countries that, at best, have a level of development that is markedly below the current Community average.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions cannot be avoided. That is why, in our opinion, a clear answer will have to be found to the following questions: do we or do we not wish to continue with the current Community policies – and now is not the time for us to discuss what kind of policies they are – and do we or do we not want to prepare the ground for extending them in the future to the applicant countries? Furthermore, we must also consider whether there might not be other areas in which Community action is desirable and which would need resources to be allocated to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking, for example, of the fight against unemployment. What I have just said obviously clashes with the general direction taken in this discussion since, very often, the level of implementation in terms of revenue is confused with the level of implementation in terms of expenditure. Also, on a more fundamental level, there seems to be one overriding concern: to regard the current level of own resources as adequate and as a proper starting‐point and, in the light of the new developments – particularly preparations for enlargement – to settle for a fresh redistribution and allocation of those resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we do not go along with that approach, which is, in any case, out of keeping with all of the efforts made by the European Parliament on this subject for many years. We are the first to call for a root‐and‐branch reform of the CAP, but that does not mean that a properly reformed CAP will require less finances. We must, after all, ensure a fresh distribution of the available resources between producers and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we reject outright the proposal to renationalise CAP funding and the proposals to introduce a degressive approach. On the other hand, we feel that solidarity and cohesion must be at the forefront of the European Union's concerns, and we even believe that the current 1.27 % of GNP earmarked for those objectives will prove insufficient to guarantee effective redistribution in the future. In particular, we should make it crystal clear that there can be no enlargement with this level of own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there are other job‐creation projects which cannot be delayed, and they also call for additional funding. I would say that this is the central issue: how the European Union is to be properly financed. Therefore, in our opinion, and without wishing to go over the top, we think that this problem can only be solved if we improve the existing system of own resources, in particular by giving greater weight to GNP when calculating the transfers. We believe that this is the only sure way to achieve this objective.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that the question of cofinancing agricultural policy has nothing to do with the cheapest version of the net‐contributor debate that we keep hearing but that it is necessary in order to achieve what we have always called for: structural reform that will bring about more democracy in expenditure policy and that, above all, can make us capable of enlargement, for otherwise we would never manage to finance eastward enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, to describe this is as ‘the only communitised policy" is just a cliché to hide the fact that in this area, which accounts for nearly half the budget, there is no democratic control. When the ministers for agriculture meet and decide on their EUR 45 billion, neither the European Parliament nor any regional or national parliament has any say. That is the fundamental mistake in what is called the communitised agricultural policy. Support for environmental policy in rural areas, yes, as a structural policy, but support for a single sector, the agricultural sector, really is out of date in my view. It casts very serious doubt on the credibility of European policy‐making and is something that must also be discussed during the negotiations on a new financial framework. In that respect I warmly thank the Committee on Budgets for nailing its colours to the mast!</p>

I must say we are content that the question of national rebates has been abandoned: that notion – like all other such demands relating to sums totalling some 10 or 12 000 billion lire, a mere fraction of a Member State's overall budget – goes to the core of a topical debate which is gnawing away at European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the abandonment of this principle; however I do not welcome some of the attitudes struck in the report, particularly where we resuscitate an idea that has disappeared from the agenda of our governments and the Council of Ministers. We learned a few days ago that the German Government, which had been calling more loudly than any other for a new method of cofinancing the common agricultural policy, has withdrawn its proposal. To make Parliament, which unfortunately has a purely advisory role, return to the fray on this issue now strikes me as a mistake on the part of our committee yesterday. We shall vote in favour of the report, as long as it is somehow divested of all such inappropriate and blatantly controversial considerations. European integration does not depend on a few thousand million lire, but on creating true political union among the peoples of Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the characteristic feature of our four own resources is that they are inappropriate. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, their basis of assessment is fudged. This is true of both VAT and GNP. Secondly, they are not clear or transparent. Who among us can calculate the British rebate? Thirdly, these resources fortunately do not belong exclusively to Europe but are disguised contributions from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now intended to alter this system under pressure due to enlargement to the East and pressure from Germany. The European Commission has made a number of proposals. In fact, these own resources are serving to reveal the truth. The European Union cannot maintain its ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP and so we will ultimately end up with additional European taxes. Federalism will roll on implacably. Just as in the United States of America, Brazil, India and Australia, we will have to share income tax and corporation tax receipts between the nation‐states and Europe. Only one thing can protect us from this unfortunate fate and that is the rule of unanimity.</p>
