<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colino Salamanca </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I think we need to begin by acknowledging the significant amendments the European Commission is making to the 1994 proposal. The image of a wine sector that produces huge surpluses was all that remained of that proposal, a proposal we have fortunately moved on from today and which was geared exclusively to the wholesale grubbing‐up of vineyards.</p>
<p class="contents">The current reform, however – which is today clearly also the subject of discussion and controversy – focuses on improving the present balance between supply and demand and, above all, giving producers the opportunity to adapt to and take advantage of expanding markets.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should not be overly optimistic. In my opinion, the proposals put forward by the European Commission in relation to one of the issues being debated – new planting rights – seem more fitting than the Committee on Agriculture"s opinion. I also think that the Commission"s proposals are better able to provide this guarantee of dynamic equilibrium. What is more, it seems more positive to grant 1 % of the replanting rights in relation to the designated wine‐growing areas in zones where demand is increasing, than to extend the limit to 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementary measures in this regard might include permanent grubbing‐up measures for regions with structural surpluses and a revised regulation for replanting rights, which might extend beyond the 13 wine years after the year in which grubbing‐up took place.</p>
<p class="contents">The chapter on reconversion, which also focuses on aligning production to market demands, has been concluded positively, both in terms of recovering restructuring costs and including the possibility of financing specific measures to support wine making in regions which, because of drought, have difficult cultivation conditions. However, we completely disagree with the fact that Member States may continue to contribute up to 25 % of the cost for production regions located outside of Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards market mechanisms, we fully endorse the increase in the volume of alcohol in wine‐making installations to 15 % from 7 % through the vinification of grape musts. Similarly, we think that an important step has been taken as regards the use of specific distillation methods in potable alcohol which means that supplies to the Community sector will be guaranteed, a sector that annually demands almost 15 million hectolitres.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the event of a market disturbance, we should like to see the continued application of crisis legislation on a voluntary basis, in line with the Commission"s proposal in Article 30. In our opinion, it is vital that specific aid and measures for promoting wine consumption and providing consumers with information be included in a new title in the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of who has overall responsibility for these matters, the number of important decisions to be taken by the management committee as laid down in Article 74 and subsequent articles seems excessive. This is why we endorse measures aimed at restoring balance to the decision‐making procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must once again stress our opposition to the oenological practices used to increase levels of alcohol strength through the addition of saccharose. This immediately calls into question the definition of wine in Annex 1, where it is defined as the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or of fresh grape must.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cunha </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on having taken the initiative to present a proposal for reforming the common market organisation for wine. If we take a look at the world around us, we can see that Europe has lost its economic and commercial clout in this sector to new wine‐producing countries such as the United States, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and even New Zealand. These countries have enormously expanded their vineyards and have increased their production exponentially while, undoubtedly, improving the quality of their wines.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast with that expansionist policy, the Commission proposes that we in the European Union should continue with a policy of conditioning vineyards and vines over the next ten years. We have some fundamental criticisms of the Commission proposal: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ First, the 1 % increase in new planting rights is too low to develop the European Union"s vine and wine‐growing potential. The 3 % figure approved by the Agriculture Committee, which the European Parliament intends to propose, is much more realistic, although in my opinion it is still rather unambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Secondly, the vineyard restructuring scheme excludes older vines, which is unacceptable given the high average age of European vines. For example, in Portugal, my own country, 60 % of vines are at least 40 years old. Parliament also proposes to correct this error in the Commission proposal, with an explicit reference to the renewal of vineyards as one of the priorities of the restructuring schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Thirdly, the proposal is too rigid as regards sectoral and inter‐branch organisations. Subsidiarity should be strengthened on this score and the organisational traditions of the various Member States should be respected. Amendment No 171, second indent, should be rejected, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by congratulating Philippe‐Armand Martin on the compromise that he has managed to reach, on the basis of his skill and hard work, in negotiating a far better proposal than the Commission"s. However, I should like to emphasis that the new Article 42(a) inserted in the text is an affront to most producing countries, since it prevents the Member States from making the bottling of wines in their region of origin compulsory. It makes no sense to discuss this matter in relation to this regulation, since the Commission has presented a specific proposal on this, which is dealt with in Mrs Lulling's report. Amendment No 179 must therefore be rejected or else we will be guilty of a great injustice – nor, in my opinion, would we be playing by the rules. This must be analysed elsewhere. Apart from that, the Court of Justice has yet to take its final decision in this respect on the Rioja case, which is all the more reason for leaving any discussion of this matter until we debate the Lulling report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Querbes </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to Mr Martin"s report, we should welcome not only the important and high‐quality work produced by the rapporteur, but also the fact that the time devoted to preparing, discussing and organising this work enabled the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to provide Parliament with a good report which is comprehensive and coherent, and which was adopted by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be aware that such a result was only possible due to the close dialogue held with wine growers, and also because the basic ideas behind the report were inspired by the general report on the reform of the CAP which had already been adopted by Parliament. This also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The report therefore maintains a definition of the quality of wine, an agricultural and viticultural product, and in this way rejects all forms of industrialisation. It affirms Europe"s intention to increase its share of world production of quality wine, which is linked to human health when consumed in moderation. In order to achieve this, the report proposes controlling the expansion of vineyards, notably for the benefit of young farmers, and a more efficient measure for replanting and improvements to vineyard management techniques. Finally, all of this must be guaranteed by regulated management which includes promotion and adjustment instruments such as compulsory distillation, and which must not be left to the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the priority given within such a framework to enrichment by grape musts rather than by sugaring, the ban on the import of musts from third countries, which would be a Trojan horse for the quality of European production, the ban on blending white wine and red wine and, finally, the clear definition of the specific characteristics of each wine product; natural sweet wines, for example, are the only product capable of maintaining a level of human economic activity in certain areas of production of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone can see that the draft CAP reforms tend to become embedded in the rut defined by the Commission"s too liberal tendencies. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is very attentive to the demands of the experts and of society. This is why we will be approving the report which has been presented to us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lambraki </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, today the round of debates on the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 comes to an end. These debates have revealed how difficult it is to find a common denominator which will reconcile national interests which are divided by profound and increasingly visible differences.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the debate on wine‐growing will benefit the wine producer, the product and the consumer alike. Our rapporteur, Mr Martin, has contributed substantially towards this. If nothing else, wine has brought people together from time immemorial and has been an important element in social, cultural and religious life.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as an appreciation of the Commission proposal is concerned, it represents in principle a step forwards in tackling the problems faced by the sector. The complex regulatory framework which has thus far taken shape is an obstacle to attaining market equilibrium, developing productive capacity, improving the quality of wine and promoting products on the European and global market.</p>
<p class="contents">The current policy of grubbing up vines has resulted in a 20 % reduction in the area given over to vines in the EU, which is being inundated with wine from third countries, thanks to their aggressive production and marketing policy. In Greece, in particular, there has been a 35 % reduction, which is threatening the quality of Greek vineyards, as the abovementioned policy has primarily affected vineyards of local varieties of high quality but with a limited production capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, at least 3 % must be se aside for new planting rights in order to enable European vineyards to make the necessary quality adjustments, especially in the regions which have been damaged most by the grubbing‐up policy. As regards trade with third countries, we cannot accept a proposal which allows grape must to be imported from third countries for use in wine production.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to wine‐making practices and the possibility of increasing the alcoholic content of wine with sugar, we must maintain the status quo, the historical continuity of a product which is pre‐eminently traditional.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a word about the problems faced by island vineyards and vineyards in mountainous regions, especially in Greece, where production is dispersed over small‐scale vineyards in just such regions. The special soil and climatic conditions favour the production of high‐quality products, which the consumer wants, but production costs are high and constitute an inhibitory factor. The new COM must provide a special support structure for these crops.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Arias Cañete </span> <span class="bold">(PPE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mr Martin, not only on his excellent report, but also on his tireless efforts in the search for agreements and compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the Commission because, on this occasion, it has put forward a proposal which differs radically from the famous proposal it unfortunately put forward in 1994. This time, the proposal is better adapted to the current needs and concerns of the sector and therefore constitutes a valid starting point to allow Parliament and the Council to reach important agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to concentrate here on three of the fundamental issues approved by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First, safeguard clauses have been included in the recitals, articles and provisions on repeal which, in spite of the repeal of more than 23 Council regulations, are aimed at guaranteeing future respect for the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the area of quality wines produced in specific regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, with regard to the distillation of table wines to obtain alcohol for potable uses, I should like to thank the rapporteur for having accepted our amendments and for having included them in the final version. This has meant that the aid set for table wines to be distilled for potable uses will definitely not be set at the Commission"s discretion. Instead, the Commission will have to set the aid in proportion to the needs to supply potable alcohol to those sectors which, according to the rules, are obliged to use it. Brandy and liqueur wine production will be safeguarded as a consequence, and the production of more than 300 000 hectares of vines and thousands of jobs in vineyards, wine‐cellars, related industries andancillary services will be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial for this aid to be set at a level which guarantees the competitiveness of by‐products of wine for potable uses. If both the by‐products of wine and the aid given for these products were to disappear, the cost of the by‐products used to make brandy would increase by 300 %, whereas alcoholic products made from molasses and cereals would remain stable. This would increase the current price differences in alcoholic wine products and force drinks that have to use the by‐products of wine off the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Parliament has improved the Commission"s proposal by setting out the ways in which the aid given will be annually reviewed and precisely how primary and secondary aid will be monitored. And, as in previous amendments that I tabled in the House, I believe that this will guarantee the prices of potable alcohol as well as an annual minimum distillation volume of 15 million hectolitres.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I welcome the Committee on Agriculture"s decision to accept separate technical definitions for fortified wine and fortified liqueur wine in Annex 1. The particular production methods and organoleptic characteristics of these types of wine mean that they are differentiated and distinct, and, as such, merit a separate definition.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a reform offers a welcome opportunity to set out an independent and distinct definition of these fortified wines, which were not and are not the same as the liqueur wines mentioned in the original 1970 COM in wine. And, in terms of geographical appellation, surface area of the vineyard, wine producing and wine making, trade and job creation, they mean far more than other products that are defined separately in the basic regulation of the original COM.</p>

The Council and Commission forget that there are Community wines of a very special quality, which can enrich the quality of Community wines in a most wonderful and natural way. It is not necessary to import such wines from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">They also forget the relentless way in which the vineyards have been targeted over many years. Tens of thousands of hectares of vines have been grubbed up, at a rate which has been very detrimental to Greece. This tragic situation is very difficult to reconcile with the approach you are taking today, unless of course there are ulterior motives and dubious interests at work.</p>
<p class="contents">You are promoting a moratorium on planting and you want to restrict wine growing, push it to the brink and perhaps even create a shortfall to justify opening the floodgates to imports to serve the interests of the WTO and GATT, thereby obtaining compensation in other sectors which interest you. You are allowing sugar to be added to Community wines, especially to German wines, in order to increase the alcohol content. This is inconsistent with the restriction on production and the quality that you are after. If you wish to favour Germany, then at least have the sugar content written on the product.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, this proposal upgrades the institution of the inter‐branch organisations and aims to force the poor wine grower to compete on the same terms as the ruthless industrial processors of this precious commodity. You are sacrificing this product, Commissioner, and you are sacrificing it to illicit, questionable interests. You forget that it is not simply a product, it is a popular form of sustenance, and it provides excellent employment. Wine is civilisation, it is tradition and culture. Do not forget that. There are countries in which, since the time of Homer, people have been brought up with this culture of wine. And you are sacrificing it on the altar of questionable multinational interests.</p>

Nonetheless, I am not one of those satisfied with the end result, and I therefore did not vote in favour in the Committee on Agriculture. I think more can be done, and will therefore discuss two aspects in particular that I believe to be gaps about which I am dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the reinclusion of compulsory distillation, which had actually been removed from the Commission proposal. This proposal is contradictory: we cannot demand, on the basis of the market equilibrium that has now been achieved, to be allowed to launch a policy of replanting and renewing vines, while once again proposing compulsory distillation. I think this is a contradiction that has to be resolved by the vote in plenary, and our action – as I suggested earlier in the 1997 price package – must be based primarily on a policy of replanting or intelligent grubbing‐up, managed on a regional basis within the European Union. I believe this is the policy that must be pushed forward, combined with the flexible, adaptable and creative approach that other honourable Members have already mentioned. I believe this is a problem that must be remedied. At any rate, all we Italian Members will be working for that, not least in the vote in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns our conception of quality. Many Members in this House have spoken about quality and the need to protect the agricultural origin of the wine and the product itself; however, no effort has been made to work towards harmonisation, not even of production and vinification methods. I recognise that it is difficult to ban the addition of sucrose, but all the same, something could be done to improve quality: measures could be taken regarding the level of minimum must content or labelling, or we could leave things as they are but find a way of rewarding those countries with the best record on this. But nothing significant has been done here. And that is why – without wishing to start a revolution – we shall again be raising the issue of quality rather more seriously and consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is worth pointing out that we are discussing a sector that has been penalised in terms of resources; it is accorded half of what it contributes to European agriculture's GDP. More must be done to promote the product on the international markets.</p>

These changes are mostly positive ones and take account of the amendments that we tabled and adopted in the Agriculture Committee. They include the possibility of renewing vineyards and aid for promoting consumption in the internal and external markets, and banning products made from musts originating in third countries or prohibiting imports of such musts for vinification. Lastly, I would like to refer to our acceptance of crisis distillation and the introduction of certain aids, albeit insufficient, for producer organisations and vines planted in less‐favoured areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot go on allowing wine, a Mediterranean product accounting for around 7 % of the Community"s agricultural production, to be funded by only 2.5 % of the agriculture budget, whilst arable crops, which chiefly concern the countries of central and northern parts of the EU, receive 43 % of that budget, although they account for less than 15 % of Community agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just one more example of the clear discrimination that will still exist between different crops after this reform. We also think it is unacceptable for products resulting from processes such as sugaring to raise alcohol content to be called wine. We are therefore tabling certain amendments, which we hope will be approved, making it compulsory to include this on the labels of such products, to inform and protect consumers, and also to set a five‐year deadline for ending once and for all the practice of adding sugar to wine.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fantuzzi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, for at least seven or eight years now, we have been discussing wine and the now notorious reform of the wine sector. As you will be aware, Commissioner, back in 1993‐1994 for instance, proposals were tabled on which I had the honour to act as rapporteur in the House, in 1995. So this particular wine has been tasted at some length. That shows both how complex and controversial reform of the sector is, but it also demonstrates that clouds do sometimes have a silver lining. And that is fortunate, because the failure to implement the old 1994 concept of reform has been a blessing for European wine‐producers. That reform was finally shelved, and what we have on the table today, as previous speakers have rightly pointed out, are other ideas which are certainly an improvement on the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the fundamental approach taken previously was flawed. I recall that your predecessor, Commissioner Steichen, predicted that come the year 2000 there would be a 40 million hectolitre wine surplus; that was used to justify adopting drastic and extremely punishing measures, inspired by the pessimism of the bureaucrats, which would have been highly damaging to Europe's wine growers. In point of fact, there have been no surpluses for some years now, and that change of fortune is, I believe, not the work of Bacchus but a result of the extensive grubbing‐up and the ban on replanting during that period which substantially impoverished European vineyards and left us with ageing vine stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has therefore lost ground in an art in which it has been and remains the world leader. Of course, that has caused some alarm bells to ring. Competition from new European producers is beginning to have a significant impact within Europe too. In the space of a few years, imports of wine from outside Europe have doubled. There are countries where costs are far lower than they are here, countries that enjoy far greater freedom of movement and which are not restricted by the bureaucratic obstacles and red tape that have always plagued European wine growers. And so this new and sensible approach is welcome; I acknowledge that, Commissioner Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">With this new proposal, the Commission is I think taking a fresh approach based on the premiss that we now need to help a sector which has in recent years achieved market equilibrium, and must therefore avoid adopting measures that could destroy it. In my view, the best remedy is a good dose of liberalisation. I realise that, coming from a Socialist, that may sound surprising, but the wine sector in particular shows that excessive regulation can also be fatal. And so we need to take a more dynamic approach to Europe's vineyards: there has to be advance replanting, extensive restructuring of vineyards and higher allocations than currently provided for in the Commission proposal. Indeed, I share the view expressed by previous speakers that more must be done to restore balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an agricultural policy under which products continue to be protected by applying two different sets of criteria, a policy under which there is a huge gulf between the support given to products from central and northern Europe and the support given to Mediterranean products. I think that the rapporteur has done a good job, but not good enough: the report is sound on a number of controversial issues, such as the import of musts, the powers of the Commission and the efforts made to make Europe's vineyards more dynamic. On two points, however, which have already been mentioned by Mr Filippi, we are unable to agree with Commissioner Fischler, principally the questions of compulsory distillation and the addition of sucrose. I do not agree with the point concerning compulsory distillation, because the Commission has proposed optional crisis distillation which I consider to be the right response to the new market dynamic. As far as the addition of sucrose is concerned, I am well aware of the fact that anyone tackling this problem runs enormous risks, in particular the risk of blocking all the rest of the reform. Nonetheless, it would have been worth taking account of the existing differences and inequities and sending out the message, which we are always calling for, that European producers must enjoy equal worth and show solidarity. We are always talking about quality; well, I believe that quality also means giving priority to products wholly derived from the vine.</p>

After the abortive proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market in Wine in 1994, and following our proposed amendments in 1995, the Commission has certainly taken its time in submitting a new proposal for reform. However, it has now adopted a more positive approach, and it is indeed inconceivable that we should think of meddling with Europe's wine‐growing potential, with all its tradition and its wonderful variety, and simply abandon the European internal market and the world market to competition from third countries, whatever the World Trade Organisation may say.</p>
<p class="contents">The human race would be healthier if far more people could afford to drink one, two or even three glasses of wine every day. The way to meet such a level of demand is not compulsory distillation or grubbing‐up, but a far higher production levelof quality wines, especially in the Community, and of course far lower excise duties than those currently levied in many Member States, particularly in the north of the EU. Having said that, I am delighted that, thanks to the enormous amount of work put in by our rapporteur, Mr Martin, whom I would like to thank very sincerely, the Agriculture Committee has managed to make some real improvements to the Commission proposal. This has involved some sensible compromises, and to achieve these compromises we have all had to mix a little water with our wine.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that despite all these efforts some of our colleagues from the south have again gone on the war‐path against the centuries‐old wine‐growing practices in the north of the Community. And the strange idea some people have that wine growers not using enrichment should be given additional planting rights is simply crazy. I personally can agree to the compromise, which took so much hard work to achieve. I can live with it, especially because overall it represents a positive approach to maintaining and increasing marketable wine production, which after all makes a magnificent contribution to preserving our wonderful landscape, not least in my own country. But the Agriculture Committee's proposals are also well‐balanced and sensible when it comes to wine‐growing practices, new planting rights and flexible measures in the event of poor weather conditions or unusually abundant grape harvests, where maximum yields are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission, and Mr Fischler in particular, to adopt our proposals for the additional chapter on special aid and support measures for wine products and for the involvement of trade organisations in this. I would be pleased if he could confirm this today. The proposals also include initiatives to promote moderate wine consumption and advertising campaigns outside the Community. That is the right way to go. I hope that the Commission and the Council of Ministers will support us in this, and that a substantial majority of this House will vote for it, as a large majority for this sensible compromise is our best chance of making our voice heard in the Council of Ministers.</p>

Secondly, they are suffering massive discrimination. Statistics given by the Commissioner show that, in 1994, a dairy company received an average of ECU 13 140 million from the EAGGF, a combined meat and dairy company received ECU 11 536, arable farmers received ECU 11 207, while a wine‐producing company received, on average, ECU 4 590. The figures speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about what is happening, and I wish to highlight the following important points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, sugar is used for making cakes and pastries, not wine. Existing regulations and their planned extension will, in my opinion, undermine the essence of the European Union wine‐producing proposal and position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, do we not want to improve the quality of our wines? We have must within the Community, which is of excellent quality, and we do not need to turn to imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, to alleviate the shock caused by grubbing‐up, there must be an increase in planting, which can start with the 3 % which is being debated.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we believe that distillation is not something we can impose willy‐nilly on the producers. They produce wine. If they want to carry out distillation, this should be left up to them, as it is now, and we should not legislate to make distillation compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I think that special measures are needed for vineyards in mountainous and island regions.</p>

Insisting on bottling at source is a well‐meaning and naive attempt to protect jobs and the reputation of the wines from particular wine‐growing regions. Unfortunately, with respect, it shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to. Nor does it recognise the changing way in which wine is distributed, marketed or consumed, especially in northern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On arrival the wines are specially packed to meet the needs of the particular markets. They are canned or boxed with the supermarkets' own labels or they are placed in specialist chilled containers for the restaurant and pub market for easy sale by the glass. I am assured that bulk imports in the UK are carefully protected by making sure that the right label goes on the right wine. They do not put the word ‘Bordeaux" on a bottle of wine or a can of wine that has come from a third country. They make certain that their computerised systems respect quality. The bottlers have an interest in ensuring that they are seen to be selling quality wines.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that we need to ensure that these control systems are transparent and obvious to all. Perhaps this is something we can discuss in detail during the passage of Mrs Lulling's report at some point in the future. But, please, do not let us risk job losses in our own wine areas and possibly creating problems for our own bottlers by creating barriers between producers, distributors and consumers which are artificial and will damage trade within the Union.</p>

However, it must be pointed out that this is due to Europe"s dominant international position: Europe"s share of the production in this sector is 60 % and, moreover, 80 % of this is exported. So, you may ask, why have a market organisation? Well, quite simply because the economy is increasingly becoming a global one, and we have to adopt Community rules in order to organise ourselves properly in view of this globalisation. That is why I consider it useful to emphasise certain aspects of the report which are of major importance to wine growing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the planting of vines, we have made great efforts over the past ten years to reduce the areas under vines. From now on, if we need to know how to grub up vines in certain fragile zones, we should also know how to replant them taking into account the requirements and demand for quality. This is why we must show flexibility and allow expanding regions to meet demand by replanting vines, while reducing surpluses in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As for oenological practices, I am very concerned by what I have just heard. As a Frenchman in the heart of Europe, I would say this to you: let us put an end to this war waged by the Gauls in southern Europe against those in northern Europe, and let us respect the traditions inherited from our ancestors which are accepted and effective. We are fighting amongst ourselves, and our attitudes are equally rigid.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the wine industry, it is clear that it is the close cooperation between production and trade that has established satisfactory trade patterns for both the consumer and the quality of the wine appreciated by him. This is why we need to respect the organisations set up in our regions and, above all, the crucial role they play in adapting resources to requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as exports are concerned, let us know how to open up our markets to the outside world and provide the means to promote communications on product quality in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is in this spirit and on the basis of a Commission proposal which seemed to us overcautious and, at times, Malthusian and too bureaucratic, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has examined the report on the COM in wine. Numerous meetings and discussions have enabled us to arrive at the compromise reflected in the text which has been presented to you. Ladies and gentlemen from both North and South, we must vote in favour of this report. It represents significant progress in comparison with the 1994 proposal, and it should ensure that our opinion is taken into account by the Council. At any rate, I sincerely hope this is the case.</p>

We now find ourselves faced with the difficult task of trying to regulate this diversity within a Common Market Organisation, and to regulate it in such a way that this diversity is preserved. We do not want a uniform European wine, but we do want a legal framework that is workable.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from one of Europe's northern wine‐growing areas, from the Mosel region. Our wines grow in different climatic conditions, which makes them different, but they have their connoisseurs, and there is certainly a market for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission and our rapporteur Mr Martin, and also the Agriculture Committee, for making it possible to reach a compromise on this common organisation for wine, which, in recognition of the specific characteristics of individual regions, provides for traditional wine‐growing practices to be maintained. This means the wine from Europe's regions that we know and appreciate will be preserved. Jobs in upstream and downstream sectors will also be preserved, as will our agricultural landscapes. You can regulate the market, but you cannot regulate nature, the weather and the harvest.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of setting a quantity of wine that can be marketed in any given year. Our wine‐growing regions have already set corresponding maximum yields per hectare. But I am vehemently opposed to the Commission's proposal that if the yield per hectare is exceeded by 120 % the entire harvest would lose the right to be designated as quality wine. Up to now, quality wine has not been regulated in this way. Every farmer and every wine grower is dependent on the weather, and good years are needed to compensate for bad ones. Wine from years when there was a good harvest can be marketed during years with poorer yields, as a way of ensuring the income of family businesses. So we should allow carry‐over. I would particularly ask you to consider this point again.</p>

This issue is still pending from the 1992 CAP reform and the Commission"s proposal is of vital importance for the present and, above all, the future of this sector, especially given the crossroads European wine making has reached. We need the instruments to enable us to be competitive in today"s open market and to enable the European Union to maintain its position as world leader in this sector, a sector which has an enormous added value in both social and economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The consensus reached clearly respects the specific traditional qualities and the various oenological practices that exist and also lays great emphasis on quality and promotion both inside and outside the European Union. What is more, it enables European wine making to enjoy moderate and controlled growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards alcohol and other related issues, I shall try not to repeat everything that has already been said, but I should like to stress the need to strike a balance between the technical progress made and the need to preserve the specific characteristics of European wine. This is something else that the reform must resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, demand for European wine in an increasingly open market would increase if it were more competitive, and if such competitiveness was not solely confined to vineyards but also extended to include improved installations, as was mentioned, and wine promotion that is linked to the dissemination of the results of scientific research on wine. We are also in favour of the creation of a standing committee for wine exports, as we believe this is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is, however, one other issue which concerns me, namely, wine making which purports to be European but which uses grape musts that have been imported from third countries. Can you comment on this?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Commissioner, you have a golden opportunity to adopt the amendments approved by the House and, in particular, the consensus reached here which we have worked hard to achieve. Indeed, we must admit that some have worked harder than others. Nonetheless, I believe that this would be in the interests of European wine making for you to adopt these amendments.</p>

Well, we have drained this particular bottle and, as often happens, we are left with the lees that could have clouded the wine. Thank goodness I am, as I said, the last speaker: yes indeed, because I think that the Commission proposal is a sound one, I think the rapporteur has shown admirable zeal – taking the diplomatic rather than the technical approach – and yet, for me, the reform and the outcome of this work are something of a hollow victory.</p>
<p class="contents">In politics, there is a tendency to evaluate any given issue depending on whether you come to it from the Left or the Right. When we discuss agriculture, we inevitably return, Mrs Lulling, to the old way of looking at a problem as perceived from the North or the South. Despite the best of intentions, that gap has yet to be bridged; in fact the gulf is still very wide. This could have been an opportunity for trying to reach across it but, for reasons that other Italian colleagues have already explained, we cannot be optimistic about the chances of what I would venture – a little exaggeratedly perhaps – to describe as an almost epoch‐making recovery from an age‐old handicap, and it will be a few years yet before there is any possibility of even a partial recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not wish to cloud the issue of the wine at all. There are some positive aspects, and I would like to mention one or two of them. First we have the move towards quality and the promotion of wine as a drink that is completely harmless and digestible, suitable for all ages and all tables; then there is the aid for vineyard restructuring, replacing table wines with quality wines; in addition, we have aid for young producers and for disadvantaged mountain regions. Those elements with which I cannot agree are, however, the dearth of protection against wine from third countries, and the excessive focus on the technical aspects of cultivation and bottling, with less attention paid to the aspects of production. Unsatisfactory also is the drive towards replacing saccharose with concentrated and rectified must, with all the necessary incentives, for reasons already explained by other colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to compulsory distillation: I have to wag my finger at my old friend Mr Martin here. It was an excellent idea on the part of the Commissioner and the Commission to get rid of compulsory distillation and keep only crisis distillation. For reasons that I have yet to understand, our friend Mr Martin has sought to reinstate it. It is up to you to redress the balance, Commissioner!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you all for the work you have put into examining the Commission proposal on the market in wine. And I would especially like to thank Mr Martin as rapporteur for his analysis of the proposal, and above all – and this has already been acknowledged by several speakers – for his efforts to achieve a compromise. By virtue of all these efforts we have been able to ensure that the proposal for the wine sector will not slip behind the other Agenda 2000 reform proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this proposal is intended to replace 23 existing Council regulations, to achieve simplification and to cover all basic areas, from the vine to the labelled product. Although the final list of amendments is rather long, I am still pleased to see that there are many important subjects on which we are at one. In particular, we are in agreement that quality is essential to maintain and improve the competitiveness of Community wine, and that the conversion measures planned should play an important part in achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also agreed that the market position requires more flexible administration of production potential. There is also agreement that we must preserve the specific character of all Community wines and provide a legal basis for this by means of regulations on traditional winemaking methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I respond to your amendments in more detail, allow me to remind you once again of the seven objectives of the Commission's reform proposal. First, we want to make the wine sector more competitive. Second, we want to maintain the improved balance between supply and demand. Third, we want to eliminate the availability of intervention as an artificial outlet for surplus production. Fourth, we want to continue to maintain all traditional outlets for potable alcohol and other products. Fifth, we want to accommodate regional diversity. Sixth, we want to strengthen the role of producer organisations and inter‐branch organisations. And, seventh, we want to considerably simplify the legislative framework and make it more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a large degree of agreement on these objectives. Some of your amendments suggest improvements in the measures we have proposed in order to realise these objectives. In particular, we consider the new wording of the provisions on the creation of a legal framework for producer organisations and inter‐branch organisations to be a very constructive proposal. I hope that will answer Mrs Lulling's question. We have already started to discuss this.</p>
<p class="contents">Other helpful amendments are those on the introduction of criteria for triggering crisis distillation, new rules for liqueur wines and a whole series of technical improvements. However, there are also areas where we differ and I would like to discuss those in rather more detail today. In order to give areas where production cannot keep pace with demand an opportunity for some limited expansion, the Commission is proposing an allocation of newly created planting rights totalling some 35 000 hectares. Spread over a period of three years, this is nearly twice as much as the additional rights granted under the last two agriculture price packages.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal that producers undertaking to grub up areas under vines will simultaneously be granted replanting rights will also lead to a considerable expansion in production potential. This expansion could even be substantially greater than the 35 000 hectares which we are to achieve with the additional percentage. So I cannot see any scope for us to go any further, as we would otherwise jeopardise the objective of balancing supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">In one amendment, there is a call for the inclusion of pure and simple renewal of vineyards in the restructuring measures. I would like to remind you that the restructuring measures are intended to help to adjust production in certain problem areas to changes in market demand. Of course we only have limited means at our disposal and we cannot therefore afford to finance measures which up to now have always been part of normal vineyard management.</p>
<p class="contents">Again on restructuring measures, you have suggested that restructuring costs outside Objective 1 areas should be cofinanced by up to 25 % by Member States. I recognise that cofinancing is still under discussion, but a final decision on that will have to be taken as part of the Agenda 2000 package. This therefore needs to be dealt with separately from the common organisation for wine, as part of the overall financing of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain other amendments raised doubts about the status quo as regards enrichment, especially enrichment by sugaring. I have to agree with Mr Bébéar in this case: I think it is 150 years too late for us to start thinking about waging a new war between the southern and northern states. So I believe that we are right in sticking to the various traditional enrichment methods or oenological practices.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments concerning the proposed crisis distillation measure, I am firmly convinced that the Commission's approach is the right one. Compulsory measures are inappropriate in the more open market which has prevailed since the Uruguay Round, in which minimum prices can no longer be set, as the withdrawal of quantities of wine would simply result in making room for additional imports. However, I can accept your proposal to incorporate additional criteria for triggering the measure in the Council text, particularly those on market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment calls for the common market organisation to include measures for internal and external sales promotion. I would like to be clear about this: I think that external sales promotion would be more effective in a horizontal regulation. But I am of course in favour of external sales promotion measures. However, I think that the various views of the Member States on the promotion of sales in the internal market and the overall stance of the Member States on the sale or promotion of sales of alcoholic drinks would make it difficult to include this in the common organisation of the market in wine.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to lifting the current ban on producing wine from must originating from third countries – a subject several Members touched upon – I am conscious how strongly some Member States feel about this provision. We have taken detailed advice from various experts, and have received clear legal opinions indicating that our WTO obligations quite simply require us to lift the present general ban. The Commission has nevertheless explained to the Member States that our proposal will very probably include provisions on controls and labelling, including a scheme for depositing an import security, in order to guarantee that wine made from third country must cannot be regarded as Community wine.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a number of amendments have been tabled about quality wines produced in specified regions. I would like to make it clear that we intend to adopt the provisions of the current Council regulations in their entirety. Nevertheless, we want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations. With regard to maximum yields of quality wine, the Commission has already taken this opportunity to draw up a common scheme for cases where a maximum yield is exceeded, so that uniform conditions are guaranteed for Community producers of quality wine.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as Member States can settle this question efficiently themselves by means of transparent provisions at national level, then we could revisit this proposal and thus take account of Mrs Klaß's concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to discuss an amendment affecting various parts of the proposal. This calls for various Council decisions affecting market organisation to be subject to Parliament's opinion. Although I regard this as an excellent decision‐making procedure for major changes and above all changes of policy, it is simply too slow and cumbersome for purely technical market organisation measures, where decisions are needed so that we can react promptly to the market situation. It is precisely for that reason that we have made a conscious decision to cover basic principles in a Council regulation, whilst decisions on market organisation are to be made at Commission level. This is intended to maximise flexibility and ensure a rapid response. I cannot therefore accept any amendments that would jeopardise this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my comments have made the Commission's position on the amendments included in the report sufficiently clear. In conclusion, I would like to stress once again the large measure of agreement which is apparent on many important questions.</p>

I clearly stated that the present GATT rules do not allow us to keep a ban on imports of must. If we are to comply with GATT, we have to change this. However, what we very probably can do is to ensure that imported must, even if it is mixed with musts produced in the Community, is adequately labelled so that anyone can see that the wine in question has been produced from imported musts.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is a question of ensuring that consumers can see that a wine containing imported must is indeed a wine that is either partly or entirely produced from imported must. But we cannot simply ban imports of must.</p>
