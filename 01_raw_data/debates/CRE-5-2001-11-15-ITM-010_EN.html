This is not the case in an increasing number of countries in the world, and that is an extremely worrying trend. Unfortunately, Nigeria is an alarming case in point. Precious little is left of the hopes which the democratically elected president had raised as successor of the corrupt military regime. Ethnic and religious feuds are now the order of the day across the country. Not a month goes by without blood being shed. The number of casualties is running into the hundreds and the situation is getting worse, not better. In that light, the balance sheet for October is shocking. There was fighting between Muslims and Christians in Jos and disturbances in Kano where, moreover, there has been a cholera outbreak. The government army carried out ethnic atrocities and massacres in the Middle Belt. The government itself was shrouded in silence. Only after two weeks did President Obasanjo announce that a special committee would investigate the murders. The billion-dollar question is whether the president is actually up to the task of running this country which is extremely difficult to govern. Apparently, his position is not strong enough in order to keep the country united and allow the different nations to live together peacefully. It is frightening. Just now when we are nearly free of the Taliban, we are lumbered with regions such as the north of Nigeria, where the shari’ah is introduced. Autonomy for those regions should not go as far as observing their own rules that are diametrically opposed to national legislation and that suppress the population and women, in particular. To sentence a pregnant woman to capital punishment for having intercourse before marriage is barbaric. My question to the Commission is: What can the European Union do? In any event, the dialogue with Nigeria will need to be intensified. However, Europe’s hands are tied if the president and the government themselves lack the courage to act and to do everything in their power to allow the Nigerians to live together in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, veteran President Olusugun Obasanjo is increasingly facing the difficult challenge of keeping riots under control between northern Muslims and Christian southerners, not infrequently culminating in gruesome blood baths.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we were recently alarmed once again by a dubious military reprisal in the federal state of Benue. I notice with some discomposure that the army seems to be taking the law into its own hands in various cases. It is understandable that the Tivs, associated with the South, are very suspicious of the fact that the army was siding with the northern-oriented Jukuns, the population group to which the current Defence Minister belongs. It is of the utmost importance for the military forces to act within the constitutional mandate and ensure the safety of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing tension in the Middle Belt has at the same time illustrated my growing concern for the ever-widening chasm between religions that is fanning out towards the middle and south of the country. In a personal meeting with his American opposite number, President Bush less than two weeks ago, President Obasanja reassured President Bush once again of his support for the International Coalition against terrorism. On that same fateful Friday, 2 November, however, as the representative of the thirteenth federal state incorporating Islamic penal law, he was also faced with implementing the decree in Kaduna to introduce Islamic penal law, the shari'ah. This will do nothing to promote the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and the large Christian minority in that state.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my emphatic support for the attempts by the Nigerian President and parliament to look into, and tackle, the causes of the continuing ethnic and religious conflicts, to which, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, Paragraph 4 of the resolution refers. I would ask the Council and Commission to contribute according to their means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were also aware of the simmering tension in the country, particularly in the north, with outbreaks of violence. Sharia law has been a potent symbol of the cause of that tension, demanded by some Muslims, feared by most Christians and other faiths; partly the result of northern Nigeria not benefiting from independence and oil as the south has done, and a resentment of corruption that they see as chronic in the country. Thousands have died as a result of violence, especially in Kaduna and many Christian homes, churches and businesses have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Zanfara state government has given local vigilante groups the power to implement Sharia law. In reply seventeen southern states have demanded the right to set up their own police forces. Northerners are leaving Lagos after riots that have led to deaths. In the north, journalists in Kano are threatened with Sharia law if they represent it in a negative way.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we see in Benue and Taraba in east and central Nigeria tribal, not religious, wars. The Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries, not about religion. Nineteen soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered. Then we saw the awful reprisals in which Zakibian, a town of 20 000 people, was destroyed and over 200 people killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we welcome President Obasanjo's announcement of an inquiry. Ethnic and religious violence must be stopped in Nigeria. There must be equality before the law and not fear and violence. Corruption from whatever source must be rooted out. The European Union must support this. It must also provide humanitarian support for Nigeria, where over 200 people have died of cholera in the last few weeks, and help the people who have been displaced as a result of this violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union should not, however, be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa. At the beginning of this year, the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo, declared that 2001 would be the year in which the Nigerian people would reap the rewards of the transition to democracy. We supported this statement when we met at that time in Abuja in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The trust has, however, suddenly turned to deep concern. A split in the ruling party in Nigeria, the absence of economic improvements and the persistence of poor living conditions have made people increasingly willing to resort to violence, thus creating a breeding ground for political extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">To keep them in check, President Obasanjo felt it necessary to deploy soldiers in seven Nigerian states. Since then more than 3 000 people are said to have been killed and there is renewed fear that the military might return to power. The introduction and application of Sharia law in an increasing number of states has heightened religious and ethnic tensions. Violent criminals often go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The President and all of the forces of democracy in Nigeria are called upon to take determined action against violent criminals using the legal means at their disposal, to secure respect for universal human rights and to hurry through economic reforms which will benefit all parts of the country, if there is to be an end to this misery.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to monitor this process actively and to do everything within its power to ensure that this trouble spot in Africa once again becomes a place of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nigeria is proof, Mr President, that the wealth and value of a nation are often measured according to the priority that it gives to human rights, and especially to women, children and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which means that it has vast human resources. It also has mineral resources and a high oil production that should protect its population from poverty. Furthermore, its huge diversity could provide real dynamism. And yet, for decades, a climate of violence towards democrats has been allowed to flourish there and Nigeria’s rulers have never truly sought to punish the extra-judicial murders and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">By not taking any preventive action, the military powers have allowed a climate of latent ethnic conflict to evolve and one of these conflicts, in the East of the country, pitting the Tivs and the Jukuns against one another, has just led to the deaths of 200 civilians, who were massacred by soldiers. The most shocking aspect, Mr President, Commissioner, is that the State authorities are trying to play down this event by explaining that the soldiers involved in the massacre were reacting to the murder of some of their fellow militiamen.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we must, as we confirmed at the ACP summit on 1 November, force countries that legitimately claim to be our partners in dialogue, that we choose as partners and that request financial support from us, to comply with commonly accepted rules and with international conventions. With regard to Nigeria, this would involve fighting the implementation of the Islamic sharia – a woman was allowed to be stoned in front of television cameras a few weeks ago and not a single country reacted. At the same time, a climate of Islamophobia is developing, with mosques being burned down, and this too is met with widespread indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an independent inquiry must now be opened into the murders that took place in November 1999 and in October 2001. We should be aware that our colleagues in the Nigerian parliament have called these massacres examples of ‘ethnic cleansing’. I wish to end by saying that I have often called in this House for the debts of third world countries to be cancelled, but this debt cancellation must be conditional, Mr President, on these countries truly respecting human rights, workers’ rights and the rights of children and women. We must no longer accept these countries calling themselves democratic and signing conventions, which they then fail to observe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a swift, impartial, effective inquiry into these massacres. The Nigerian Federal government must guarantee full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law without delay. It is not doing so, despite the hopes placed in it. The Nigerian army is incapable of restoring law and order; moreover, this is not its role. Only a police force which respects human rights would be able to rebuild trust between the different communities. It is the duty of the European Parliament to condemn these massacres, which come on top of religious intolerance and miscarriages of justice. The way the sharia is currently being wrongly applied in Nigeria is a violation of fundamental human rights, especially the rights of women. Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria. There is an urgent need for a humanitarian aid system to be established for displaced persons and refugees. Lastly, the European Union should implement the procedure laid down by Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission is monitoring the situation within the framework of its powers and capabilities. In May 2001, the Commission issued a common position making provision for political dialogue with Nigeria to be strengthened. This common position is based on human rights and missions headed by European Union diplomats have been in contact with the Nigerian government. One mission was concerned with the economic situation and the other with human rights and the problem of human rights and the need for the government to intervene and take action have been highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The government has acknowledged the problems and stressed that it intends to continue its efforts along these lines but I believe that parliament has also set limits on the potential for this particular government to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points in the motions on which I should like to comment briefly. The first is the education of the security forces in the human rights sector. This is a new sector for the Community, which has come under military cooperation in the past. However, the Community is currently supporting this sort of programme in Algeria, Guatemala, the Ukraine and the Palestinian territories. The Commission is re-examining the potential for intervention in West Africa, Liberia and the Ivory Coast and, as far as Nigeria is concerned, the United Kingdom, France and the United States are involved in similar activities. The Commission is monitoring the problems within the specific framework of human rights, but it cannot intervene in the education of security forces for human rights unless the Nigerian government asks it to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, the European Commission is intervening wherever the national or local authorities are unable to deal with natural or man-made disasters, but only in countries which have asked for help from abroad. So far, Nigeria has not asked for any help. The local authorities are more or less coping with the problems arising mainly as the result of movements of the population within the country, but I must stress, as has already been said, that Nigeria's problems are of a seriously structural nature. Short-term development aid is not enough to cope with them. However, the Commission thinks it is important to monitor recent developments directly on the ground, which is why it is planning to despatch ECHO delegates to Nigeria to record the dangers already referred to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
