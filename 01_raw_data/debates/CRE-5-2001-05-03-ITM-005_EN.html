The best way to prevent the transmission of encephalopathies is to promote the controlled production of milk and beef. Such production would be based on local pasture and fodder. The quality of what is produced would be more important than the quantity. If these huge fodder imports are not investigated, the European Union will continue to act as a factory processing imported vegetable products to produce animal products. This state of affairs results in an enormous financial burden and a range of problems, relating to surpluses, quality, health and the environment. These have been described by other Members on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the majority of European herds are not contaminated. In particular, these include animals fed on grass and natural fodder produced on the farm itself, and not raised on industrial foodstuffs. These are the very animals the CAP has been ignoring for 40 years, and which we must now promote in order to protect the health of the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, future agricultural and environmental policy must reflect our experiences in this crucial area of food production.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated. Food is an internationally tradeable product and with consumers crossing frontiers on a daily basis, nothing short of a co-ordinated and common approach to food safety as spearheaded by the EU will restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain, and while there is a cost factor, particularly for farmers, it is I believe strongly in the interests of agriculture and individual farm families, that full confidence is restored as quickly as possible in all agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have taken positive and expensive steps to deal with BSE. The foot-and-mouth outbreak, which does not present a health risk, has to some extent overshadowed the very genuine steps taken to finally eliminate BSE from the European herd.</p>
<p class="contents">The action taken was scientifically based and I believe we are close to bringing this public health scare to a successful – and with strict adherence to production controls to a permanent – conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">While acknowledging the weight of the scientific evidence on the connection of BSE and CJD with the use of meat and bonemeal, it must be borne in mind that the level of BSE infestation proportionate to the individual herds in Member States is significantly small and is of course confined to a relatively short production cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers. We must never again experience the traumatic events of recent months and the understandable consumer concern with regard to food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is our assessment that we would not have achieved a better result by letting the matter go to a second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In our assessment of the compromise, we attached particular importance to the principles that, as a starting point, all documents should be included, including internal documents, that the number of exceptions should be reduced, and that these should be well-founded, that requests should be dealt with more quickly than was originally proposed and that it should be established that Danish authorities will continue to deal with requests for access to documents in accordance with Danish rules.</p>
<p class="contents">If a system is to enjoy our citizens’ confidence, it is not sufficient for it merely to be open under the rules. Instead, it must also be experienced as being open. A great deal of work remains to be done here by citizens and the press, who must use the new rules actively and who must also test the limits of these new rules. It is our hope that the coming years will show all the forces that are sceptical about transparency that it benefits not just democracy but also the institutions’ own internal work for the public to have access to the documents being worked on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Internal documents are not defined and are to be kept secret if their publication would have a decisive influence on a decision-making process. Member States may demand that documents be classified and, into the bargain, require that they not be recorded, without it being made clear which rules this is to take place under. Documents concerning the EU’s foreign, defence and security policy can be kept entirely out of the public domain and documents concerning internal security can similarly be kept secret. The rules will be of consequence in all the Member States, with national opportunities to create greater openness in the political process of the Member States now being subject to the Union’s common rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Public debate on the matter has been virtually non-existent, and the closed process under which the rules came about has hardly helped the project to move the Union closer to its citizens. The result gives the impression that the rapporteurs have hidden under the cloak of the Swedish Presidency in the hope that openness and the interests of public access to official records were covered by virtue of the Swedes’ long tradition of open government. However, it is obvious that the Swedes decided on a course of appeasement that has secured consensus in the Council rather than safeguarding citizens’ interests. In other words, the Swedes have helped legitimise the Regulation rather than defending citizens’ interests, and today the European Parliament has followed suit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council can sit back with satisfaction, and the European Parliament has negotiated on the basis of its own interest in achieving access to a range of confidential documents without guaranteeing that a single document will be delivered. This cannot be said to be in the public interest, and it is now clear that the public has been held hostage in a struggle concerning the European Parliament’s own interests in which the European Parliament, in the end, decided to sacrifice the hostage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compromise that has now been adopted by the European Parliament is an important step along the way to increased openness and improved efficiency in the institutions. Moreover, the new rules are clearly better than the lawless situation in respect of public access to documents that currently prevails. At the same time, we nonetheless see a number of problems with the new rules on public access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Sensitive documents that are classified as secret, for example with reference to general security, are exempted from the principle of public access and do not need to be logged. The author of a sensitive document is the person who decides whether the recipient may make it available to others. These rules are in total conflict with the Swedish principle of public access to official records that has characterised Swedish government for over 250 years. The Swedish Presidency has asserted that the special rules concerning sensitive documents will only cover documents concerning foreign and security policy. However, we see a great risk that sensitive documents may very well also come to include documents that concern other areas, such as the Schengen cooperation and the common policy on refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are concerned that the Swedish constitution, with its roots dating back to 1766, will come under threat as a result of unclear EU rules. The introduction to the Regulation states that the purpose is not to change existing legislation in the Member States. At the same time, the Commission forced through the deletion of a reference to national legislation right at the last minute. Nonetheless, we presume that the Commission will keep its promise and maintain the Member States’ right to take decisions independently concerning the provision of documents. Throughout the decision-making process, the Commission has worked against increased openness and access for its citizens in order instead to defend the classifying of documents. This suggests that the old-fashioned Commission is still characterised by bureaucracy and an unwillingness to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully the new Regulation on citizens’ access to documents is an important step on the way towards even clearer rules capable of forming a basis for a modernised administration in which openness and access are a matter of course. The Regulation states that the rules will be reviewed in January 2004 at the latest. We are voting in favour of the report today in the conviction that this is just the first step towards a more open EU. The ELDR Group will be pushing the issue further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The currently proposed form of restricted disclosure could even be a means of systematically protecting documents from priers, which are now hardly accessible to society. Those in favour of the compromise do not seem too keen either, but they still call on everyone to vote for the proposal. Their main arguments are that the outcome without the compromise would be even worse, and that they expect that something better will come up after the 2004 evaluation. Those opposing disclosure have not spoken out in the debate at all, but without such opponents, difficult negotiations behind the scenes would not have been necessary and we would have been able to vote on a better outcome today.

We are aware that this is a difficult and sensitive area in a number of ways, for example because of the fact that it must be possible to classify certain documents and exempt them from public access and because of the fact that the rules for openness and public access vary widely between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we regret the way in which this matter has been dealt with in the committee, i.e. through a process that is not described in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure and has not previously been the practice. The result has been that a conciliation was negotiated between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as early as during the first reading, without individual parliamentarians or the public being given opportunity to follow the process. This is remarkable for a matter that deals precisely with openness and public access. The Verts/ALE Group believes that the issue of openness deserved a longer discussion process in which the citizens of the EU could have followed the progress of the matter better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the legal basis that is the combination of Article 37, on the organisation of the agricultural markets, and Article 152, on phytosanitary and veterinary measures. Article 152(1)(2) only states that “Community action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health…” There is no mention of harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, there is the question of the added value of the Union: without any harmonisation of health policy, the fight against rabies has produced very good results in Europe, enabling quarantine measures, for example, to be lifted in Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of the financial implications for pet owners of the proposal for a regulation: tattooing carried out by a vet costs around FRF 150 whereas fitting a microchip will cost between FRF 400 and FRF 500 francs. Tattooing, which has been tested in health and veterinary practice in France, has the advantage of being immediately readable, thereby making the search for the animal’s owner straightforward and rapid and does not require any reading equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal would require the standardisation of transponders (Standard ISO 11784) and of reading equipment for the microchips (Standard ISO 11785). In any event, the person responsible for the animal must not be responsible, when checks are carried out, for the equipment needed to read the microchip.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the eight-year transitional period, both methods of identification – tattoo and transponder – must coexist. The owner must be given the choice of which method of identification he or she prefers.</p>
<p class="contents">As for those who are pressing for the widespread use of transponders for reasons of animal welfare, we feel that that is another debate altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we oppose the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe should, in the current situation, bring all its political and economic weight to bear, particularly on ensuring that the various key players take part in a genuine round of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could seek to have the constitution amended so that it recognises the Albanians as a constituent people of the Republic and to make it easier to acquire Macedonian citizenship. The Albanian language should be recognised as an official language of Macedonia, from primary school to university and also in the public services. Greater internal autonomy could be given to the regions which have an Albanian majority. Albanians should also be given better access to public sector jobs, in which they are currently under-represented.</p>
<p class="contents">If none of these measures are implemented, there is a danger that tensions between the two communities will worsen in the short-term. Furthermore, criminalising one community in the eyes of the other by calling it ‘terrorist’ only further muddies the waters. Rather than pursuing this policy, as the report suggests, Parliament should encourage the Macedonian government to negotiate with the parties representing the Albanians, in order to find constitutional solutions, which will enable a lasting peace to be achieved in Macedonia. For these reasons, we will not be voting in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This pretension is both dishonest and vain. It is dishonest because rivalry between great European powers has contributed in a major way to the collapse of Yugoslavia and to the conflicts which preceded the collapse or which have resulted from it. Air operations in Serbia and Kosovo by the major powers, particularly the European powers, have not improved and, in fact, have worsened the climate of inter-ethnic hostility that has been fostered and cultivated by nationalist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This pretension is vain because, despite the “enhanced presence and strong commitment by KFOR” of which the recommendation boasts, the activity of armed groups seeking to cut off and control the community of their own nationality and to terrorise the nationality that they have declared to be their enemy is continuing and growing worse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our intention to endorse the diplomatic and military operations undertaken in the Balkans by the great powers because, rather than bringing peace to the region, they are helping to increase the people’s suffering. Although the peoples of the Balkans have been paying for the prejudices of the political leaders of their own ruling classes with their blood for over a century, they are paying an infinitely higher price for the actions of the major European powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we voted against the recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are Belgium, Switzerland, Moldavia and Macedonia. In part of the country, a large majority of the inhabitants speak a language which is the same as, or related to, that in the neighbouring country. The same applies to another section of the population, but involves a completely different language. In many cases, the inhabitants dislike the fact that they are being cut off from their same-language neighbours and wonder why they are still part of a state which unites them with another area of which they can hardly understand the language, if at all. Anyone who wants to keep such countries united, must ensure that there are no second-class citizens, no winners or losers, nor subordinates. This can only be done if the people are governed and educated in the majority language of their part of the country. Since the Macedonian government has not yet come to this realisation, it is driving part of its inhabitants to despair. It does pride itself on the presence of Albanian ministers, but does not ensure collective equality as it is in place in Belgium and Switzerland. Granting financial aid now and promising the country EU membership could lull that government into thinking that it need not solve that problem, and that it can ignore the anger of a large section of the population. By granting this premature aid, we are inciting unintended state violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then, a moment later, a thought occurred to me and I said to her: "But what if, when I get to Brussels, they ask me for a euro with a Belgian face on and they will not accept a euro with an Italian or a Greek face on, and so on and so forth?"

At the moment, they are giving the public neither a financial guarantee against the risk of counterfeit euros, nor financial aid for adaptation measures, as if this were a straightforward operation of replacing one set of notes with another. This is not the case at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a quite exceptional and hazardous operation, which involves both replacing all coins and notes and at the same time changing all the points of reference. If we are to succeed in this exceptional undertaking, to reassure the public and to give them support, which is essential, exceptional means must be provided, with, of course, the corresponding budgets. Admittedly, these budgets would probably prove to be very high. They would not satisfy the Maastricht criteria for public deficits. This is a paradox about this operation which we have to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to resolve this paradox, we could first of all consider removing the budgets for the introduction of the euro from the calculation of the 3% deficit. This would clearly be a definitive operation. We would then have to find the money, at a time when economic growth is, of course, slowing down in Europe and when tax revenue will be falling. We could put forward various ideas on this matter, including that of levying a ‘special introduction of the euro’ tax on the profits of large companies, since they will be the main beneficiaries of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I maintain my conclusion that it is dishonest and irresponsible to act as we are today, attempting to shift the cost of introducing the euro onto hundreds of thousands of ‘little people’ who cannot fight back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must now face the consequences, which were deliberately played down when we should have addressed them properly, of taking political decisions favouring the introduction of the euro, which now appear to be very serious for the everyday life of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that it was not necessary for the euro to become an active currency. There was no financial need for it. This is a purely political decision, which stems from the desire to completely eradicate national currencies. If our recommendation had been accepted for the euro to be chosen, not as the single currency, but as a common currency with precedence over national currencies for certain uses likely to develop in line with the real needs of society, as a complementary currency and not as a substitute currency, we would not be facing this enormous problem of counterfeiting today.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur is legitimately concerned about the authenticity checks which banking establishments will clearly have to carry out. I am surprised and shocked, however, that no proposals have been made specifically to help future victims of euro counterfeiters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the duty of those who have made the political choice to introduce the euro, in other words, the most traumatic choice they could inflict on our citizens, resulting in the sudden and total loss of the yardstick by which they establish different values in their everyday lives, to accept full responsibility for the consequences of their decision.</p>

The euro currency is already an international reserve and a transaction currency. The euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world’s most counterfeited currency, unless we all make concerted efforts to ensure that the counterfeiters are defeated.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro currency does run a particular risk of being counterfeited at the time when it is introduced into circulation and during the period when it will circulate alongside national notes and coins. I am referring primarily to the months of January and February of next year when many people will be unfamiliar with the actual make-up of the euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting must involve all EU Member States, EU institutions and all relevant international organisations. A comprehensive legal framework must be put in place which can be operated in a uniform manner across all the territories of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that the only international instrument which is designed to prevent and punish currency counterfeiting is the Geneva Convention of 1929. The Convention is fairly ineffectual in its purpose. That is one of the reasons why Member States within the European Union have adopted different pieces of legislation to guarantee that criminals who commit counterfeiting are vigorously punished.</p>
<p class="contents">EU leaders were correct in Nice last December when they stated that an effective system to protect the euro against counterfeiting must be adopted as soon as possible this year. The arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting will be based primarily on information which will fall into two categories. The first of these concerns technical information such as data collection, manufacturing methods and the technical features of counterfeits. The co-ordination of this information will be the responsibility of the counterfeiting analysis centre which has been<span class="bold"> </span>set up under<span class="bold"> </span>the auspices of the European Central Bank. The second concerns police information which is intended to assist in the gathering of data relating to counterfeiting at both strategic and operational levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro and the disappearance of national currencies will ensure a shift from the protection of certain national interests to the protection of a Community interest. This will involve developing forms of co-operation and co-ordination between the key players and the Member States which will be responsible for combating any counterfeiting of the euro. This will clearly involve banks, the police and judicial authorities as well as the relevant EU bodies and institutions such as the European Central Bank, OLAF and Europol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the overwhelming view of the vast majority of European Union Governments as well as being the strong opinion of the European Parliament. For example, some people seek to contend that the use of ecstasy should be deemed as being quite normal in society. I find this contention difficult to support, particularly in the light of the fact that there has already been a vast number of deaths, both in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about one thing. The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown. Ecstasy is a drug that certainly is a cause for depression but it may also cause memory impairment as well as other illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs. While the European economy is performing strongly, we must equally ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a structured and streamlined manner. That is why monies must always be put aside for the development of youth facilities in disadvantaged areas that suffer from drug abuse or which are likely to suffer from drug abuse in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">To combat drug abuse there must be a partnership approach put in place involving police authorities, social groups, voluntary organisations and local authorities.

The resolution takes care not to endorse the replacement in Ukraine of ‘Russian and old’ nuclear power stations with ‘Western and modern’ nuclear power stations. It recommends a long-term policy which specifically includes energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources. It questions the reliability of the ‘risk model’ used by the official agencies. These measures are all in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Even today, however, the European authorities have not really learnt the lessons from this disaster. The resolution itself does no more than recommend the closure of ‘at risk’ nuclear power stations. The causes of the accident, however, were not primarily technological ones. What Chernobyl shows above all is what happens when a nuclear power goes into crisis – a social crisis rather than a technical one. The accident was not, therefore, specifically Russian: it has universal significance and unveils one of the great lies peddled by the apostles of nuclear power. These ‘nucleocrats’ act ‘as if’ our societies could for centuries manage a form of energy that presents an immeasurable risk and will never experience a crisis. The lessons from the last century and the current chaos in the world suffice to show how irresponsible this premise is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, the report calls for veterinary medicinal products for which no maximum residue limits have been established to be excluded from the ban on the use of these products in feeding and fattening food-producing animals.</p>
<p class="contents">We disagree with this derogation, nor do we accept the spurious argument that pharmaceutical multinationals supposedly have no interest in developing suitable veterinary medicinal products. On the contrary, we emphasise the need to adopt and comply with ever stricter control procedures throughout the entire animal food cycle (feedingstuffs, medicinal products, processing of foods of animal origin etc.) so that the system for producing foods of animal origin can be controlled as tightly as possible. Not, of course, that we are labouring under the misapprehension that controls which fully guarantee the safety of the food produced are possible in a capitalist system.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we agree with the rapporteur’s call for a pan-European licensing system for medicinal products. Such a system would basically abolish the control mechanisms and services of the Member States, which are responsible for controlling marketing applications for medicinal products, as they will be forced to accept licences issued by another Member State.</p>

The recipe described for a low rate of inflation is wage restraint and fiscal prudence, rather than limiting the profits made by monopolies. It alleges that 'structural reform' and liberalisation make a contribution to development (obviously of big business, not the workers). The report calls for harmony between the social partners and the further development of flexible types of work to allow "structural reform to continue speedily [with the] structural changes intended to increase flexibility and competitiveness in all factor, product and labour markets". It recommends more flexible markets, starting with the job market, and calls for trades unions to ensure there is 'harmony' in collective bargaining, i.e. to accept flexible forms of work as the norm, the dismantling of their achievements and increased poverty with no conditions attached so that the European monopolies can earn more and be more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">It avoids explaining why, despite the increase in the rate of growth and the huge reduction in the cost of labour, there has been no concomitant reduction in unemployment which, it agrees, is extremely high. It considers the application of stability and convergence programmes to be extremely important and welcomes Greece’s first stability programme, which demanded and, in fact, still demands continuous programmes of increasingly strict, unilateral, barbaric and inhumane austerity. It is a policy of job insecurity and increasing unemployment and poverty among workers, a policy to disenfranchise the rural population and increase the profits of the ruling class in our country.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the obligations imposed by the stability agreement and the strict recommendations accompanying the reports by the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Greece, the austerity policy needs to be stepped up, the reversal in employment relations and in the social and welfare system needs to become the norm and privatisation needs to continue at an even faster pace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Katiforis report confirms that the European Parliament supports the application of stability and convergence programmes, the coordination of anti-grass roots measures between Member States and Community guidance and supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against this report which promises more poverty for the workers and new mega-profits for big business and which is intended to undermine everything the workers have achieved. However, the best response is for the workers to take to the streets in the various countries of Europe and in Greece in huge, mass, rallies and strikes against these barbaric measures and programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Instead of encouraging a change of direction in the economic guidelines we follow, however, the downward revision of the economic growth rate and the slowdown of the world economy are calling for more of the same: to pursue and step up fiscal prudence, especially the reduction of public expenditure and wage moderation as a means of guaranteeing the objective of price stability, to which the European Union is, unacceptably, continuing to subordinate all its economic guidelines and social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur adheres closely to this philosophy, following the Lisbon strategy, in particular the objective of creating, within a decade, the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy. It is, therefore, not surprising that he calls for wage moderation and links the establishment of "suitable wage policies" to tax reductions, which is in line “with the structural changes intended to increase flexibility and competitiveness in all factor, product and labour markets” and that he considers that “structural reforms and liberalisation” can make a “decisive contribution” to the objective outlined in Lisbon. I have therefore voted against this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless worth pointing out something positive, which is the rapporteur’s approach to investment, particularly the importance of public investment, which was completely ignored by the Commission, with regard to a variable that is crucial for the sustainability of economic growth and for creating employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur on this subject, I had an obligation to speak and I wished to emphasise that the European Commission’s proposal on the new FPRTD has taken account of this requirement, since the second priority, of the 7+1 priorities, focuses on technologies for the Information Society. It was clear that a sector that represented such considerable progress would be given a prominent place in this multi-annual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I largely approve of the report’s requests, whilst at the same time deploring their excessively liberal tone. The rapporteur often forgets that these new technologies must exist, first and foremost, to serve the public. He is right to say that EU and Member State resources should focus on pre-competitive projects, with the objective of ensuring a powerful EU presence in the<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>global development of next generation Internet and new communications infrastructures<span class="bold"><span class="italic">,</span></span> reinforcing the EU's role in Internet governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would point out that our Parliament voted, in the part-session of March 2001, for the Carraro report, which focused on the place that the Member States and the European Union should occupy within ICANN [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers] – a private, non-profit company that has produced several key Internet systems – and which recommends opening up this system to developing countries. I am delighted that the Harbour report takes up these two points again.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Harbour, I support the strategy of seeking to promote the 'centres of excellence' referred to in the Commission’s proposals for creating a European research area, even if, I repeat, this concept needs to be clarified. I think it is a good idea that one of these centres should specialise in electronic communication, but we have not yet reached that point!</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the rapid creation of a super fast trans-European research network with a capacity of 100 gigabytes per second, this is, of course, an essential prerequisite to achieving an economy that is competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based, as defined in Lisbon. I shall take this opportunity to repeat insist on the fact that super fast Internet must benefit all strata of society. This is what I would have liked to see in my report on Universal Service and the new communications networks. Unfortunately, my amendments on this subject were rejected, largely at the behest of Mr Harbour! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for a resolution, which I support, must, in addition, stress certain points, which will make it possible to better define a future scenario which, considering that the sector evolves extremely rapidly, also changes extremely rapidly and includes certain discoveries that demand abrupt changes and rethinks. However, with regard to bandwidth, it is appropriate to study the possible role in the future of the Internet of the use of satellites for two-way telecommunication as well and the use of terminals for DTT. Those who are concerned, for example, with mountain regions know that some technologies lend themselves better to use in isolated areas, where technologies such as cable are difficult, and that the new technologies are absolutely crucial to avoid marginalisation in places where it would be even more serious than elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many areas to cover, ranging from the widespread local use of microwave systems to interactive 'broadband' services, from the need to make the Internet more user-friendly by making it possible to access it without a computer, to the aspects of network security, which have already been studied on a number of occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The great caution needed is clear. Evidence of this is, for example, the explosion,<span class="bold"> </span>which has already happened in the United States but also in some European countries as well, of the myth that the dot com market will develop exponentially.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the sensitive but key subject of standards to regulate the Web, intended not to restrict free space but to prevent abuse and improper or even vandalistic use. Finally, it must be remembered that the Internet must combine the globalisation process, which is an inherent part of its development, with the need for multimedia services at regional and local levels, thus providing that proximity and closeness to the citizen that is a genuine asset and must be enhanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
