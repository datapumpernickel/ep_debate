After all it has been found that soldiers and civilians who came into contact with depleted uranium ammunition in earlier military conflicts, such as the Gulf War in 1991 and in Kosovo, later experienced serious health problems, what we call Gulf War sickness or Balkan syndrome. They suffer from memory loss, chronic pain and fatigue, symptoms of paralysis and have an increased risk of cancer. United Nations statistics, published in the renowned 'British Medical Journal', indicate that the incidence of cancer in southern Iraq increased sevenfold between 1989 and 1994. Even the US Army Environmental Policy Institute has acknowledged the potentially very serious medical consequences of the use of depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="contents">Weapons and ammunition that harm the civilian population are in contravention of the Geneva Convention and the Convention on Conventional Weapons. The second Convention is very explicit. It imposes a prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons that are deemed to cause excessive injury or that do not discriminate between military and civilian targets. According to information leaked from the Pentagon, about 3 000 guided bombs were fired in the first wave of attacks in Iraq. It seems very likely that the US will use ammunition with depleted uranium again. Parliament must continue to warn of the potential dangers of the use of this type of ammunition. There is an urgent need for an independent, scientific study of the effects of its use, not only on health but also on the environment. We must have a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium while we wait for the results of such a study.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must play a pioneering role in this, just as it did in the campaign for a worldwide ban on antipersonnel mines, as was laid down in the Ottawa Convention. And my questions, Mr President, concern that Convention, its ratification and application. To be very explicit, I wanted to ask the Council exactly what actions are planned to ensure that as many Member States and candidate countries as possible sign this Convention. You will understand that I would really like to hear from the current President-in-Office of the Council why Greece is actually waiting before signing this important Convention. Finally, in anticipation of hopefully being able to avoid a possible international conflict, I urge the Council to make a clear statement guaranteeing that the Member States of the European Union will not use weapons that are banned under international law or are deemed to be illegal in this or any future armed conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On impact, the uranium is broken up into fine particles which are likely to be inhaled by human beings, or else they are dispersed into the environment where, owing to the effect of the wind, they can become suspended, and inhaled later.</p>
<p class="contents">These particles emit alpha-radioactivity, which is particularly aggressive towards living tissue. Depleted uranium particles, once lodged inside an organism, may cause severe damage to the health not only of military personnel but of civilians as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear to me, therefore, that depleted uranium weapons and ammunition fall directly within the scope of the 1980 United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights came to this conclusion several years ago, yet so far no action has been taken to restrict or prohibit them. Scientific uncertainty about their measurable effects on health is thus being used as an argument for doing nothing. The precautionary principle, however, would seem to argue in favour of an additional protocol to the 1980 Convention, explicitly prohibiting these depleted uranium weapons. This is what my group is seeking.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week we were in Iraq, and at the hospital in Basra we were shocked and saddened to see children suffering from cancer and congenital malformations. The figures published by the University of Basra for the region are shocking. Between 1990 and 2001, the rate of congenital malformations has been constantly rising, and has now increased sevenfold. Scientists are quite logically blaming this on the fact that parents are contaminated with depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the right to allow such situations, which are the consequences of real war crimes, to proliferate. Yet in Afghanistan, contrary to the official denials, even more powerful weapons were used, weapons equipped with a covering of depleted uranium or even natural uranium. These were guided bombs or cruise missiles.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is up to the European Union to take the initiative to halt the current escalation and to set targets with a view to the definitive prohibition of weapons which, like cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines, are morally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore think it important also to get the Council and the Commission to follow up this very important matter of how best to emphasise to one’s partners, and in any future situation, that to use anti-personnel mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium is to use weapons that strike indiscriminately, that hit civilian as well as non-civilian targets, that hit the innocent as well as the guilty and that can be dormant for a long time and only make themselves felt perhaps years after a possible war is over. These are weapons that are contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on how we are to treat one another in the course of war.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think the Council and the Commission should understand that, firstly, we must prevent these types of war crime from being committed. We must prevent these weapons being used in possible future conflicts and, clearly, we are all nowadays thinking of Iraq in this connection. There are, however, other places too in which this could be relevant. That was the first aspect. The second is to follow up those crimes that have already been committed. In that connection, I should also very much like to hear the Council’s and the Commission’s answers regarding how these crimes are to be followed up and how it is to be ensured that those who are responsible for using weapons in ways that constitute war crimes are dragged before the International War Crimes Tribunal and prosecuted, for it is not enough for us to have a set of ground rules. We must also be prepared to apply them, and we must be prepared to apply the sanctions available to us at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the EU that must take this task upon itself. Otherwise, we shall end up in a world in which only the strong make the decisions, in which only the strong can do as they see fit and in which weak countries are entirely subject to the diktat of a stronger power. I eagerly await the Council’s and the Commission’s answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us who have been to countries in conflict will know the mutilations and wounds with which one is confronted there. I myself became familiar with these sights in Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has, in various resolutions, insisted on the implementation of the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which banned the use of landmines. It is with reference to this that I want to praise the Commission for the excellent work it has done, not only in the field of mine clearance, but also in educating people as to why landmines have to be banned. Work is progressing at present on preparations for the next conference on the revision of the Ottawa Convention, which is to be held this September in Bangkok, by which time I very much hope that those European states that have not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention will have made good their omission. I look forward to hearing what the President-in-Office of the Council will have to say in response to this question. I think he might well be about to bring Parliament good news from Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The worldwide campaign against landmines has already made great progress. Considerable efforts are currently being made to get belligerent parties other than states to sign up to the Ottawa Convention. This work is being undertaken by a non-governmental organisation – 'Appell de Genève' – and I believe that we can rejoice that such work is being done by non-governmental organisations when state bodies cannot carry it out. In Somalia, for example, 15 organisations and belligerent parties, none of them part of any state apparatus, have signed the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem of a particularly shattering nature comes in the form of cluster bombs, whose victims include innocent civilians; the injuries these bombs inflict are so horrific and their effects so indiscriminate, that they should be prohibited outright. Previous speakers have described this, and I wish to touch on it only very briefly. You are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrendous injuries resulting from the deployment of cluster bombs. The particularly dreadful thing about it is that the splinters from the cluster bombs that remain in the human body are almost never capable of being removed. Not only are the effects of these bombs indiscriminate in that they can strike civilians as much as soldiers, but they are also imprecise in the area they affect, which amounts to something like 350 football fields every time a cluster bomb is dropped. This makes the precision bombing of military targets impossible, so that there is an increased risk of innocent people being injured. Finally, these bombs also vary in their effect over time, since, if they do not explode, they can remain live for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in December 2001 that Parliament last recalled the 1980 UN agreement on certain conventional weapons and demanded an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs. A moratorium can clearly only be the second best solution until such time as a ban on these inhuman weapons becomes enforceable, but I believe that imposing a moratorium in the first instance is the pragmatic way to go about things. It is here that the European Union could, by its actions, give a very good example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject speaks for itself. We have all seen the television footage of maimed children, including recently in various areas of former Yugoslavia. Most of what I have to say has to do with depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="contents">Natural uranium contains over 99% uranium 238 and very little uranium 235. Uranium 235 is excellent as a fuel in nuclear reactors and is used in nuclear weapons. Consequently, the material is enriched with uranium 235 and what is left, the residue, which is mainly uranium 238, is what we know as depleted uranium. This depleted uranium is used in bombs because it is very dense and highly penetrating; it can blast through floors, tank armouring and so on. However, the drawback is that it vaporises when it explodes. And when it vaporises, most of it oxidises. These oxides end up as soluble uranium salts over an area of 10-15 kilometres, although they are often carried several hundred kilometres on the wind. They can be inhaled, enter the water supply and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with uranium 238 is that it has very weak alpha rays, meaning that I can hold it my hand without coming to any harm, but if I inhale it, because the body has phagocytes which absorb these particles, the cells are irradiated very close to their genetic material and this is thought to be the cause of the harmful effects of depleted uranium. Of course, research carried out has not proven 100% that this is what happens, but the results are very convincing, which is why we must be very, very careful. That is exactly what Parliament’s motion says; that because it is highly likely that it represents a public health risk and that exposure to depleted uranium is dangerous, the European Union (this is point 7) needs to monitor this research and everything else to do with depleted uranium, including possible extensive environmental pollution and the long-term dangers to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly logical that the European Parliament should take an interest in this sort of issue; it needs to be taken into account so that we can avoid using this ammunition because, I repeat, it has huge drawbacks. Also, depleted uranium takes several thousand years to decay. If an area is contaminated, it remains contaminated for thousands of years. The principle of precaution alone should make us think twice about using this ammunition which, I repeat, can contaminate areas for thousands of years, with long-term dangers to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to ask my honourable friends to vote in favour of this motion which, I think, for both mines and depleted uranium ammunition, is a commensurate response to the current situation. I think that the European Parliament should vote for it and that the Commission should take up and monitor this issue. I trust that the Council and the Greek Presidency will do something about getting the Ottawa Convention ratified, so that anti-personnel mines can be eliminated, and introducing a moratorium, followed perhaps by a total ban on the use of depleted uranium ammunition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will therefore be easier to assess all the consequences underlying this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, war is always war and its effects are always appalling. The fact is, however, that sometimes we cannot escape the need for military intervention or its inevitability. This is why we must concern ourselves with the long-term effects of this ordnance, out of consideration in particular for the innocent victims and most frequently, those harmed by their effects after operations have ended.</p>
<p class="contents">There is growing concern amongst interested communities and also amongst the general public in this field. With regard to the specific case of ammunition that contains depleted uranium, the lack of rigorous clinical proof that clearly confirms the cause-and-effect relationship between its use and the occurrence of diseases must lead us to invest even more heavily in research into this possible connection. This is where the Council’s action could be extremely useful, particularly in supporting the work of groups of government experts on the leftovers of war, such as explosives and anti-tank mines, and in giving priority to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Next it is crucial that the Council and also the Commission heed the results obtained and present, within the scope of their respective competences, practical recommendations or measures to help to improve and increase the reliability of ordnance with a view to eliminating the lethal damage it causes following conflicts. Incidentally, and to conclude, Mr President, I wish to say a few words about the people that this debate is seeking to protect. Even without conclusive proof, it is a requisite of conscience to provide effective forms of support for victims and their families, whether or not they are military personnel, who have been affected after the end of a conflict and whose suffering could be related to unexploded ordnance or depleted uranium ammunition. This would not be the first such action. Portugal, for example, has been doing just this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from directly killing and injuring civilians, explosive remnants of war often hamper humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping forces, reconstruction following conflict and development in general, which is why the Union has taken an active part in the debate on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to quote a few examples of Union activities in this sector. In June 2001, the Union circulated a discussion paper on explosive remnants of war at the meeting held on the subject in the run-up to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council issued conclusions on 19 November 2001 promoting the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, in which it called on the second review congress to set up a working party on explosive remnants of war.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union submitted a working paper to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva in December 2001, calling for legal instruments to be introduced in order to deal with explosive remnants of war, as a result of which efforts will be made to prevent explosive remnants of war, including through provisions requiring them to be more reliably designed and to have self-destruct mechanisms, and to prevent physical injury from detonators in explosive remnants of war.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union also submitted a paper on explosive remnants of war to the team of government experts set up by the second review congress.</p>
<p class="contents">During the congress of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the Presidency stressed on behalf of the European Union that the introduction of a legally binding instrument on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention was a priority issue for the Union. The congress agreed with the recommendation of the team of government experts that negotiations should start on an instrument for these explosives. The Council’s competent working party will be discussing future Union action in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out on behalf of the Council that the Member States of the Union are not unanimously in favour of declaring an immediate moratorium on the use of all types of cluster bombs. The Council has not received reports of any NATO members using cluster bombs. The common action by the Union in November 1997 dealt in its first three articles with the question of the universality of the agreement banning mines, in which the Member States of the Union set a target of totally eliminating anti-personnel mines worldwide. The common action authorised the Presidency to take suitable measures. These measures have consisted to date of demarches to countries which have not yet signed up to the Convention, including associated countries, and it has also recommended that churches sign the Convention. These demarches are carried out by the Presidency at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also been promoting the universality of the Convention at all the appropriate fora, especially the United Nations. The resolutions of the General Assembly on the application of the Convention have been unanimously supported by the Member States of the European Union. In addition, the European Parliament and Council resolutions of 23 July 2001 concerning action against anti-personnel landmines in developing countries and in third countries other than developing countries both state in article 3 that operations against landmines financed by the Union must in principle benefit those countries which are party to the convention banning landmines. Exceptions may only be made for humanitarian reasons. This stand by the Union has created an important incentive for countries to sign up to the convention banning landmines.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States are the main international source of funding for action against landmines, which in itself is an important way of promoting compliance with the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that no reports have been submitted to the Council on the use of depleted uranium ammunition by the American or British forces during the intervention in Afghanistan. The Council has not addressed the question of the application of the protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on non-detectable fragments to which all the Member States are party.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has the Council discussed ongoing work on this question at the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council does not have a catalogue of depleted uranium ammunition in current use. Decisions on the use of various types of ammunition are taken by Member States exercising their national sovereignty. All the Member States are party to the Geneva Conventions. Similarly, the Council has received no information about the use of depleted uranium ammunition in Chechnya, nor has it discussed the possibility of making the use of cluster bombs or depleted uranium a war crime under the statute of the International Criminal Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the Commission perspective, I want, in particular, to refer to the opinion of the Euratom Treaty Article 31 Expert Group which was convened in early 2001, with the participation not only of Member States experts but also representatives of UNEP, the IAEA, the WHO and Nato.</p>
<p class="contents">The group focused on the lasting contamination from the use of depleted uranium ammunitions in the Balkans and the potential post-war radiological risk for the health of the local population and the international assistance teams.</p>
<p class="contents">The group did not look at the actual health effect on soldiers who had been on mission in that region, this being outside the Community remit and to be handled in other fora such as Nato. Again I refer Parliament to the conclusions of its own STOA report of May 2001, when it came to much the same conclusion in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 March 2001, the opinion of the Article 31 Expert Group was released to the press. In a nutshell, it concluded that there is no major concern, from a radiological point of view, either in terms of inducing short-term cancer, or in terms of a wide impact on the environment. Widespread intervention in the concerned regions was not required.</p>
<p class="contents">Other reports issued by UNEP on 13 March 2001, the WHO on 1 May 2002 and the UK Royal Society on 12 March 2002 present similar conclusions. In addition, the latter two reports also address the chemical toxicity of the uranium, concluding that it is not expected that adverse effects on the kidneys or any other organ will occur.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of March 2001, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, concluded that no further actions seemed to be required with regard to the application of the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. As mentioned above, further investigations into the chemical toxicity not addressed in the report of Mrs Wallström have since been analysed in the WHO and the UK Royal Society reports.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Article 31 Expert Group had concluded that there was no need for individual monitoring of the Commission's own staff and contractors sent to the region, the Commission's medical services nonetheless proposed a check-up and urine analysis programme for the staff members concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">No single health effect related to depleted uranium has been observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming now to the Commission's activities related to anti-personnel landmines following the European Parliament and Council Regulations 1724/2001 and 1725/2001 on the reinforcement of the European Union contribution to the fight against APLs, the European Union has taken a leading role in fostering better coordination of programmes and in providing momentum, predictability and effectiveness for cooperation between partners on the ground. This is very strong support by the European Community for the implementation of the mine ban treaty that is the Ottawa Convention, according to which all APLs should be eliminated by 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, under the new APL regulation providing for a dedicated legal basis for coordination at European Union level, the Community budget contributed up to EUR 30 million for demining actions. Using various Community instruments such as geographical, ECHO, APL and RRM budget lines in an integrated way, the European Commission has mainly supported surveys, clearance, assistance to victims, as well as the economic and social rehabilitation of the demined regions and the resettled populations.</p>
<p class="contents">At European Union level the European Community efforts and the Member States' activities combined total EUR 143 million. The European Union is, therefore, with the US, the top contributor in the fight against APLs, including stockpile destruction and creation of local capacity-building.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure sustainability over the years, the Commission approved in December 2002 the European Commission mine action strategy and multiannual indicative programming for the period 2002-2004. This document was prepared on the basis of strong coordination with the Member States, the United Nations, the US, and the wider mine action community. The Commission will, in the coming weeks, make the necessary arrangements to present this strategy to the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, coming to the issue of cluster bombs and other forms of unexploded ordnance, the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) is the current international framework that provides the basis for the prohibition and elimination of weapons which operate in an indiscriminate fashion or cause excessive injury and suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Most EU Member States are parties to the CCW and are working on the revision of the Convention to further prohibit certain designs of weapon, such as explosive remnants of war, anti-handling devices, and to establish common principles on fuse insensitivity, self-destruction or self-neutralising weapon modes. These principles, if agreed, would be applied to anti-vehicle mines and submunitions – or munitions delivered by a remote carrier such as an aircraft, missile, minefield launcher and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The revision of the CCW is still at the level of working groups: one on anti-vehicles mines, the other on submunitions. The Commission closely follows the debates of both groups. This revision would lead to a new protocol to the CCW to address the problems caused by explosive remnants of war, thus covering cluster bombs and submunitions, so that these weapons are detectable and equipped with effective self-destruction mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The work being carried out in view of the new protocol is strongly sponsored by the EU through a common position and a number of joint démarches requesting that concrete steps be undertaken to address this issue under the CCW framework. Currently, the opportunity to prepare a further common position on the suggestions tabled is being explored.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by mentioning that, in addition to its participation in the international framework of the CCW, the Commission, on a concrete and operational level through its activities related to APLs, is already providing an indirect but tangible contribution to the reduction of the threat posed by cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance. Mine-clearance encompasses<span class="italic"> de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span> clearance of other unexploded ordnance, although this is not a specific submunitions instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already engaged in such broader clearance activities in countries such as Laos, Kosovo and Afghanistan, where the APL problem is inextricably connected to unexploded ordnance pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For once, a technical expert is about to address the House on the subject, in particular, of depleted uranium weapons. It is most important that we do not, whether consciously or not, have any confusion in our minds – either in the minds of the public or, as I have seen in this House, in our own – about the use of depleted uranium weapons and the use of nuclear weapons. On this point you have given us vital information and I simply want to add my own personal testimony.</p>
<p class="contents">Depleted uranium weapons are weapons which were developed in order to enable new types of armour-plating to be pierced. The armour-plating used in the Second World War was pierced by shells with a hollow charge, powered by chemical energy. New types of armour-plating, however, can only be pierced by weapons powered by kinetic energy. These are known as arrow shells. It is important to be able to give them a high initial speed. They must also have heavy cores. This is why depleted uranium is used. Here I must stress that the confusion which I am talking about is not innocent. I heard on television a journalist who was covering our Members’ visit to Iraq mention enriched uranium in connection with these weapons, and it was mentioned on two occasions, so it could not have been a mere slip of the tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">I was involved in the research that led to the development of these weapons, in the Terrestrial Weapons Technical Directorate, where we have very powerful unions which protect our workers and our engineers. I am therefore able to tell you that in actual fact, if there had been the slightest risk, the precautionary principle which we observe in the French arms industry would automatically have ruled out such weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am aware, and if my memory serves me right, it even has its civilian uses, but that is something that would have to be checked. However, as we know nothing about what long-term effects the dispersed material may have, there may be some surprises in store for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about landmines. What we have to know about landmines that some 230 million of them are currently stored in a number of countries. Between 70 and 100 million of them have been laid around the world. It is unfortunate, moreover, that new ones are being laid all the time, so that great significance attaches to the issue of how we locate these landmines and destroy them, primarily in human terms – that is, about ensuring that people do not get hurt in the process – but also in economic terms – that is, about keeping costs down. I would like to encourage the Commission to make the right use of the funds that we have inserted in the Budget for research purposes. In recent years, we have kept on adding funds to the research framework programme for the purpose of researching new technologies for locating landmines, so they should be used for that purpose. Progress has been made, and for that I want to express my gratitude, but these things are extraordinarily complex, and I would like again to encourage you to help, perhaps by developing some sort of multifunctional location device.</p>
<p class="contents">For my final comment, I turn to disarmament. There are other things – weapons of mass destruction, for example – that have to be disposed of. Every year, our Budget allocates some EUR 100 million to the disposal of chemical, biological and atomic weapons in the countries that formerly made up the Soviet Union. I would like you to submit a report on this, and for us to have a debate on it or produce a statement on the subject. After all, a great deal of money is involved and this is, above all, very much a live issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only do they not discriminate between the military and innocent civilians, but after years of war they are still claiming victims among the population. These weapons must be taken out of the arsenals for good. Unlike cluster bombs, there is an international ban on landmines. It is in part thanks to the European Union that the use and production of landmines is decreasing, trade in landmines has been stopped and that there are fewer victims. However, as long as non-state actors are excluded from the banning process, there cannot be a world free of landmines.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that the European Union also targets these groups with its policy and puts the topic on the agenda for the next meeting on the Ottawa Convention. Based on its experiences with landmines, it is good that the European Commission is now also developing strategies and programmes for unexploded ammunition from wars. These new activities must not, however, be carried out at the expense of the campaign against landmines; extra money must be made available for this. Many people also think that weapons containing depleted uranium also pose a risk to public health. The Commissioner referred to research that says that actually there is no reason for this concern but I share the doubts of a number of my colleagues as to whether this is enough to justify coming to the conclusion that we can simply carry on using these weapons. I am not reassured on that point yet. No matter, it is high time that we opened our eyes to the cluster bombs and that we finally woke up from our nightmare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is tendentious to quote the Euratom Commission which exists explicitly to promote nuclear technology and whose radiation safety levels were originally set to allow atmospheric testing in the 1950s. Thankfully we have done away with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Their anger is justified and is rising at the moment, because even low levels of alpha radiation can have a severe effect on children. We know from testing that there are molecules of plutonium in these weapons that are isolated but can have an extremely severe effect when ingested. Samples from six civilians near bombing targets in Afghanistan tested 100 times the normal level of uranium - contamination that stemmed from depleted uranium. Afghan doctors have cited deaths from internal ailments such as haemorrhaging, pulmonary constriction and vomiting, which are all effects of radiation contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Gulf War, allied troops admitted using over 300 tonnes of depleted uranium. These are suspected to be a prime factor in the epidemic of birth defects, leukaemias and cancers in Iraq. There is a difference between wet ground such as in Bosnia and desert conditions such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is extremely serious. I beg you not to have these children's deaths on your conscience, Commissioner, but to react more humanly and more seriously to this really dreadful situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is war without violation of human rights possible? For the combatants there is always the dilemma that showing too much respect for rights and obligations can lead to defeat, especially if you doubt the other party’s respect for the principles of combat. These truths must not undermine our support for the application of humanitarian law to warfare and its development. That is why I welcome the negotiations on the question of unexploded ammunition left over from warfare. In particular, there is a need for clarification of the responsibility for unexploded bombs that are left behind. After all, unexploded bombs and shells continue to injure many people long after the end of an armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The main role that I see for the European Commission is that of coordinating, informing and where necessary supporting Member States. Accumulation of powers tends to lead to confusion rather than to practical help for the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand the tension between justice and reality should make us cautious. Our respect for international treaties must not be allowed to degenerate into misuse of this field of the law for political purposes. After all, facile censure ultimately undermines the support for the principles of combat. That is why I do not support the amendments of the Greens. They confine themselves to one-sided criticism of one single nation while the conduct of many countries is extremely dubious in the light of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is something of an emotional muddle and manages to confuse three unrelated elements: anti-tank mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions. It fails to comprehend the nature of the work being done by the group of governmental experts on explosive remnants of war – a sensible body which is mindful of the need for the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military utility in regard to certain weapons. The armed forces of our nations, and those of our NATO allies, are the most conscious of the need to protect civilian populations, avoid collateral damage and ensure that dangers to our own troops are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">On landmines, I am proud to have been actively involved in the work to ban anti-personnel landmines and to have been instrumental in helping large-scale funding for assistance to mine victims and for mine clearance operations. I congratulate the Commission in its continuing work in this area. Our armed forces agreed that they could operate without anti-personnel landmines. Anti-vehicle or anti-tank mines are a different matter. Their humanitarian consequences are altogether less significant, and they are an indispensable military weapon as long as there are tanks on the battle field. Unexploded ordnance is a problem in post-conflict situations and more work needs to be done on self-destruction and detection of munitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The very words 'depleted uranium' conjure up all sorts of fears and ideas related to radiation which seem to be wholly misplaced. It is recognised that there could be a small risk from toxic dust for those working unprotected in close proximity to a vehicle hit by depleted uranium ammunition. While I keep an open mind, there is currently no reliable medical evidence to link depleted uranium with ill health, either of troops or of local people.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is not really about any of these things. It is wild scaremongering. It calls for an immediate moratorium on munitions which are key weapons for use by coalition airforces and armoured forces currently deploying to the Gulf. It is no coincidence perhaps that it follows an Iraqi proposition in the UN last October which sought to designate depleted uranium as a weapon of mass destruction. This ruse was heavily defeated in the United Nations, only to reappear now in the European Parliament. I hope that Members of this House will be very discriminating when they come to vote on the resolution tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are on the eve of a war which we seem likely to wage on the basis of a mere suspicion: the suspicion that there may be chemical weapons. I am concerned and astonished at the ease with which our suspicions – the suspicion that depleted uranium might have been used in a number of conflicts and that it might have had serious effects on civilians’ health – are being dispelled.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention just three facts. Firstly, Nato has not banned depleted uranium weapons, and the fact that it has not banned them leads us to fear, to believe that they have been used, that they might even have been used more than once. Secondly, a statement by the US Secretary of State for Defence in January last year referred to an increase in radiation emissions from depleted uranium weapons in Afghanistan. Thirdly, a number of medical tests carried out – under very difficult conditions because of the situation – in Afghanistan by a Canadian NGO found depleted uranium levels a hundred times as high as usual, due – it is extremely likely – to the use of depleted uranium weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in the light of all this, it would seem to be too easy, too hasty to claim that we do not have enough information to be able to presume to raise our voice and call for these weapons not to be used in any conflict and, in particular, to call for the danger of such weapons being used in Iraq to be avoided. This is the essence of our resolution but, tomorrow, it will be the responsibility of the Council and the Commission not just not to exclude the possibility of this danger being fully prevented once and for all but to demand it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Basra we were shown the most harrowing images of children who were born with the most terrible birth malformities as a result of the radiation from the last Gulf War, when allied forces used depleted uranium warheads.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish Tony Blair and George Bush had been at that hospital. If they had, perhaps they would stop saying that this illegal and immoral war they are about to unleash on Iraq is somehow in the interests of the Iraqi people. The people of Iraq are still paying the price of the last war in cancers, leukaemias and deaths. I wish Commissioner Byrne had been at that hospital too. The facts are there. If the methodologies cited by him cannot explain them, then I would suggest that his methodologies are wrong. Indeed, increasing numbers of scientists are demonstrating that the impact of low-level radiation has been consistently underestimated. There are weaknesses in those methodologies. They are not right methodologies. By denying that, we do the people of Iraq a double disservice and the deaths go on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue, as I indicated earlier, has been considered not just by the Commission, and not just by the Council of Ministers, but also by Parliament. As I mentioned earlier, the STOA report of May 2001 concluded, among other things, that in the light of the epidemiological studies on persons exposed to depleted uranium in Iraq and the Balkans, among a relatively small group of soldiers, who evidently had been exposed to depleted uranium during the Gulf War, no health problems attributable to depleted uranium could be found. Among the British Gulf War veterans neither the overall death rate nor the occurrence of specific causes of death, such as cancer, are significantly different from those of a reference population. No association between the health problems of many Gulf War veterans, that is Gulf War Syndrome, and suspected depleted uranium exposure could be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of German Kfor soldiers in Kosovo potentially exposed to depleted uranium, it could be demonstrated that no significant intake had occurred. Preliminary results of a medical expertise show that the incidence of leukaemia among the Italian Kfor troops is not significantly higher than the incidence in a reference population.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, it can be concluded that, so far, there is no scientific evidence of health damage among army personnel or civilian populations as a consequence of the use of DU ammunition in the Gulf War or the war in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Controversial information and reports about the dramatic health effects of DU among soldiers of the Iraqi and Yugoslav armies, and among the civilian population in the area concerned, do not withstand a peer review. The Commission came to exactly the same view when it considered these issues and studies, as did the Council. The STOA report went on to say that 'having comprehensively reviewed and cross-examined most of the specialised scientific literature, in particular the medical literature, judged reliable and trustworthy. Having in mind the results provided by the medical observation over decades of workers in the uranium industry, as well as by the experiments with animals. Taking into account the results of the recent investigations in Iraq and in the Balkans, of the effect on man and on the environment following the use of DU', the use of DU ammunition in Iraq and the Balkans 'neither has led to a serious widespread contamination of the environment nor represents an acute or appreciable long-term hazard for man's health'.</p>
<p class="contents">It then it goes on to give a number of recommendations, none of which coincide with the views that have been expressed by the largely Green Members of Parliament who have spoken here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say that having regard to all of these scientific studies, the seriousness and comprehensiveness of the work that has been undertaken –including by representatives of this House, the Council and the Commission – it seems to me that those who have adopted the approach we have taken must – I say this in response to Mrs Ahern – have a clear conscience. The same, I suspect, cannot be said of those who make allegations that are unfounded against people who are doing their best to provide proper answers to these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
