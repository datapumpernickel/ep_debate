<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, during our previous debates, we agreed that the financial and economic crisis can only be overcome if we combine financial stability and fiscal consolidation with measures that generate growth and jobs. The economic situation in Europe does not allow for any complacency, and we must continue to take the necessary steps not just to ensure stability but to build sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to formally present to you today – immediately after their adoption by the Commission – two concrete initiatives which address issues which we have discussed at length and where we are in agreement that significant measures need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as part of the effort to tackle the single biggest social challenge which we face, the Commission yesterday adopted an employment package. I have previously reported to this House on some of the targeted measures we are taking, such as support for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Youth Employment Initiative and the Commission action teams, which are working in Member States facing a more acute situation in terms of youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication adopted by the Commission today takes an even broader, structural perspective. Creating jobs across Europe and meeting the Europe 2020 employment target requires the concerted efforts of all actors. The communication therefore puts forward a range of actions at all levels. These include proposals to maximise the job-creating effects of the European Union budgetary instruments and policy guidance on supporting job creation, especially in areas with great potential such as the green economy, health care and the ICT sector. These are just a number of labour market reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of the communication is also a desire to remove obstacles to a genuine internal European labour market. Creating such a market will require action from national governments but also – and I will insist on this – the full involvement of the social partners at European and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">While the communication can take us a long way towards reinforcing the conditions for job creation, implementation on the ground is very much in the hands of the Member States. I would urge the Member States to move forward quickly and take the necessary steps at national level to help foster such conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second communication we have just adopted is about growth for Greece. Again, we are all in agreement on the need both to ensure that Greece delivers on its commitments and to support Greece and its people. The great efforts made by the Greek authorities and the Greek people in recent months in taking the measures necessary to secure the second programme open the way for this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The set of priority actions it proposes ranges from promoting youth employment to tax reform, from investing in education to smart regulation. These actions, if properly implemented, should quickly unblock growth, create jobs and mitigate the social impact of the crisis. Beyond this, with the determination on the side of all the Greeks and the full support of the European Union, we can transform Greece for the better. I would like to tell the Greek people that we shall succeed together.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many calls for greater solidarity, for a kind of Marshall Plan for Greece. Let us recall that the assistance provided under the Marshall Plan amounted to around 2.1% of the GDP of the recipients. The total package of assistance to Greece, if we consider the funds, grants from the Structural Funds, the loans and the write-off of private debt, is equivalent to 177% of Greek GDP. Yes, almost twice the growth Greece can generate in one year. This is a very visible symbol of the solidarity which lies at the heart of the Union. This shows that we are acting and making an enormous effort to help Greece stand on its own feet. We will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we have learned from the past. We cannot have growth mainly fuelled by debt or imbalanced growth where one sector expands to the detriment of others. Growth has to be built on the foundation of competitiveness. It should be socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Let me give some examples of how we are moving the growth agenda forward in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the single market: further releasing the full potential of the single market. This is probably the largest engine for growth in the European Union. It gives European business unfettered access to other companies and half a billion consumers and allows them to develop the scale to compete globally. Getting the most out of a properly functioning single market is indeed economic policy <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. This is why the Commission has been working for the past two years to put an enhanced single market at the service of the Europe 2020 objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is incomprehensible that Member States are still not fully implementing the growth-friendly legislation we already have in place. Full implementation of the Service Directive will produce immediate results and boost the European economy by 1.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market infringement rate in Europe is still too high. Again, if Member States are ready to move, this can deliver results fast. The Commission will present a range of ideas for improving single market governance and filling the implementation gap ahead of the June European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also need to continue our work to further enhance the single market, and indeed to complete the single market. The Commission, as you know, has presented the Single Market Act, and I again urge Member States and this House to play a constructive role in ensuring that the laws are adopted and come into force quickly. This is the only way for our SMEs and for our consumers to enjoy the full benefit of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm to you that later this year, the Commission will put forward the Single Market Act II to further advance our efforts to unleash the full job and growth potential of the single market. At the same time, we are working hard on achieving the digital single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is – and it is important to be reminded of this – the international dimension of growth. Our external policies need to focus on access to those markets in the world that are growing faster. We now have a free trade agreement with Korea which stands to bring us EUR 18 billion in additional trade, and similar agreements are being negotiated with a number of strategic partners, including India.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us not stop there. The United States is our largest economic partner. Our trade relations are the most extensive in the world, with a value of almost EUR 450 billion in 2011, and we have invested over EUR 1 trillion in each other’s economies. Any further gains, including by reducing non-tariff barriers, will be significant for both sides. We are exploring ways in which to broaden and deepen these ties.</p>
<p class="contents">In the global economy, the size of your market and the strength of your currency will determine your ability to compete, your capacity to shape the global economy and also your future prosperity. There is no strong economy without a strong currency. There cannot be a strong Europe without a strong euro. It is therefore no surprise that those who oppose a strong Europe also do whatever they can to undermine the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Europe 2020 strategy has a breadth of vision and a depth of substance which goes far beyond any one narrow perspective or single course of action. It also has the flexibility to adapt and throw up new ideas and, indeed, be the basis for a new European initiative for growth. In this respect, investment is key. Investment at European level is vital, especially at a time when there is little fiscal space at national level. Of course, the multiannual financial framework is one of the main tools for delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It is a tool for investment, growth and job creation across the whole European Union, from our capitals to our most deprived regions.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us make it clear that we are for investment and for growth. That is why we need the MFF, and that is why we need, in some cases, to frontload some of the investments. By investing in infrastructure, networks and research on a European scale, the European Union channels resources that help to complete our internal market, increase our efficiency and support the sustainability of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, to boost growth, some of the investments must be frontloaded. This is why the Commission has proposed pilot project bonds, which the European Council agreed in principle in March and which I would like to see on the ground as soon as possible. It is also why today, I would like to recall that, as I have already mentioned in this House – on 28 September 2011, in the State of the Union address, to be precise – I am in favour – and the Commission is in favour – of an increase in the capital of the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with our proposals for a financial transaction tax to contribute to the budget, we are also making clear that this budget is not only a budget for investment but for solidarity. It is also a question of fairness, and fairness is important for the support of the reforms that are needed in Europe. Our strategy must ensure a fair spread of the benefits and burdens which reform will bring. It must be inclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">The current crisis has thrown into sharp relief the question of social cohesion. The Commission and I do not believe that the European social model is dead. We believe that it is an essential part of our social market economy. At the same time, the crisis we face is not just a fiscal debt crisis, it is also a crisis of competitiveness. It is an economic crisis. In order to sustain our social model, we need not just to pursue fiscal consolidation but also to regain our competitiveness, which is key to sustaining our social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also tell you very frankly that I do not understand how it is possible that, at this especially difficult moment for Europe – while we have in some countries and many regions a real social emergency and an increase in social difficulties and, in some cases, in poverty – some governments in Europe are now calling for cuts in European programmes such as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and support for the very poorest in our societies. As I have said before, discipline must be accompanied by convergence and responsibility matched by solidarity. I can see that we are not doing enough in terms of solidarity at European level. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must show our resolve against criticism of our exit strategy by those whose goals are not always in the interests of the European Union and the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show our confidence in those who are driving efforts as we reform our economies and put our public finances in order. These reforms are important. These efforts are essential. We need to move on from practices that have been very successful for a few but have come at a great cost for many others, in particular, the most vulnerable in our societies. We must not give in to the temptation to kick-start our economies through budgetary stimulus as this would create a false sense of sustainable growth. This would be returning to past mistakes with their own set of consequences, which we have been suffering for years.</p>
<p class="contents">We must complete the reform of the financial sector and, in this regard, the Commission has already presented proposals to banish the spectre of speculation which could create new risks, so that this sector fully regains its core purpose, that of serving the real economy and covering existing economic risks.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to sustainable growth and create jobs, we must stay the course we have set ourselves. We must spare no effort in implementing elements of last October’s road map, which is our exit strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember that one of the pillars of the road map in question is to strengthen the firewall around the euro area. We now have an agreement that will strengthen the mechanisms in place to support Member States in financial difficulty and which will embark upon both vital yet difficult reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you that the European Stability Mechanism will have EUR 620 billion of callable capital, more than any other international financial institution. Its capacity of EUR 500 billion is almost equivalent to that of the International Monetary Fund, which deals with the entire world. What is more, we should remember – because there is a tendency to forget – that the Member States of the European Union are by far the main contributors to the International Monetary Fund. However, there is no room for complacency. Both the Commission and I remain convinced that the key to effective budgetary discipline and convergence in the euro area lies in the pooling of public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, work on the European Semester continues. For the first time, this year we will have an integrated vision of the situation of Member States, in particular, with the inclusion of the mechanism for the correction of macro-economic imbalances. Member States are in the process of submitting their national reform programmes and updates of their stability or convergence programmes. In May, the Commission will present its country specific recommendations based on its analysis of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that the Commission will be taking this work seriously and adopting a truly integrated approach. Thanks also to you, we now have the instruments for this kind of exercise, something we did not have in the past. For the purposes of competitiveness and inclusive and sustainable growth, the Commission will not hesitate to put Member States before their own responsibilities to ensure the reforms are put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is clearly still difficult. National authorities and our citizens are clearly making considerable efforts, yet we have some positive examples showing that these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, Latvia is living proof that implementing a demanding programme of fiscal consolidation and renewed growth is possible. We have also seen early signs of a boost in exports in Ireland and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are indeed great difficulties, but there is also some progress. We need to build on this progress. Our work will not be easy. My message has never been one of complacency. I have never said that the crisis was behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be relentless and serious in continuing our work together, showing coherence, sustainability, persistence and determination. We realise that it is a long drawn-out process with no magic solution, a process to ensure the future of our social market economy, a process to ensure the role of Europe in the world and to meet the needs and wishes of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the Europe that we want. That is the Europe that we are fighting for.</p>

What we did was necessary, because in 2008 and last autumn, we were on the brink of disaster and we almost lost everything: the euro, our financial system, but, above all, our credibility in the world and our social model.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the instruments for greater discipline. We needed to do all of this so that Europe could regain its credibility. We needed to do all of this to create the conditions for a return to growth. Growth which, being the only way to get us out of crisis, must be at the heart of our debates, starting with this afternoon’s. We cannot achieve growth by passing laws, but what we can do is create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth. How so?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by focusing on European policies for growth and employment and putting others on hold. This means acting quickly to conduct a qualitative audit of European public expenditure so that we can make informed decisions. The EU budget must be one of the key instruments for kick-starting the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, having done it with fiscal discipline, I propose a joint initiative committing us to growth, an initiative that would make the EU budget a reserve for investment for all of us. The growth principle needs to be the equivalent of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle would mean that each proposal, each EU policy would, in future, have to demonstrate how it contributes to growth. No potential for growth, no money. That should be our rule for the next two years. This principle would mean that we could, for example, examine the issue of trade agreements. Are we gaining market shares or are we losing them? Are we gaining jobs or are we losing them?</p>
<p class="contents">Another point close to my heart, as you know, is the single market. Twenty years after its launch, as I have already said and I will go on saying, we have a duty to achieve it fully. Our 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises need it, because unlike the major players, they cannot adapt to the competitiveness gaps that still exist today. We therefore have to do it for our SMEs, the very ones who, over the past decade, have created 85% of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Business leaders are now being accused of being rich. Did you know that, like me, these bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises earn at most just EUR 1 000 to 1 200 and are looking for contracts that will guarantee employment to the workers of their SMEs. Here, too, Mr Barroso, we need to support them so that the banks offer finance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead, they are dropping them, and that is not right. We need to establish a more effective support. We need to adopt a much stricter approach in order to maintain support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These are jobs that exist and we do not want to lose them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the completion of the single market, let me add another point: we need to reduce paperwork and red tape which, alone, costs our economy nearly EUR 40 billion. We need to simplify matters in order to move on.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the growth we need to kick-start our economy is not the growth of the future. What we need, right now, is to rapidly increase the added value that these companies bring. What we need is productivity gains in public services. What we need is an employment policy adapted to the new situation and I welcome the proposals adopted by the Commission this morning in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The markets have already shown renewed confidence in the Union. This confidence will remain thanks to the unprecedented discipline and solidarity of Europeans. Such solidarity was inconceivable just two years ago. I also welcome the Commission’s plan for putting the Greek economy and its public finances back on a sustainable path and for guaranteeing financial stability in that country and in the euro area as a whole. It is now up to our Greek friends, whose courage I commend, to stay the course, before and after the upcoming elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must make the most of this new impetus to step up a gear and urgently refocus the EU’s action and budget on real growth. I would like to thank the Commission – José Manuel and his team – for their work, which is no mean feat, and I also call on the Member States to move up a gear as they are the ones with deficits. It is now time for them to move back up into top gear to restore growth and jobs.</p>

I did not understand the question but I will give you an answer anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyhow, my dear friend, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is responsible for what is happening in the various countries as we shoulder our responsibility. If we have made mistakes, then we need to accept where we went wrong. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second, I do not understand what you are saying about my group. We voted for the ‘six-pack’, that was the first point. We are currently preparing the ‘two-pack’, and I do hope it will be based on the growth and employment model favoured by you.</p>
<p class="contents">As I way saying … I do not really know what you were driving at … I am also a company director working on a voluntary basis to manage my company employing just 160 people. I do not get a penny from it. We have faced difficulties four or five times now and, each time, with the help of my employees, we have managed to get ourselves out of trouble. However, we are not yet out of the crisis and that is why I maintain that it is vital that we keep the jobs we have and create new ones.</p>

That is a different issue, however.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, I listened to what you said very carefully. I can support much of what you have said. However, I ask myself whether that is really what the Commission is doing. When I look at what is being demanded in the Troika, for example – sorry to come back to that – I see that far too short a deadline is still being demanded for balancing budgets. How do you answer Mr Rajoy when he quite rightly points out that he cannot meet this deadline? What do you say to Ms Lagarde, what do you tell Mr Zoellick, when they point out that the policy of budget balancing that is being pursued is far too narrow and short-sighted?</p>
<p class="contents">Just as before, the Commission is still calling for more flexibility and less security in many countries. That is a misunderstanding of the concept of flexicurity: less security and more flexibility. Moreover, just as before, it is believed that the solution lies in marginalising unions and workers, rather than ensuring that they also take responsibility. What we want is a genuine growth strategy. However, President Barroso, if you say ‘Well, that is subsidiarity’, then I would counter that subsidiarity applies to the budget, too. Even you cannot resolve the budget problems, yet you are pushing for us to have common legislation. Why is it that when it comes to employment policy, we only get declarations, wishes and requests? Yet for the budget we have strict laws, obligations and sanctions. That is not a balanced situation, and we cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a genuine growth policy. That is what we are calling for. If Mr Sarkozy points out to his challenger François Hollande that writing the word ‘growth’ in a treaty is not enough in order to achieve it, why should he then need a treaty for fiscal union? Why has he not already been pursuing a growth policy for a long time? It is entirely possible to do so. I have greater confidence in the Financial Times, which says <span class="italic">‘It is encouraging that an increasing number of politicians, including François Hollande, the French presidential hopeful candidate, are calling for a European growth strategy’</span>. As this proves, where growth is concerned, the Financial Times is more progressive than Mr Sarkozy. I have already mentioned what Mr Zoellick said recently and what Ms Lagarde said at yesterday’s presentation. We are demanding a great deal from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, we are not prepared to pursue a policy that allows the IMF to support us appropriately. Ms Lagarde is calling for lasting fiscal initiatives that provide sufficient room to stimulate growth.</p>
<p class="contents">If you therefore present an employment package, if you present a growth strategy that we can support, then you must also tell your colleagues who go out into the countries and look at their budgetary policy that a budget policy that allows growth is also to be practised there. That is also something that I demand of the Commission: a budget policy that allows growth. That is the only way we will really achieve growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Draghi is not here, but naturally, this is also related to the European Central Bank (ECB). Much of what the ECB is doing, it is actually doing without appropriate support from policy, although the European Central Bank is, of course, also tasked with supporting the general economic policy of the EU. Many of those who criticise the ECB tend to overlook that fact. It is therefore not necessarily the case that rules need to be changed beforehand. I having nothing against our changing the rules in the way proposed by Mr Sarkozy. However, we have to conduct a growth policy that corresponds to what the ECB is trying to achieve as a support vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, I do not deny that there are also a few positive proposals. You have stuck your neck out where the financial transaction tax is concerned. On that front, we are still waiting for the Council, Mr Daul, and for the members of the governments, who are still extremely hesitant. You have now presented an employment package. It contains lots of approaches. Some of it is too ambivalent for us; some of it has not been expressed in sufficiently clear terms. Anyone who reads the statistics clearly, however, will see that the countries that are successful have not achieved that success by getting rid of social security and the influence of the unions; on the contrary. You only have to look at Germany and my own country, Austria, which is also giving the lie once again to the idea that we absolutely have to reduce social security and that more flexibility and less social security is a growth strategy. That is not a growth strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what you said regarding the European capital markets, that we can borrow money. I very much support what you said regarding the European Investment Bank, which could have started doing more a long time ago. Yet the problem remains that we are doing too little to counter unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular. President Barroso, it is not simply an economic issue. You know that very well. It is also a social issue and, in the final event, a political issue. How are we supposed to save political democracy in Europe when so many people – so many young people – are unemployed and giving up hope? If they despair of this Europe and despair of democracy in Europe, then eventually it leads to their electing extremist parties. That is the great challenge that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">To quote Mr Zoellick once more, ‘show people who want to work that you want them to work’. That is our job, and that is what we must do. Otherwise, I fear that we will be on a similar course to the Titanic. If we want to avoid heading for an economic, political and social iceberg, then it is essential that what is in the employment package is transformed into actual legislation. Declarations are not enough. We need strong, binding legislation in the area of employment policy too.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span>– Mr President, so, Mr Barroso, it is just one month ago that we had our last debate on the euro crisis here. It was on 13 March, and you remember what happened. Statements were made to the effect that the crisis was over, that we had reached a turning point, that the worst was behind us – statements not made by you, I have to recognise and underline that; the Commission did not do that, but statements by Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Draghi, Mr Jünker, and also by Mr Sarkozy (but for quite obvious other reasons).</p>
<p class="contents">What I deplore is that none of all these people is here today, when we invited them to come to this Parliament. Mr Draghi is not here, and Mr Jünker had no time; the Council is also not here – there are a number of civil servants, but the Council is not here. In the middle of a euro crisis, when they were stating a month ago that everything was done and the worst was behind us, they do not have the courage to be here. It is a lack of courage that I want to deplore today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the real thing is that we all know that the crisis is not over. We said it here one month ago, on 13 March. We introduced austerity; we have established emergency funds; we have injected one trillion euro into the banking system; we have bought more than EUR 100 billion of sovereign debt from countries like Portugal, Ireland and Italy; we have decided on the biggest haircut in the history of the world (what happened with the Greek debt is the biggest haircut ever carried out) – and what is the result? The result is that interest rates in Spain and Italy today are back where they were six months ago, at around 6%; the spreads are again around 400 basic points for countries like Italy and Spain, and these spreads are also going up for other countries in the eurozone – mainly for France, Belgium and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So one thing is clear: we need another approach. We need a structural approach, not the half measures we have seen for two years now. In my opinion, this means two things: first of all, we must launch a new growth strategy (a real one), using the EIB as you have indicated, and spend money from the EU budget – project bonds, not only a pilot project, but project bonds on a full scale. My proposal is that you put forward to the Council and Parliament a global plan on this – on a new growth strategy – as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing, as we know, is partial mutualisation of debt. You have talked, as everybody here does, about strengthening solidarity without losing discipline. There is only one good proposal: the redemption fund, a EUR 2.3 trillion fund which will help all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody knows that this is the only way forward. What is important to underline is that, in the case of a redemption fund, it is the bondholders who are paying the bill by receiving lower interest rates, not the taxpayers of Germany or the other countries. Perhaps we should launch a campaign in the German press about this. Now they are paying the bill with the so-called fire extinguisher – the rescue fund – while, with a structural solution of a redemption fund, it would be the bondholders paying.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally to Greece, and I am very pleased with the announcement today. However, last week, I sent you a letter about Greece, which was also about the financing of the political parties. The two main political parties in Greece – both irresponsibly in my opinion, given the current situation – paid themselves EUR 29 million of taxpayers’ money to start the campaign on 6 May. The Commission spokesman responded in a press conference by saying that it was none of the Commission’s business.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with you. You interfere in pensions and in wages in Greece – this is not foreseen in the Treaty, but you do it, and I think it is necessary to do so. In the second memorandum of understanding, it is clearly stated that there must be a reduction – and I quote (I have here the MOU No 2) – ‘of the electoral spending of EUR 70 million in Greece’.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, based on that memorandum, you can interfere. I find it a scandal – and this is my final word – that Greek citizens have to make sacrifices and that the European partners have to continue to pay while most Greek politicians simply continue the bad practices of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rebecca Harms, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, although Mr Draghi has declined to attend, I would like to reiterate that I think it would have been very good to have him here. I thought it was a very good idea of the Conference of Presidents, because I think it is high time we had a direct face-to-face discussion between us here concerning whether the strategies of the European Central Bank are consistent and proportionate with the common European crisis strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, we have praised the ECB on several occasions for having saved by its measures not just the euro, but in some situations, probably the entire European Union, from a worse fate. However, have we actually dealt carefully enough, in political terms, with the actions taken by the European Central Bank? Has the Council used the time bought well? Thousands of billions of euro have flowed into European banks under Mr Draghi. What was supposed to be done with this money? This money was supposed to be used for the real economy, and it was supposed to be used to buy up government bonds in the crisis-hit countries. My findings suggest that only a small part of it has been used for this. Why is that? My findings suggest that the time bought by the ECB to enable us to make better policies in Europe has not only elapsed without being utilised, but has actually been used counterproductively. All the palaver over the European fiscal pact, which was played out splendidly all over again at the last summit, has meant that we have not utilised the time bought properly – time that cost thousands of billions of euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The dramatic reports from Southern Europe – and we are no longer talking only about little Greece and Portugal, but now we are also talking about large countries, large economies such as Spain and Italy – make me think that what we are hearing from there suggests we cannot afford to go down this single-minded, fanatical road of austerity any further. I welcome the programme that is now being put forward by you and Commissioner Andor, but before I give you any further praise for it, I must reiterate that some of the demands that we have repeated like a mantra over the past year have not yet been dealt with. In this respect, I share Mr Verhofstadt’s opinion that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) must be expanded. We do not have sufficient funding in the ESM. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), or even the ESM, needs a banking licence. We need to be able to intervene differently in the markets, and we cannot allow ourselves to continue along this path of austerity. If government debt is not the sole cause of the crisis, then austerity alone cannot be the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the programme that you have presented today, I would like to say that we have long been convinced that we need to conduct anti-recession policies, that we need to stimulate lasting growth. Whether you will manage to do it – that I do not know, Mr Barroso. I no longer know what the European Commission is capable of here. I would be very interested to know, for example, what timetable you are actually following right now – so that, on behalf of my group, I can judge whether anything will actually be done in time in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal and in other crisis-hit countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the sugar has worn off and the hangover is well and truly kicking in – and, unsurprisingly, we discover that the eurozone faces all the same problems that it faced beforehand. Solutions will only be identified when our leaders finally decide to put the economics ahead of the politics and hard-headed realism ahead of financial federalist romanticism.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, fortunately, represents predominantly non-euro nations, so I feel best placed to offer some impartial, honest and realistic advice. It is all part of the service that we offer, Guy. As I see it, there are two rational options. Either, firstly, Germany and some of the other Northern European States accept that they are going to have to enter into a full-scale fiscal transfer union with permanent flows of money – not just loans – from Northern Europe to Southern Europe, or, alternatively, we allow the lightning rod of this crisis – which has become the poor people of Greece – the opportunity to leave the euro and to devalue their way back into the marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand why German taxpayers and Dutch taxpayers and others are rather reticent about allowing their hard-earned taxes to flow to a number of unreformed countries. Similarly, I can sympathise with the poor Greeks, who are reluctant to hand over any more of their economic sovereignty. That leaves us only with the option that Greece should be allowed to leave the eurozone, to default and to devalue.</p>
<p class="contents">A 10-year-old child could work that out. In fact, a 10-year-old child did work that out. I have here a Wolfson Prize essay from Jurre Hermans, who is a 10-year-old from the Netherlands, and it sets out a plan for how Greece can leave the euro. He won a prize for it. I particularly like the picture that he drew illustrating how all this would successfully work. In his essay, Jurre says ‘I think about solutions’ – which, I have to say, is more than can be said for some of the euro’s leaders. Instead of solutions, what we have seen is finger pointing, and I agree with Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy that it is not right for others – most notably the electioneering Nicholas Sarkozy – to point fingers in the direction of Spain. Instead, it is time for the euro leaders to make a decision. The choices are simple: either Germany and Northern Europe pays, or Greece leaves, or the euro fails. The choice seems obvious to me; it seems obvious to 10-year-old Jurre. I am just sorry that it does not seem so obvious to some of our eurozone leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we have a more realistic Mr Barroso, who says that if we follow his policies and stick together, we can solve this in the end. Sorry, no one believes you anymore, and actually, in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation, these comments look ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain, mass unemployment gathers by the day, and internal democracy in Spain is now under threat. In Italy – where we were told Mr Monti would sort it all out – growth figures are falling and the bond spreads are worsening. Now an IMF official has come out and said that it is obvious that at some point a euro break-up will happen. These are big changes: the euro is doomed, and with your policies, Sir – even if Greece accepts the austerity you are imposing on them, and even if, for the next eight years, they obey all this – in 2020, they will still have a debt GDP ratio of 120%, which makes one ask: what is the point?</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain: if Spain was able to increase ... the difference is, Sir, Britain is not trapped inside the economic prison of the euro. Now take this: if Spain was to increase, if she increased her productivity growth by half a per cent a year (which at the moment looks unlikely), it would take her forty years to close the competitiveness gap with Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries were sucked in to a totally false economic boom with artificially low interest rates, and they are now paying the price. These policies cannot succeed. Mercifully, outside of this institution, economists the world over now say it is inevitable that the euro will break up; it is just a question of how. I really hope that the IMF now decides to stop pouring good money after bad into these bailouts, and I really do hope that not one penny piece more of British taxpayers’ money goes into propping something up that should be allowed to die. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither does it bring up children, and it cannot provide children with a life in unspoilt nature. This would suggest that the Commission, and also the Council, needs to rethink its priorities; needs to reconsider. As a group, we will examine very carefully whether what you presented earlier today actually represents a shift in priorities. Until now, the motto has been to deal first with the economy, which needs functioning financial markets. That is why the first task was to balance national budgets – in other words, to reduce debt and keep the markets calm.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Daul is not here now. I simply wanted to tell him that my response is exactly the same as that of Georges Marchais. I did not understand his answer, but nonetheless I would contradict him. The measures that were taken were incorrect. It was wrong to concentrate solely on getting the economy right, and in the process to disregard entirely what was happening to people. It was wrong to put the stability of the euro above all else and to say that we could not care less what became of people. It should be the other way round: we must deal first with the people, then we can talk about stabilising the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The speculative raids on Spain took interest rates on Spanish government bonds to above 6% or more, and thus close to the level at which other countries such as Greece, Portugal and even Ireland claimed assistance from the bail-out fund. The policy of austerity that has been forced on the Member States by the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) and also by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with drastic cuts in public expenditure of all kinds, from reductions in wages and pensions to increases in value-added tax and much more, has increased the burden on citizens without even preventing the recent spiral. Rigorous cuts in public expenditure are exacerbating the downturn and driving up national debt – and we all need to acknowledge that. When Mr Draghi said recently that the European social model was finished, then I would like to hear you, Mr Barroso, say that the Commission does not think so. I would also expect you to go to Greece, to send your people to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, and to take careful note of what is going on there.</p>
<p class="contents">What will happen to the people who are currently having to fight for survival? What are we jointly doing to break once and for all this vicious circle that has implanted itself precisely in the countries worst hit by the debt crisis? We simply cannot look on and do nothing. It is no use having social policy programmes that will start to have an effect sometime in the future, when other measures have already taken effect. We need to act now. What has become of your 2020 goals to eradicate poverty? What happened to the European poverty platform? It has been put on the back burner. That was before the crisis. It is now, however, in the midst of the crisis, that people need help and support – and that they need the European Union to act. They do not need empty promises. We need concrete ideas for what we can do now. If you do that, you will have the support of my group. Support all those – including those within the Commission – who have seen the signs of the times all too clearly and want to change things. Please do not simply carry on as you were and say it will happen anyway. If we carry on as we have been doing, there will be nothing left. I appeal to you to present an actual project, a programme for how we can really provide active help to the people in the countries affected right now. Do something for them. In our Member States, we need to do what is necessary to ensure that the funds for the European Stability Framework (ESF) 2013 or 2014-2020, or for the other programmes, are not blocked or cut. The Member States must shoulder their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They voted for all the texts that are largely responsible for the current situation. They voted for all the texts on free trade, all the texts that have resulted in the European Economic Area no longer being protected against fierce competition from industrialising countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the crisis is a structural crisis as everyone knows. It is essentially the result of the de-industrialisation of most of Europe or, at any rate, the loss of the virtual monopoly of industry we enjoyed until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis is also undoubtedly due financially to the increase in public spending, but this increase in public spending has long been known by another name: socialism. This is socialism indeed. A creeping socialism that has, in fact, been practised with great freedom and ease by supposedly liberal regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr Barroso, before concluding, I would, however, like to ask you one question. A debate has raged for three days in France, ahead of the first round of presidential elections, over a mysterious text entitled ‘Towards a job-rich recovery’. Journalists got access to this text. The media claims the Commissioner responsible for the matter will present it today in Strasbourg. Today maybe, in Strasbourg undoubtedly, but not, at any rate, to MEPs, unless the brief comments you just made on employment are supposed to serve this purpose. I have not seen this text. However, I have seen comments and even denials of these comments made by Commission officials. How can we back-pedal like this on such an important issue?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, even as I listened to you call for economic and financial austerity, I could not help but be reminded of US President Herbert Hoover in the 1930s, promising that prosperity was just around the corner. I am not sure that the promise he made was any more serious than the one you are making to us.</p>

However, on the other hand, it is internal socialism. It is the excesses, the abuses of the welfare state. It is the exponential growth in my country of useless expenditure by public authorities, for example, carried out in the spirit of social democracy by all successive governments, even supposedly liberal governments.

Some of those have been made in the context of important elections, in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation. Naturally, we do not welcome any of these references. Furthermore, as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems, others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in Parliament, some have failed to show any <span class="italic">finezza</span>, as the Italians would say, and there has been a lack of political tact.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the markets does not reflect Spain’s strength. We are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts. The Spanish debt remains below the European average, and the Spanish Government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda, Mr Rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the European Union. On the contrary, he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets, and he repeats that on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government, in the few months it has been in office, has adopted, and will continue to adopt, very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness, job creation and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In the outlook it made public yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the Spanish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted other measures: the general State budget for 2012, which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year; the organic law on budgetary stability; a reform of the education and health care systems, which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of EUR 10 billion; and the reform of the financial sector, which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than EUR 50 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Spain is meeting the targets set by the Commission, and we are calling on everyone to be responsible. We all need to find a way out of this together, Spain with everyone else, without a doubt; the criticisms being made are not at all helpful. Either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction, or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the Commission.</p>

In fact, employment is at the heart of any growth agenda. It is obviously important to mutualise sovereign debt. It is obviously essential to increase the European budget. It is obviously necessary to review the Greek agenda. Welcome to the debate. However, that is not what is currently in play: what we have is a completely recessive agenda; an agenda staking everything on the budgetary discipline issue and the measures being imposed on the countries with the greatest difficulties by the Troika on a daily basis. The results of this are plain to see and run completely counter to what you have brought before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Greece has lost 20% of its GDP in five years. You talk about social cohesion, but poverty is spreading throughout Europe and the state is so weakened that private charitable bodies – NGOs – are having to replace it. You talk about social consensus, but it has been completely destroyed by the power of the Troika, which has even destroyed constitutional rights, drained pensions, and ignored and destroyed social consensus. You talk about the need for the emergence of small and medium-sized enterprises, but reduced demand and the lack of credit force these companies out of business every day, causing unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what I should like to say to you, Dr Barroso, is we need to move away from these mistakes and this contradictory discourse. There are no jobs without relaunching the economy, in fact, but this involves a genuine Marshall Plan, not the support by financial assistance you mentioned, which serves only to pay interest and debt, and to renegotiate debts. A genuine Marshall Plan is a plan for growth, development and investment. Domestic demand in countries with surpluses needs to be unblocked, a European industrial policy needs to be reborn and external trade policy to be made compatible therewith, and minimum levels of public access to welfare and public services need to be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">When will we see this agenda? My second question, Dr Barroso, is when ...</p>

Recycling of panic therefore suits the smart, but we have to stay fixed on the longer term and recognise that it will not be smooth.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has put huge resources into containing the crisis, including through the IMF. Politics prevented faster action: that is regrettable, but it is a fact of life. However, with all the billions that are pledged to the rescue packages, it seems lunacy to be reining back on the EIB when the search for growth is urgent. The EIB is a fantastic means to leverage growth, and Member States should think again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also conscious that there are, and will be, unintended consequences on growth from our regulation. Deleveraging by banks, reducing SME loans in trade financing and perverse incentives to short- rather than long-term investment are already evident. It is vital to find a way to deal with this during the regulatory process and subsequently. Finally, getting out of the trillion of the LTRO looks challenging, but we should not forget that there are EUR 800 billion parked with the ECB by nervous banks.</p>
<p class="contents">I was given a minute and a half by my group. I have one sentence left. If you took that EUR 800 billion and had that invested in euro area two-year bills under common issuance, that would satisfy all significant sovereign needs.

I am delighted that today we are debating employment and growth; however, a great deal of damage has already been done and the Commission must admit that it has made a massive mistake, as has the Greek Government. What are the statistics at present? We know that unemployment in relation to the active population has passed the 21% mark and that over 1 000 000 people are unemployed. Two million people, 20% of the total population, are only just surviving and over 50% of young people have been unemployed for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to look again at the policies being applied in Greece and ensure that there is cohesion between them and our European values. We need more than mere promises and words; we also need objectives. We have included an objective to reduce the deficit, but why have we not included an objective to reduce unemployment and deal with the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises. We also need specific targets and timetables. Unilateral austerity is not the answer; the problem needs to be addressed in a fair, balanced manner, by changing the economy and the administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we do not currently have all the answers, there are already important lessons to be learned from the eurozone crisis, some of which need to be learned in my own constituency. It is clear that one of the problems identified in Spain has been the level of public debt and liabilities assumed by their regional governments, to which a clear value of the amount outstanding is only now emerging. It has left the Spanish debt market in disarray and lacking investor confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore disappointed that my own Welsh Government is currently seeking to raise new debt in the markets. Any Welsh debt would ultimately be the liability of the UK Government and would replicate the failed Spanish experiment. Under the new EU stronger economic governance and debt management regimes, surely those liable for the debt need to assume control for all monies raised, whether privately, through the EIB or, more worryingly, in the capital markets? When Member States rightly bear the ultimate responsibility for the debt and the resulting debt ratios, systems of accountability need to be ensured. I hope the Silk Commission in Wales and those that favour Eurobonds in the eurozone heed the Spanish experience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My country has made huge strides to date with the help of its partners. The deficit has been slashed and the situation is stabilising. Structural changes are proceeding. Obviously, public sector spending needs to be cut still further, so that excessive direct and indirect taxation can be restricted and growth can start.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greek New Democracy MEPs in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) pointed out the risk inherent in unilateral austerity very early on. Both we and our chair, Mr Samaras, pointed out that an austerity programme needed to be accompanied by a growth programme. Today, everyone subscribes to this truth. Some people here in this Chamber are calling for Greece to leave the euro area. That is a great pity. The Greek people wish to remain closely associated with Europe and the euro. We consider that it is only by all pulling together that we can deal with a crisis that has become systemic. The same applies to every country in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have built together, we must maintain together, in order to safeguard our joint endeavour. We must all work to combat unemployment and fight for a new period of prosperity. No country can manage that on its own. The President of the Commission knows that better than anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out, further to the comments made by the Chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Verhofstadt, that things are not exactly in keeping with what he said: the financing he spoke of was provided in previous years and Parliament simply regulated repayment to the banks. I do not think that the Greek parties are prepared to basically spend, in these difficult times, while the people are suffering from the sacrifices they are making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of what you propose – such as European Investment Bank (EIB) financed infrastructure projects – could indeed make them more competitive and thus contribute to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, much of what you say reminds me of what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is proposing – namely, taking on more debt in order to stimulate growth. At the end of the day, such additional financial injections would be just a flash in the pan, and there would be nothing to show for it afterwards other than even higher levels of debt, even higher unemployment and even higher inflation. We experienced that in Germany in the 1970s, when Helmut Schmidt tried precisely that. What we are dealing with is not a cyclical problem, but rather a structural weakness. If we are to overcome it, we need courageous structural reforms. Unfortunately, we are seeing little of that in the countries concerned. We need to complete the internal market, including the services sector. We need to open up protected markets, we need to make the labour market more flexible and we need to get rid of red tape. All that can happen without taking any more money, and it would still lead to growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU should be leading by example, but instead it is still throwing money at vanity projects. So let us stop them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to stop just talking about growth and competitiveness and take action. We have to cut bureaucracy for businesses, but instead the EU puts barriers on our businesses, costs on our consumers and impediments on our investors. Let us stop them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the economic crisis started in the financial sector. Four years on, this week, the share prices of some of Europe’s biggest banks are still tumbling. The ECB’s EUR 1 trillion sticking plaster is not working. Reforming financial services is not a political toy. Our Basel commitments are vital, but measures that force our largest services industry to relocate overseas must be stopped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The response from the euro area has been strong. We have given ourselves new stringent regulations for Member State budgets in order to avoid repeating the errors of the past, but these rules requiring major sacrifices from our citizens cover only one area.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time to focus on growth, and I agree with all those who have spoken about growth, because if we straightjacket our state budgets and also require rigorous structural reforms, then, at the same time, we have to bring in measures to stimulate growth. Otherwise, in overall terms, Europe or many Member States risk falling into recession.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem facing us today is the lack of an investment policy, the only way to avoid another crisis, which is that of economic stagnation. Therefore, this Parliament is in the frontline with these topics, such as the addition of a discount factor, and I appeal to Mr Barroso with regard to the problem of the Basel reforms – a supporting factor for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to which all the European institutions need to respond jointly and unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, we cannot avoid taking the issue of Eurobonds into account, but we must make a distinction as there is a lot of confusion in this regard. Eurobonds need to be created without resorting to mutualising the debt.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the third approach in the Green Paper seems to be the right one, but there need to be a few amendments. The European economy cannot be kick-started if we do not use the strength of the euro at the same time. Eurobonds make it possible to organise and contain public debt and to collect the necessary finances for Europe’s future on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Merkozy decision makers have, at the end of the day, only one recipe: fiscal consolidation through austerity. All the leading economists – Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Wolfgang Münchau, Thomas Piketty – tell us that the EU is currently drawing the wrong lessons from the crisis, that it has committed to – and I quote – ‘an absurd race to the bottom in social terms, towards austerity policies which shatter growth and ultimately towards the temptation to go it alone’. I have just cited the group of economists led by Philippe Aghion of Harvard.</p>
<p class="contents">The gravity of the situation calls for immediate action. Instead of dreaming about sustainable development, we should be fighting for strong growth. Thus, to revive the Greek economy, we must immediately recapitalise Greek banks. We must implement as quickly as possible the 78 projects identified by the task force which can be financed from the Structural Funds. We must finally decide to increase the European Investment Bank’s capital. We must launch project bonds.

In this regard, what is to be the role of the European Central Bank, which has shown extraordinary creativity during the financial crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">Make no mistake. It is not a matter of making some completely unrealistic revision to the treaty. It is, in reality, about creating political conditions for the ECB to take the action it has undertaken further by buying sovereign debt on the secondary market and injecting liquidity into the financial system. Experience shows that this is possible within the existing legal framework without undermining the independence of the ECB or backtracking on its objectives. It is a question of European solidarity and political will, and not of legal provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, recovery of public finances and prevention of the risk of crises remain a priority. Economic governance of the euro area is being strengthened. Mechanisms for the detection, prevention and sanction of abuses have been reinforced by the ‘six-pack’ initiative. The ‘two-pack’ initiative is under negotiation and there must be a conclusion on this subject soon. This negotiation must particularly make it possible to develop effective, practical measures for the benefit of Member States in difficulty or whose deficits are excessive. In this regard, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised as normal at European level to make the steps to be taken in this area acceptable to the people, the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by stressing that it would be desirable for the Commission’s proposal to be supplemented by legal protection for any Member State in extreme difficulty – not to encourage complacency but, on the contrary, to allow them to recover and meet their obligations. This provision should be controlled by the Commission under the supervision of the Council and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To date, the Commission has put all its weight behind fiscal austerity, thereby underestimating the economic and social consequences, the deep recession and spiralling unemployment, especially among young people. This has led to Europe being targeted and to a widespread lack of confidence among European citizens and we should be concerned by the fact that, wherever elections are being held, and I am not referring to Greece, I am referring to France, Europe is at the centre of the election campaign, but in a negative, not a positive way.</p>

Mainly, however, the responsibility has been assumed by the Greek people due to vote in three weeks and I should like to ask the Vice-President of the European Commission, based on the letters from Mr Venizelos and Mr Papademos to the Commission, to tell us what specific measures and policies it can use to help combat unemployment, especially among young people, which is close to 50%, to safeguard financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are failing, and to unblock the major projects that are crucial to growth and job creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States are spending vast sums of money. The Greeks have made serious sacrifices. However, the targets have not been met. Why? Because the adjustment fell primarily not on the state-subsidised, clientelist system, but on the productive system in Greece and on the weakest members of society: companies, salaried employees and low-paid pensioners. Over-taxation and a complete lack of financing are currently causing competitive Greek export companies to go out of business. The State has delayed payment of debts of EUR 6 billion to the private sector. The two ruling parties are taking on people in the run-up to the elections and have passed a law regulating their massive debts to the banks on favourable terms. The Commission does not appear to have any noteworthy new proposals that compare with the 2020 plan presented recently by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. This plan includes more private investment, liquidity and jobs. There is a positive, productive, creative Greece outside the inveterate, state-subsidised, clientelist system and it is high time that Europe started investing in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barroso has gone, so it is too late to ask him. The Council is not here either, so the question is superfluous. However, as you are responsible for various areas of the Commission, I can ask you: what will you actually take away from this debate with the European Parliament on an unbelievably serious issue – one that will decide the fate of our populations in the Member States? I will tell you what I am taking away from it: I have a problem. Whenever your services give you reports of how we are not making any progress because growth continues to be in decline, of how employment is in the doldrums, then you get someone to write something about employment and how it can be increased through relatively non-binding measures. I have read it all a hundred times before. Over the past twelve years, I must have read what is written here a hundred times.</p>
<p class="contents">However, those who commit this stuff to paper are sitting in your departments, Commissioner Rehn. What they actually believe is something different. They believe that we need to chase the countries of southern Europe through a structural recession. Those are the hard facts of the Stability and Growth Pact, those are the hard facts of the fiscal pact, and those are the hard facts of the erroneous expenditure policy. Until you resolve this contradiction and actually commit to paper some concrete measures for raising levels of investment again, the people will not understand you. I do not understand you either.</p>

If you actually read the data on the Netherlands, you will see that growth is in decline there too. When Germans read the statistics, they actually know very well that they are very dependent on them. Things may appear to be going better again in the south, but this is only fleeting. On no account should we think that Germany can maintain its export rates in the long term without a functioning euro area. So my answer is yes; we need to arrive at a constellation in which demand in southern Europe is also boosted again.

He has a great deal to contribute because he could use his experience to show that when the European Central Bank acts decisively, tensions over the euro lessen.</p>
<p class="contents">That tension therefore has more to do with speculators’ greed than with the foundations of the affected economies, and that includes the peripheral countries, of which Spain is a good example. This has been mentioned many times here because, when the crisis erupted, Spain did not have a problem with its public deficit, public accounts or accumulated public debt. None of these were a problem. We are far below the EU average and had even settled with a surplus in the three previous budgetary periods.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the financial crisis that brought on Spain’s financial troubles, not the other way round. The financial crisis was the cause; our debt and deficit were not the origin of Spain’s financial difficulties, which shows how important it is for the ECB to act emphatically, resolutely and decisively, to act like a firewall or a dam to prevent speculation against the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to do so, there needs to be a change of policy, which the Commission has an obligation to promote. This change of policy should not entail complying with an austerity plan that excludes all other measures and which is leading the EU into disaster; rather, the Commission should consider giving real meaning to the concepts of growth and employment.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, have you and the European Commission read that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not expect Italy to balance its budget in 2013 or very likely in 2014 either? Does this forecast stimulate any particular thoughts? I am speaking about Italy, but I could very easily be speaking about other countries. The strangest thing is that the IMF tells us, of course, that if there were no recession, Italy would have a surplus of 0.6%. That is great. However, the problem is that there is a crisis, there is a recession, and it is difficult to pretend that there is not.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rehn, in Europe, are we making choices based on an analysis of the actual situation we are experiencing, or are we simply applying a doctrine based on abstract principles? I believe that we continue to focus on objectives that are not in line with the economic cycle. Commissioner, today, we have been told about the European Commission’s plans for growth, but are you sure that growth based on supply-side policy principles is enough, without considering the at least equal importance of a policy that acts on the aggregate demand side?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I shall end with an appeal. I beg you to speak truthfully to European citizens, truthfully about the crisis and the concrete fact that we still do not have any choices to take at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, Mr Barroso said that investment is a priority for growth, so we need to go further than pilot projects and launch a real European project-bond initiative. Second, we need the European Central Bank (ECB) to be a lender of last resort, and we especially need to take on board the warnings coming from the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe that are calling for a commitment to fight the credit crunch, by means including the introduction of the SME supporting factor into the Basel review in order to support lending to businesses. We are not cutting the budget, Mr Barroso has assured us of that, because we can only work for the general good if every Member State does its bit. We should therefore eliminate some anachronistic rewards of position, such as the British rebate.</p>

As many have said – the last of whom was Mr Domenici – a fact evident to all, with the clear exception of the European institutions, has not been acknowledged. That is that we are falling from a recession into the risk of a depression, and in these circumstances, compliance with the objectives of the ‘six-pack’ and the fiscal compact is quite simply impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one solution for tackling this recessionary and depressive downward spiral and that is to revitalise demand through investment. The solutions and answers that Mr Barroso proposed cannot work by themselves. Investment is needed, and as it is not realistic to make a substantial increase in the European budget at the moment – although we have been asking for it – public investment is needed, and therefore a reform of the ‘six-pack’ that introduces the golden rule on a group of public investments, which need to be separated from the calculation of the structural deficit. This is what Europe needs today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finally, there is attention to job creation and to labour demands and to greening the economy, which I think is a highly welcome and long overdue shift of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific questions I have concern wages. Firstly, will the Commission adapt the scoreboard for macro-economic imbalances in such a way that excessive wage moderation is considered an imbalance as well? Secondly, will the Commission address country-specific recommendations to those countries without decent minimum wages?

It is sad that the topic remains relevant to this day. It would be good to know how many of the proposals put forward here will be realised. Unfortunately, there is conflicting news about the success of crisis management. It would be advisable to draw appropriate conclusions. It is important that we do not deceive ourselves when drawing these conclusions. There is one additional matter that needs to be clarified, and to me this is the most important question today. It is about the title of today’s agenda item. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us not forget that we adopted the ‘six-pack’ on economic governance, as well as strict fiscal policy together, and yet now we are just talking about the euro area. This title conveys a different meaning to me. To me, it means that the EU treats some countries as its own children, some as favoured stepchildren, and others as mere stepchildren. Commissioner, please confirm that this is not true, and that we have a common way of thinking, a common tool, and that the growth strategy will be common, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were very afraid of talking about the bad situation in Italy – it became a reality. Now news has appeared in the press about Spain and so on. As for the other European Union Member States, it is only a matter of time unless we really change our attitude to the overall global context. We care about everything, but in order to care about climate change and aid for third countries and many other things, what we need, above all, are funds. However, those funds are not enough for us. I therefore can only see one route today – we have to begin to care for the protection of our market. We have to begin to think about how to undo that injustice programmed for the future financial perspective.

The euro is the cause of Spanish woes. It allowed the real estate boom and enabled private debt to soar but, when the bubble burst, banks could not maintain liquidity and faced insolvency.</p>
<p class="contents">But, due to the euro, Spain could not print money to bail out the banks. It had to borrow in bond markets, forcing the deficit to grow rapidly. The government could not then finance aggressive stimulus spending to soften the recession. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio was smaller than Germany’s, but the European Union insisted that the government slash spending to force the deficit down. This caused growth to stagnate, unemployment to boom and private investment to stall, leading to the protracted implosion we are witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain’s banks are now entirely dependent on emergency loans from the European Central Bank. Youth unemployment is at 51%. Hundreds of thousands of people are on the streets demonstrating against the austerity which is destroying their country. Surely it is time to scrap the euro – or are you just going to issue another pointless bail-out and continue to wreck people’s lives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will respond on behalf of the Commission on some of the key questions. As we were asked what we will take from this debate, I can say that I am fully aware that Europe is living through very tough times in terms of employment and the problems of unemployment, and in terms of growth or lack of growth. This has been very clearly reflected in all the speeches in your debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">From our side, I want to underline that it would be very important to try to avoid an excessively ideological debate on fiscal consolidation. It is clear that, as seen in the past three or four years, the level of public debt in Europe has increased from around 60% to around 90% of GDP. It is hampering growth and causing problems for sustainable growth and employment. Therefore, we need a dual strategy, which we are working on. We need both fiscal consolidation and sustainable growth for the sake of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall – not least thanks to the ‘six-pack’, the new economic governance and your support for this new framework for economic governance – we are getting results as regards fiscal consolidation in the euro area and in the whole European Union, which is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. In the next few weeks, we will assess the economic and fiscal policy stance of the euro area and the Union as a whole on the basis of the latest information from Eurostat and our forthcoming spring forecast. Then it will be the right time to analyse and decide what is the best way to strike the right balance between consolidation and growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important debate for the whole euro area (not only for certain countries), and therefore we are pursuing this debate and are currently making the necessary preparations. I very much look forward to continuing this discussion with the Parliament in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need for sustainable growth? We need investment, even under the constraints of fiscal consolidation we are currently facing. Let me refer here to what the Commission proposed in the annual growth survey at the end of last year. We put forward a very investment-oriented multifinancial framework. Last year, we proposed project bonds in order to stimulate investment, and just before Easter we had a breakthrough when the Council endorsed this. I want to ensure that we can start the first concrete projects moving in the course of the coming months – this summer – in order to have investment in infrastructure, energy, transport and communication, which means sustainable employment for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank you for your very concrete support for the objective of project bonds. We have called for reinforcement of the capital base of the European Investment Bank, which is a very powerful instrument of the European Union for supporting growth and employment. But, as you know, it is reaching the limits of what it can do with its current capital base, and therefore, in order to allow the EIB to do more for growth and jobs, its capital needs must be addressed. Its capital base needs to be increased, and this should be done by its shareholders and by the EU Member States. For instance, a capital increase of EUR 10 billion would allow the EIB to lend approximately EUR 60 billion which, in turn, would attract other financing sources for a total investment of EUR 180 billion for new projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore send a very clear and constructive message to all the Member States. For the sake of sustainable growth and job creation, we need more European cross-border and Community investment in infrastructure, energy, transport, innovation, research and communication. Therefore, I call on them to provide additional capital for the EIB and on you to support this objective with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to intensify our work in employment policy. Today, my colleague, László Andor, presented to us a very comprehensive and ambitious package on employment policy covering several areas, including putting the emphasis on the urgent need to focus on efforts on the demand side of job creation. This means encouraging the Member States to take steps that create the right conditions for job creation and labour demand. The package also looks at the major structural challenges facing Europe – to which Ms Cornelissen referred in her speech – such as the move towards a low carbon and resource-efficient economy, the demographic ageing of our societies and rapid technological change. Here, we have identified the green economy, information and communication technologies and health services as the three areas that generate the most job opportunities in Europe. For instance, the green economy alone is expected to create over 20 million jobs in the next ten years, of course on the condition that we can pursue and intensify investment along the lines I described, for instance, by using the European Investment Bank as an instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">There were several questions relating to many of the Member States. I would just draw your attention to our communication today on promoting growth and jobs in Greece, which very clearly underlines that Europe stands by Greece in its efforts to reform its economy and administration. Today’s communication is about sending a strong signal that Greece can make it, together with its European partners. Greece can relaunch growth and restore its competitiveness. Greece can reform its tax system to make it more effective, fair and just. It can also reform its public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Italy and Spain, which were referred to in several speeches, I would like to underline the fact that both countries – Italy and Spain – have taken and are taking effective and determined action on fiscal consolidation as well as growth-boosting structural reforms, which, over time, will help build confidence in the economies of Italy and Spain. In this context, it is essential – indeed it is crucial – that the European partners of Italy and Spain – the Member States, the Commission, the Parliament and the other EU institutions – all support these countries and stay united behind Italy and Spain in order to help them to overcome their challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the mutualisation or the joint issuance of public debt – to which Ms Berès and Mr Tremosa i Balcells referred – after the difficult decision on the reinforcement of the euro area financial firewalls was taken just two weeks ago by the Euro Group, now is the time to focus on the next steps to elaborate how we can make concrete progress in this very important field. That is why the Commission presented the Green Paper a few months ago. We have received feedback on that and will shortly be providing you with information on the results of the consultation before making our proposal on the basis of this consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why the new economic governance is so crucial and essential, because any form of partial joint issuance of public debt which would help to stabilise the European economy is only acceptable in Europe for many Member States if they can be certain that fiscal prudence and economic sustainability are ensured and guaranteed. That is the job of the new economic governance we have created together. I can see that the further reinforcement of economic governance, on the one hand, and consideration of steps towards partial joint issuance of public debt, on the other, move very much in parallel, hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for this debate. The Commission is always here for constructive, critical, substantive and serious debate with you. You can rest assured that the Commission defends a very ambitious policy agenda of sustainable growth and job creation in Europe. But we also need the EU Member States on board for this, and I count on your support, because this is what really matters to our citizens. Sustainable growth, job creation and employment really matter to our citizens in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compromise that is finally reached represents a tiny step forward rather than a significant improvement. This tortoise-like pace puts a brake on the global competitiveness of the EU. We have to recognise that national protectionism makes us lose the most significant element in the control and prevention of every crisis, namely time. Let us take the issue of labour mobility as an example. Currently, there are 4 million job vacancies in Europe. Yet people are reluctant to move where there is work. This is due to linguistic and cultural barriers as well as the tax, pension and social security systems in different Member States. Among the 20 most important problems faced by European citizens in the single market as identified by the Commission, the first few places are taken by uncertainty over different social security systems and health care charges, recognition of professional qualifications and discrimination, tax computation and collection, difficulties with opening bank accounts, and even car registration. Businesses still rarely participate in public tender offerings in other EU states, as they suffer there from unjustifiably complicated registration procedures and non-repayment of VAT. I am convinced that freeing the potential of the European single market is critical in promoting growth and employment. This cannot be achieved without energetic and determined action by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now criticising the current policy of budget cuts in Member States, saying we need to increase pro-growth measures and create jobs, while it seems the answer is not nearly so obvious. The economists are saying that, on the one hand, the cuts which have been made in the euro area countries are too high and have not yet proved effective, while, on the other hand, increasing spending will cause a further fall in investor confidence and, as a result, a further worsening of the situation. I think the optimal solution would be an appropriate combination of these two approaches on a Europe-wide scale and finding a sensible method which the markets will accept, whereas in Member States with relatively stable public finances, we should intensify measures to stimulate growth and employment. The European Commission should make efforts to complete construction of the European internal market, which, despite the fact that it was established almost 20 years ago, is still not making full use of its potential because it is, in fact, the single market which promotes cooperation and the development of all its participants. In addition, the Services Directive needs to be strengthened further to increase the free flow of services in the European market. At a time when access to money is difficult, an interesting proposal is found in project bonds, which are intended to allow the EU to finance a significant part of its investment expenditure in the current decade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although a number of areas of society need reform, I believe there is a need to adopt long-term measures that will put the EU on the path to economic growth, job creation and wealth generation. I believe that only joint European effort will enable the creation of strategic synergies among Member States, and a move away from the budgetary austerity stage towards a new economic growth stage. I agree with the words of the President of the European Commission that there is a need to move from actions to words, gearing the EU budget towards investment in growth and employment. I would congratulate the Commission on the European policies it has been promoting, particularly the European Semester, the reallocation of EUR 82 billion from the EU funds, and increased support for Europe’s 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises and for youth employability. I should also like to express my hope for, and confidence in, the European project’s future: I believe increased economic and financial integration will enable us to make our societies safer and to assert Europe as the world’s major power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament came to this conclusion almost two years ago. A policy that focuses only on rigorous saving, without balancing it out with investments in growth and jobs, is strangling the European economy. The fact that the Commission has finally come up with a jobs package is, in itself, commendable but, unfortunately, this is again too little, too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of putting jobs and growth centre stage in the European Semester, the communication confines itself to listing a mishmash of existing measures without developing a strong legislative basis and without setting aside the necessary resources. There can be only one conclusion: this ‘employment package’ is a fig leaf. Meanwhile, a broad consensus has grown in support of our criticism that the narrow-minded perspective of savings and fiscal consolidation is leading the EU straight into the abyss.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, high time that the Commission came up with a real growth plan and put growth and job creation centre stage in the European Semester. The time of empty talk is over; we need tough legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This unbridled speculation created a climate of distrust, destabilised the whole continent and crippled investor confidence. While the markets now have Spain in their sights, it is imperative that we continue to strengthen public finances to restore a climate of confidence, crucial to the sustainable recovery of economic activity. Alongside efforts to improve public accounts, which are, I assure you, a prerequisite for building sustainable growth, we must enact reforms strong enough to boost the recovery. Therefore, I support the proposal to reduce income tax, by shifting taxation in part towards VAT, in order to boost employment and the competitiveness of our workforce. Such a measure will facilitate our exports and support our trade surplus. Finally, in my opinion, the European Central Bank should also participate in achieving growth objectives by lending directly to Member States rather than going through the intermediary of banks. This direct injection of new funding would grease the economic machine and support the real economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
