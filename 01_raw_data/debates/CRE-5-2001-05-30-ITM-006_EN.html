<p class="contents">Talks were held in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader, Chairman Kim Chung-il, and the number two in the North Korean power hierarchy Kim Chong-nam, and in Seoul with President Kim Dae-jung. The High Representative Javier Solana and Commissioner Chris Patten participated.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative for the mission was taken in December last year when President Kim Dae-jung visited Stockholm, in connection with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, for talks with the Swedish Prime Minister Mr Persson. President Kim Dae-jung emphasised that Sweden’s long-established contacts with the countries on the Korean peninsula could play a valuable role during the Swedish Presidency. Following discussions between the EU Member States and also with representatives of both North and South Korea a decision on the mission was made at the EU Summit in Stockholm on 23-24 March 2001. The visit was based on the Council’s conclusions and guidelines from October and November 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">During its visit to Pyongyang on 2-3 May the EU delegation had long talks with substantial content with Kim Chung-il, and thereafter this was presented to President Kim Dae-jung in South Korea. In summary, the results were good.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, an assurance was given that North Korea will stand by the common declaration made at the inter-Korean Summit in Pyongyang in June 2000. An assurance was also given that Chairman Kim Chung-il wishes to see a second summit, but that the time must be right for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Chairman Kim Chung-il emphasised secondly the importance of relations between the USA and North Korea and inter-Korean relations developing in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, he confirmed that North Korea would stand by the 1994 framework agreement between North Korea and the USA, as well as by the missile moratorium until 2003. However, missile exports would not cease until North Korea received promises of compensation for any lost export revenues. The exports were a purely commercial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, North Korea also acknowledged the need for economic reforms and agreed to send a North Korean delegation to Europe to learn more about the market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, Chairman Kim Chung-il confirmed that North Korea was willing to start a discussion on human rights with the EU. From the EU side it was emphasised that the issue of human rights is of central importance for the EU’s policy. I hope that a first meeting will be able to take place during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the need for better working conditions and inspection of aid projects by the UN and non-governmental organisations in North Korea was discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the South Korean side was very positive towards the results of the meeting, particularly the assurances concerning a second summit and missile defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s visit was a fruitful one. However, the results of our efforts cannot be finally assessed for a couple of years yet. The USA will naturally play an important part in the continued process, but the EU’s efforts are not unimportant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Union's role in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is complementary to that of the three main players: South Korea, United States of America and Japan. Contrary to some press speculation, this mission was not intended as an attempt to supplant the American role: the US was briefed in advance and fully supported the initiative. Thus press reports of an EU-diplomatic challenge to the United States were way off the mark. The timing, however, was influenced by our desire to help maintain momentum in the reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula while the United States is finalising its policy review.</p>
<p class="contents">The visit obtained, as we have already heard, significant results and the European Union team had some five hours of interesting discussion with President Kim Chung-il during which it was able to address its concerns in full. We are now following up in five areas: first, existing assistance is being continued. A maximum allocation of EUR 7 million is foreseen for humanitarian assistance and EUR 20 million for food aid and food security under the 2001 budget. The most appropriate projects to support and the conditions to be applied will be discussed with North Korea in the coming weeks. Secondly, preparations to launch our technical assistance are moving ahead and a project identification mission to North Korea is expected shortly in order to agree the design of two pilot projects with the North Korean authorities: these will each be close to EUR 1 million and will aim particularly at training officials in key ministries and at basic institution building. Third, preparations are going ahead to organise discussions with North Korea on human rights in Brussels on 13 June. Fourthly, we are exploring ways to develop a dialogue with North Korea on economic reform by organising study visits to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth and finally, we are studying options for diplomatic accreditation arrangements with North Korea following the decision to establish diplomatic relations on 14 May. Since this will require negotiations, I do not wish to speculate at this point on the detail. Meanwhile, we await with interest the completion of the US policy review on North Korea and hope that this will lead to progress in the inter-Korea reconciliation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must, indeed, be aware of its own stake in the future of the Korean peninsular. Last January, the European Parliament asked both the Council and the Commission, following a visit from an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation, to take the measures needed to consolidate the policy of <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>between North and South Korea and open up North Korea to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">In calling for the normalisation of relations between the European Union and North Korea, we did not mean to imply that we recognised a political regime which is a far cry from the fundamental values which we preach; we meant to imply that we support the so-called sunshine policy which President Kim Du-Yung has inaugurated with much courage and determination, because we realised that, without the active support of the international community, this policy would be doomed to failure in the long term and would quickly run out of steam in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we appreciate the efforts being made by the Council and the Commission to achieve normalisation with a view to laying down coherent lines of action as regards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to note that the European Union insisted on extending the <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>initiated with South Korea and the commitments made to it to Pyongyang. We have always insisted that the entire nation should have access to foreign aid and that NGOs should be able to work in satisfactory conditions. Other measures, such as granting visas and working facilities to European journalists would help to create the trust needed to put this <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>on a more stable footing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close simply by saying that we must not overlook the fact that the process initiated will be long and gradual but that it is important in order to maintain the peace in this part of the world on which our own stability and security also depend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes very much the official visit to North Korea and to Seoul by the Council, Commission and the High Representative of the CFSP. Commissioner Patten, when he reported back to the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, said that the visit had gone ahead with modest aims, but those modest aims have been achieved and we welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">As a parliamentarian, I am rather disappointed that the delegation managed to fit in 75 journalists but could not manage any parliamentarians on the grounds that the delegation was a small one. I hope on future occasions the Commission and the Council might consider taking some parliamentarians along, particularly in the light of the fact that relations between North Korea and the European Union were pioneered by the European Parliament, over two years ago, when we sent our first official delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that there were good talks with Kim Chong-il. Clearly North Korea is a state of concern. We welcome the fact that they are continuing their moratorium on missile tests until 2004. I recognise that at the moment they have very little option but to export military equipment. They produce hardly any goods that anyone wants to buy apart from military equipment. So it is hardly surprising that the No-dong I and No-dong II weapons which have a range of 1 300 kilometres have been sold to Iran, Syria and Pakistan or that the North Koreans are giving military aid to the Congo, Iran, Ethiopia and Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem will be if they continue to test the Taepodong, which will have a range of something between 4 000 and 6 000 kilometres. Obviously we welcome the moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid. We need improved access for European Union monitors to make sure that the aid is being distributed properly. We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector, particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place. It is important to train North Koreans in modern industrial and clerical skills and we need to give aid in a non-nuclear energy sector as well as raising the textile quotas. It is important that we have a human rights dialogue and I welcome the fact that on 13 June that dialogue is going to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">No one has mentioned KADO; the European Union is participating in the KADO programme for building two nuclear power stations in North Korea. Unfortunately, we have cut the budget this time compared to the last time and if we are serious about assisting Kim Dae-jung with his sunshine policy that sends exactly the wrong signals. We are very keen that diplomatic relations be established and I urge the Commission and the Council to consider placing an office in Pyongyang rather than making the Beijing office responsible for North Korea. There will be no day-to-day contact if that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a distinction at the moment between the EU and the US and we hope we can move forward together, but if we cannot we will have to move forward separately, because the direction we are going is the right one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After a surge of optimism last year, North Korea’s apparent process of opening up towards the outside world and developing relations with its southern neighbours has entered a period of stagnation. Some would even say it was going backwards. Well, personally, I wonder whether the visit by the European delegation last month was not a little premature. Commissioner Patten told us yesterday – and it was repeated today – that human rights were also discussed during the talks, and they are systematically violated in this last of the communist dictatorships. He did not tell us what the outcome was though, which suggests to me that not much was achieved. Would it not have been better to obtain concessions in this delicate area first and then grant the reward of a visit to Pyongyang? We hold cards that can induce the North Korean regime to treat its citizens decently and we are morally obliged to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of this visit that worries me is the relationship with the United States, which has a dominant position in that region and responsibilities far greater than Europe’s. Commissioner Patten has told us that, even in this case, Washington was consulted about the visit. However, as the Commission mentioned, influential American commentators – including former Secretary of State, Mr Kissinger – were quite astonished at this mission, which gives the impression of wanting to fill and profit from a void temporarily left by the United States where, as we know, a review of policy on North Korea is in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like reassurances from the Commission and the Council on these two points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Santer, we can agree with everything you said and I also understand that working conditions for NGOs was one of the issues raised during the visit: the delegation understood that things have improved in the last year although there is probably very much more to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Ford, maybe we are sometimes rigid in how we set up our delegations. This was in the troika formation and journalists come anyway. They were not part of the delegation, but they come. Sometimes, of course, one could invite MEPs, but I understand that on this issue there is a good cooperation between the European Parliament, Commission and Council and I hope that can continue. I do not have the right to say that in future there should be participation of MEPs, but we have noted your comment on this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the modalities of establishing diplomatic relations, this will soon be discussed with the North Koreans and I understand that no decision has yet been taken on the opening of a delegation, where it should be and how it should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have covered the most important issues raised. Thank you for your contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
