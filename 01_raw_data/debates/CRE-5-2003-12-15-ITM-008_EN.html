<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, in 1977, the Council adopted the Sixth VAT Directive. It was a tremendous step towards the effective removal of restrictions on the movement of persons, goods, services and capital and the integration of national economies. For the first time, the Community had a harmonised base of taxation and a harmonised list of exempted goods and services. Among them, the Community legislator, in 1977, included those supplied by the public postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">This exemption dates from a time where in most Member States, the post office was a branch of the government with a monopoly on postal services. At the time, the post office undoubtedly was a public postal service and the exemption of its services caused no distortion of competition because no competition was possible.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts no longer hold true. In most Member States, the post office is no longer a branch of the government, but a commercial enterprise operating under commercial law. In some cases its shares are sold on the stock markets. Some Member States already apply VAT to post, or to some or all services provided by the universal service provider, recognising the problems caused by an outdated exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these companies are now expanding their operations to other Member States in order to reap the benefits of the internal market just like other third-country postal operators are doing. Consumers now demand services that only companies with a presence in several European markets can provide. But, under current rules, a company which supplies exempt postal services in Member State A is obliged to charge VAT in Member State B, because that country does not recognise it as a public postal service.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal market is now largely liberalised. Although, as is often the case, post liberalisation advances at a different pace in each Member State, in all of them - in great measure due to the approval of Directive 97/67/EC, operators other than the former monopolies can and do operate. Since several operators provide postal services and VAT legislation does not treat them equally, distortion of competition inevitably occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">A VAT exemption is not an unmixed blessing. Notably, it results in an inability to deduct input VAT, which in turn discourages investment. At a time where competition exists in the postal market and the communications revolution has created new channels that to some extent compete with post, lower rates of investment put public operators at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind all these changes and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the factual situation in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions concerning VAT must be adopted to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market. The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty. It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has taken into account their opinions, in particular, those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to those services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail which such customers need most. The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction which the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or even neutralise any increase in postal prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was the proponent of the universal service concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the Union has the right to a wide range of affordable and high-quality postal services. Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition. In order to compete in such markets they need a Europe-wide presence and tools such as package tracing, which private and third-country operators already offer to European customers. The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive. Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would invite Members to support the Commission's proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the postal market is in the process of being liberalised at European level and also at national level. As Commissioner Bolkestein has said, the current situation has led to an uneven playing field. Public operators have a competitive advantage over those customers who are not able to claim back VAT, such as private individuals, charities and banks. Private operators are more attractive to VAT-registered companies, although the overall price may be higher, as the customer can reclaim the VAT, which generally results in a lower net cost to the business.</p>
<p class="contents">A further disadvantage of the VAT exemption for public operators is that it favours self-supply. It is therefore more cost-effective for the operator to carry out a service itself than to use subcontractors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that the Commission proposes that the exemption should be removed and that VAT should be charged at the standard rate for all items of mail over two kilos in weight. At the same time, the Member States must be given the option of applying a reduced rate of VAT to items of addressed mail weighing less than two kilos.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission’s assessment. As rapporteur, I also proposed only minor changes in the committee reading. All my proposals were voted down by the committee. In practice, the committee’s proposal means that the European Parliament must reject the Commission’s proposal in its entirety. I think that this would be unfortunate and, together with my colleague Mrs Lulling and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have therefore tabled a series of compromise proposals. Personally, I am not entirely delighted with all these amendments, but I can live with them. I also hope that Commissioner Bolkestein is able to live with them. The amendments are along the right lines and will mean the start of a more properly functioning market. The big changes we are now proposing are aimed, for example, at removing the two-kilo limit for the reduced rate of VAT. It also means clearer demands for a harmonised five to ten per cent VAT band.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, in the first place, to address those fellow MEPs of mine, in particular the British ones, who have been concerned about price rises. As is well known, VAT can be applied and removed. The Commission estimates that the price of a first-class letter in the UK would, for example, increase by 0.3 euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at a reduced rate of 5% and by five euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent. It is worth noting that the UK mail regulator, Postcomm, has arrived at the same conclusion. Talk of price rises is seriously exaggerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, postal services fulfil an important social function, but postage and related costs do, in spite of everything, represent only 0.1 to 0.2 per cent of the average household budget in the EU. The postal operator in my own country, Sweden, has noted that the annual average cost per household for letters and Christmas cards is SEK 190, or EUR 21. In the case of the UK, figures for 1996-1997 indicate that the average annual spend for a UK household was £ 29.40, or EUR 42. On the assumption that this was all spent on sending standard letters costing 28 pence, the impact on the household would be that the annual cost would increase by £ 1.05 to £ 30.45 if the national operator were to increase the postage by one penny. I think that this should be borne in mind during the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Another sensitive subject is the impact on charities. Just like Commissioner Bolkestein, I think that this impact should be countered by the option of being able to claim back the VAT or by special tax rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all those of you in this House who believe in a better, efficient market without obstacles and injustices cannot reject this proposal. I wish, in particular, to address Mrs Lulling and thank her. I wish to thank Mr Radwan, Mr Brunetta and Mr Karas. You have, in any case, helped to obtain some form of unity. Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Goebbels, who have such good judgment on so many other issues, I am relying upon your judgment tomorrow too. If nothing else, you could all listen to your own postal operators, or those that support the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was for this reason that we examined the possibility of introducing VAT in the liberalised working conditions for which we are all striving, and I hope that we will have completed this important task by the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by saying that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is a serious attempt at resolving this problem, but that, at the same time, it is true that good things can still be improved. That was the approach that the Committee on Regional Policy took, and there are, essentially, three things that I would like to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that, in principle, we wanted the minimum VAT rate of 5% to apply to postal services. We are aware of the legal problem involved in certain Member States being required to introduce what would be their fourth rate of VAT. We also take the view that this needs to be handled with particular care. Secondly, consideration should be given to what upper weight limit would apply to a reduced rate of VAT. The Commissioner was right to refer to the obligation to provide a universal service, but there is also the Universal Postal Union Convention, which also describes the consumers’ rights, and we therefore propose, taking the Convention as our guide, the provision of reduced rates of VAT on the sending through the post of items up to 10 kg.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we propose that the entry into force of the directive should be harmonised with the further liberalisation of postal services scheduled for 2006. The Commission should, following a study of this issue, draft and submit proposals on the subject to Parliament and the Council of Ministers for their consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be glad if these proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy could be taken on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Bolkestein was right to remind us that the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax makes no provision for the payment of VAT on postal services. This applies to the traditional providers of postal services, namely the former monopolies, whilst private postal service providers already have to add VAT to their bills.</p>
<p class="contents">Some time ago, in order to make the internal market a reality in the postal services sector, we made a start on the sector’s progressive liberalisation, thus making it possible for private enterprise to operate in it to an ever-greater extent. The new private firms have to charge VAT, whereas the former monopolies are exempted from it, and distortions of competition will, sooner or later, be the result. For a start, the VAT is reflected in the price of the private firms’ end product, but not in that of the traditional postal operators, who – and this is my second point – cannot deduct the VAT that they have to pay on purchases and investments. I am given to understand, though, that the amount of VAT that would be deductible would be quite minimal, as almost 80% of the costs – in Luxembourg at any rate – are accounted for by wages, which are not subject to VAT in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and I have joined in putting forward a solution, one that provides for a reduced rate of VAT on all postal services, although those Member States that already impose very much reduced rates to other products and services would also be able to apply these to postal services. This is a balanced solution, taking into account to the greatest possible degree the interests of all parties; it should also not result in increased prices for stamps.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has proposed a new definition of postal services, which has left me rather surprised. Ever since the 1997 Postal Directive, we have had a definition recognised by all participants in the market and used by them without problems. Any new definition would only make for legal uncertainty, as the parties involved would then be left wondering whether the postal services provided in accordance with the 1997 directive were the same as those that have now had tax imposed on them.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that we may avoid such legal uncertainty and the confusion that it would entail, the rapporteur and I have proposed that, when defining postal services, the VAT Directive should simply refer to the definition in the 1997 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A final and important amendment deals with the point in time at which VAT is to be imposed on postal services. As we are dealing here, in essence, with a problem of potential distortion of competition, VAT should only be levied when such a problem actually becomes apparent. As things stand at present, some national markets are more liberalised than others. The amendment we are tabling provides for the introduction of VAT only when at least 50% of the national market has been liberalised.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains to me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation, and to appeal to those Members who, in the Committee, voted to reject the Commission proposal outright, to reconsider their position, for it would be inappropriate to reject it now. I appeal to our Socialist Members in particular. We have to take a constructive approach to this matter, for only then will we have a chance of our proposals getting a favourable reception from the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the current parliamentary term, the majority has endorsed international, service-oriented companies taking over parts of this work. In the discussion on this subject, various drawbacks have been mentioned, including the fear that in future, an ever-higher price will be charged for an ever-worsening service. Hardly any attention was then paid to the impact on taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The complications are now evident. Public companies do not pay any VAT, but if customers can claim back their VAT, sometimes a private company becomes the cheaper option. As continuing to farm out postal transport to the rail services becomes too expensive, the companies' own use of environmentally-unfriendly lorry transport increases. It is uncertain whether the Member States will declare their high VAT rates or their varying low VAT rates to be applicable. Prices may well increase for the users in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is useful for the rapporteur now to propose postponing the application until such time as the market has been further liberalised and for the draftsman of the opinion to express the wish to increase the weight limit to ten kilograms. Not to privatise would be the best solution. Not the market, but the employees and customers deserve protection, and this is ideally done without this measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, however, we must consider the enormous effort made by Commissioner Bolkestein in order to complete the internal market, which is absolutely crucial to European integration and also to Europe’s economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that this Commission initiative basically makes sense, but unfortunately, the European Parliament should not give its support to it just yet, because such a move, in isolation, would add little to the real discussion, which concerns the crucial liberalisation of the postal services sector. At this stage, given the current structure of the market, the Commission proposal could lead to various unwanted effects, the most perverse of which would surely be the widespread increase in the price of postal services for citizens, without this yielding any immediate benefit. Not even the proposals for amendment and there is no guarantee that they will be adopted would prevent this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed sometimes legitimate to sacrifice this benefit in the short term, especially in the case of public services, although this must only be done if this interest will be safeguarded in the medium and long term, with the clear benefits that this provides. This does not, unfortunately, appear to be the case before us or at least it is not clear that the proposal accepts this fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal services sector has been exempt from VAT since 1977, a time when, it is true, the sector was dominated by State monopolies, which meant that competition was practically non-existent. Despite the changes that have taken place since then, there is absolutely no basis for the idea that this area of public service provision now operates in an open market. And yet, this is the only situation in which the State would be justified in exerting its exclusive power for political regulation without having to resort to tax or other types of incentives that guarantee social effectiveness. If, therefore, we acknowledge that upholding the current status quo for a long time to come could harm the much-needed development of this sector, we must also accept that this proposal alone will not eliminate or reduce existing distortions of competition, especially given the diversity of VAT rates still being applied in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rejecting this initiative can, therefore, only be seen as a recommendation to the Commission to include the proposal in the framework of a broader debate on the total liberalisation of the sector, ensuring that the services provided are completely effective, without overcharging citizens who use the service from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For over a century, the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability. The efficient running of public services, and of the postal services in particular, has for some considerable time been one of the most reliable indicators of a country’s level of development, and, dare I say it, of its level of civilisation. It was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role; it was because they did not exist to be profit-making but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and criss-crossed the land with a dense network of post offices. Such is the progress that both the nation-states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing. We are absolutely opposed to this exercise in the destruction of public services, which is both regressive and socially unjust.</p>
<p class="contents">To this fundamental reason for voting against this report, we would add another, namely that we are indeed opposed to VAT and hence to it being applied, as also to the price increases that it will entail, and from which users on lower incomes will suffer most.</p>

I could have done so earlier but she did not ask for it and therefore I did not think it was necessary to reply.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to her question, the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector and particularly those which must be done according to Directive 97/67/EEC should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector and that it undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendments Nos 7 and 13 proposing to delay the entry into force of the directive until each Member State has achieved a certain degree of liberalisation, the Commission's position is that it cannot accept linking two issues which are quite separate, but the Commission could accept a date of entry into force of the directive no later than January 2006, by which date the Community postal market as a whole should have surpassed that degree of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not support amendments linking the scope of the proposed place of supply rule and reduced rates to Article 2(1) of Directive 97/67/EC. Postal services as defined in that Article are those supplied by the universal service provider. The linkage proposed by that amendment would not eliminate current distortions of competition in the postal market and therefore the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 1, 8, 11 and 12.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of subsidiarity the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 9 which seek to oblige Member States to apply a reduced rate and to prescribe how a certain part of national VAT revenue should be spent. Nor can it accept widening the scope of applicable rates as suggested by Amendments Nos 3 and 10. Such amendments would not be acceptable to a majority of the Council either.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 5, the Commission considers that the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different to those existing today. Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value. They are taxable in all other cases. Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
