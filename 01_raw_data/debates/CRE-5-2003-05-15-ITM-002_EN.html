<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, it falls to me to convey to the House and to the Council the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell’s appointment. I speak on behalf of the chairman of the committee, Mrs Randzio-Plath.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to say that the vote of acceptance, the vote in favour of the appointment of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, was carried unanimously within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I should also like to say that this was no accident. It was because all the members of the committee agreed that the candidate has the requisite training and ability to carry out the task before her.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to say that the committee was fully satisfied with the written and oral answers provided by the candidate. We were particularly impressed with her pertinent responses to questions on three key issues. I am now speaking on behalf of my group. We noted that the candidate is a firm believer in the dogma of price stability formally proclaimed at Maastricht. We found too that the candidate believes equally firmly that it is for the European Central Bank, acting quite independently, to guarantee the dogma of price stability without prejudice to its duty to work towards the other objectives contained in the Treaty. Further, we were delighted to find that the candidate is fully prepared to cooperate with the European Parliament. This will be to the advantage of the European Central Bank. It will render its positions clearer and more public. It will also serve to boost the image of this House. I would remind you that we have been discussing the broad economic guidelines and that all the speakers emphasised the willingness and ability of Parliament to work loyally towards strengthening an economy that is currently in poor shape. Indeed, the European Union as a whole will benefit and Parliament will help to bring the Bank closer to the citizens. The latter will be better able to understand the Bank’s objectives, methods and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to underline, further to this morning’s debate, that Parliament is fully prepared to cooperate with the European Central Bank in its task of maintaining price stability. This stability is one of the main achievements of the latest stage of the European economy launched at Maastricht. I trust this morning’s vote will provide confirmation of this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economic guidelines we would like to point out that it is for the Member States to strive to reduce inflationary pressure in sectors where it occurs, notably in the service sector. It is also for the Member States to create the conditions in which the social partners can initiate a wages policy. This should be a policy of collective negotiation, keeping nominal wages in line with inflation and not allowing them to rise above it. It would also keep real salaries in line with productivity. We are all tasked with ensuring price stability, even though the European Central Bank is specifically charged to do so and will take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the broad economic guidelines we also underlined the need for coherence and consistency across all economic policies if we are to pull ourselves up out of the hole we are in. Monetary policy is handled by the independent Central Bank. Budgetary policies must be consistent across the Union too. They remain within national competence, but are governed and bound by the Stability and Growth Pact. They are also subject to monitoring by Union institutions, including Parliament. These assess stability and convergence programmes, on which we have made recommendations. I referred earlier to wages policies. They also need to be in line, though they are part of national competence. All short-term supply policies required to deal with the economic crisis should be in line too. They must not be allowed to disturb the economic balance. That must be protected at all times by the European Central Bank as regards monetary issues. The Union’s institutions and the Member States will ensure coherence with the Stability Pact is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I imagine Mr Friedrich will mention this too, but we are pleased to note that the candidate is to be appointed for an eight-year term. This should be time enough to see the programme through. We are pleased to note too that the candidate may not stand for re-election, so her independence is guaranteed. On behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs I strongly recommend the Council to appoint the candidate and offer her our congratulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you a unanimous resolution by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to appoint Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and to support this recommendation. Who is this lady? As we observed in the committee – and I am also responding to the critical comments voiced by my fellow Members – she is certainly not a media product. Nor is she a token woman. She is certainly not a cloned version of other comparable bank directors either. Mrs Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell is her own person with rough edges, principles, experience, demonstrable results and intuition. This was why, after the hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 29 April, we all concluded that she merits description as frank, competent and a consummate professional.</p>
<p class="contents">I have six demands to make of the new member of the ECB's Executive Board. Firstly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, please strengthen the independence of the European Central Bank and boost its defences against populist and politically motivated interjections and apportionment of blame, including from politicians! In doing so, however – and this is my second point – do not hide behind the ECB Statute; instead, step up the dialogue on economic and monetary affairs with politicians, with Parliament, with the media and with the citizens of Europe. Thirdly, explain the economic context and background to the decisions more fully. By doing so, you will help to enhance the transparency and comprehensibility of monetary policy decisions. Fourthly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, please also have the courage to make demands and even challenge the politicians – despite, or perhaps even because of, your independence and the variety of tasks on the agenda. We need this competition of ideas, this intellectual rivalry, in order to intensify the economic and monetary policy debate. Fifthly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, you took a leading role in coordinating the preparations for Austria to join the economic and monetary union. I would ask you to place your experience at the disposal of the EU Member States who are not part of the eurozone. Our goal must be to make the euro the home currency of all citizens in all the EU Member States and ensure that it is seen as a strong brand for the most competitive internal market in the world. Sixthly – and a number of speakers have alluded to this – I would ask the new member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board to uphold the principle of price stability and adhere to it rigorously. Price stability produces low inflation and interest rates and is thus the prerequisite for growth, employment and an economic policy leading to prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate will join the ECB Executive Board at a very dynamic and exciting time. There is EU enlargement, which means that we will have more Member States outside the eurozone than in it. There are the different economic cycles, the cyclical and structural problems within the European Union, which we have just been discussing, the absence of economic dynamism, the lack of a pro-active approach and the lack of confidence in politics and economics, the forthcoming conclusion of the Basle II Accord and the drafting of a directive, and also the issue of whether Europe will become the financial centre of the world compared with other continents, regardless of the narrow-minded provincial outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">All this requires a very self-confident, objective and persuasive personality capable of engaging in the debate, not only within the ECB. We are convinced that you are this person and can achieve the levels of performance required. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports your candidacy and wishes you every success. We look forward to what will undoubtedly be very constructive cooperation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be fairly brief. The hearing we have had with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs showed that this lady was very competent and certainly capable of maintaining her crucial role on the European Central Bank’s Executive Board. The Group of the Party of European Socialists will therefore vote in favour of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and we wish her much success in her very difficult work.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me a more general remark which has nothing to do with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell’s candidacy. Until now, all the governors of the European Central Bank have come from the inner circle of central bankers. They therefore give the impression of having come from the same mould and sometimes take the same line, and one which, while it is very often sound, does not always reflect the economic realities of this world. I know that many MEPs, both in my own and also in other groups, would like to see governors from the financial and commercial worlds, and perhaps even from the world of politics, at the heart of the European Central Bank. We should also like to see a lot more women there in addition to Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell alone. I would therefore express the wish that, when appointments are next made, the profile of candidates be deepened a little so as to ensure rather more balanced representation within this crucial institution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank has so far done some excellent work. It has in actual fact made good its wager when it comes to stability. That being the case, the ECB’s task is not only to maintain stability but also to combat deflation. Although it may have defined its stability policy, it has no point of reference for judging when it is necessary to combat recession. For my part, I should like the European Central Bank to conduct a much more pragmatic monetary policy on the model of the American Federal Reserve, which combats not only inflation but also recession and which contributes to other American economic policies.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Friedrich (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, let me begin by saying that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell is an outstanding candidate for this post. It is quite obvious: she has great charisma, she has high-level and demonstrable expertise, and she has a wealth of experience in the field of monetary policy. She meets all the requirements to perform her new role in the service of our monetary system and the euro. What I particularly liked was that when she was responding to the questions from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, she excelled with her brief, concise and persuasive answers. What is also important is that she supports the European Central Bank's basic policy direction, with price stability as the primary objective, and also the new shape of the European Central Bank's pillar structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goebbels, let me tell you that even the new constitution – in its present Article 21 – states that the European Central Bank must guarantee price stability as its primary objective. Of course, it contributes to the achievement of the Union's other goals as well. In this respect, the European Central Bank has performed outstanding work to date. The euro is a stable currency at domestic level, while its value on the external markets is currently amazing almost the entire financial world. What is more, the euro is already making a significant contribution to stabilising the world currency markets. The Maastricht Treaty has also proved its worth inasmuch as re-election is not an option, which means that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell will be appointed for eight years. What is particularly appealing is the fact that we will have a lady as the successor to the outgoing female member from Finland; this demonstrates that we are attempting to ensure that women are appointed on an equal basis to high-level positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am wholeheartedly committed to the central importance of the European Central Bank's objectives. In Germany, the largest Member State in the monetary union, it would be a great mistake if we tried to address our acute problems through the simple but extremely dangerous strategy of taking on further debt and raising taxes. Of course, I cannot rule out that the time may come when a further cut in interest rates, as part of the European Central Bank's policy on interest rates, may reduce the gap with rates in the United States and stimulate business investment and performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the candidate – as Mr Goebbels has indirectly pointed out – also meets the main requirements laid down in the Treaty, namely recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters, I believe that we can support her appointment with a clear conscience. I would like to wish Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell every success, so that Europe can genuinely develop into what we need, namely the most dynamic economic area in the world, offering job opportunities for our young people.</p>

Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell’s curriculum vitae would indicate that she is an excellent choice in terms of the main requirements laid down in the EC Treaty for membership of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, namely personal integrity and recognised standing and professional experience in the monetary and banking field. In addition to these formal qualifications, however, there are three factors that would especially favour the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerel for this job.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, her enormous experience and impressive levels of expertise were natural prerequisites for the job. Even excellent individuals do not succeed on their own merits, however, if their background is felt to be less than favourable. It is likely that Austria’s good reputation as a competitive Member State driving responsible policies under the leadership of its present government helped in making the choice. The Member States of the Union together committed themselves to the Stability and Growth Pact ensuring European competitiveness and economic success. The challenges are largely the same in all the Member States: a damagingly inflexible labour market that allows mass unemployment to continue in the Member States of the European Union, and the need to balance state income and expenditure. An ageing population will put intolerable financial pressures on our pensions and social welfare systems unless we implement the necessary changes in time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Government has taken the first important steps to safeguard its public pensions system. I wish the Austrian Government luck and success in this work, in spite of the considerable resistance to change. The immense importance of public pensions systems is indicated by the fact that it is our poorest citizens in particular who need them most of all to provide for their retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell especially supported the notion that the European Union is a forum of collaboration between Member States of different sizes. To ensure that the Union is equal and functions properly it is essential that experts from the small Member States can also participate directly in decision-making. As a Finn, I know that the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerel, an Austrian, was the right decision from this point of view also.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it was not a foregone conclusion that a woman would be chosen to succeed Sirkka Hämäläinen. I am pleased that female representation in the European Central Bank’s main decision-making body was allowed to continue, and obviously with no compromises being made with regard to expertise and professional skill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is a good basis for setting new objectives in this key area of economic policy in future as well. At the hearing, we were told that she will work on developing new structures for the future of Europe. I met her in person at the debates on Basle II, and there too, she was able to assure us, very competently, that this issue is being taken seriously and that the European Central Bank is certainly also preparing analyses on this topic. I think that the issue of Basle II, especially as regards the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises and the securities they are required to provide, and the introduction of Basle II must be properly prepared, and the European Central Bank will play an important part in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the inclusion of the social partners in this area is also essential so that the requisite preparations can be made by common consent, for liquidity is naturally very important for the enterprises. After all, the wages have to be paid at the end of each month and in many cases, financial arrangements with the banks must be made as a matter of great urgency, and this can only be guaranteed if appropriate securities are provided. That is why we want best practice and benchmarking in tax policy as well, so that in future, adequate risk and own capital can be made available to the companies.</p>

We are concerned here with Rules 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter 2 of the provisions in force since 1 July 1998 and governing the holding of meetings in parallel with our Parliament’s plenary sittings.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle is that our Parliament should not organise any meeting of its Members when the plenaries are being held, the rare exceptions being mentioned in Rule 3 and no exception being tolerated in the case of the crucial sittings at which votes are taken. I would point out to you that quite a few of our fellow MEPs that are members of the Convention – in theory, 32, consisting of 16 representatives and 16 deputy representatives – have for the most part had to leave this Chamber in order to be present at the important work of the Convention which will begin this afternoon on the premises of our Parliament, but in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">So that our fellow MEPs might have done their work both as members of the Convention and as legislators, it would have been enough for the work of the Convention – which our Parliament happily has the privilege of hosting – to take place for once in our Strasbourg buildings. Due to our absurd petty squabbling, this morning’s votes are going to be tainted with irregularity, because any votes that are passed by a majority lower than or equal to 32 may be suspected of having been distorted. I leave it to you to be the judges of the possible legal and political consequences of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would also point out to you that, if we do not take steps, this same regrettable situation is going to occur again at our plenary on Thursday 5 June.</p>
