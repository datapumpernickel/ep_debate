There are economic and commercial reasons for this, but there is also the essential need for political cooperation in order to create a world order of peace and stability. It is essential that our Asian partners see us as an economic, industrial, scientific and cultural power, but also that they appreciate our process of continental integration and the democratic values and solidarity on which this process is based.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the announcement that the Government of Myanmar has been invited to the Asia-Europe Summit to be held in Hanoi. We do not believe this invitation to be appropriate. The European Union must continue to isolate the Rangoon regime, making clear to its neighbours that we condemn it as one of the most horrendous regimes in Asia and in the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">The military dictatorship established by General Ne Win has been perpetuated by his successors, suffocating the libertarian efforts of Burmese democrats through suffering and terror.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us who know and love Burma, the sadness and indignation is all the greater since we know that it was once, with social democratic inspired governments, an example of openness, freedom and democracy, tolerance, co-existence and integration of numerous ethnic groups and, what is more, of social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this was destroyed by the perpetrators of the military coup, the creators of a totalitarian and corrupt regime which has left its country in ruins, its leaders growing rich while its citizens live in misery and turning Myanmar into a significant player in the international drugs trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must contribute to marginalising that regime, demanding freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and other prisoners of conscience, and the participation of political parties in any democratically oriented process.</p>
<p class="contents">However much Rangoon tries to cover it up, that is the situation in Myanmar, where totalitarianism, corruption and the abuse of those people we could once trust to promote openness continue to reign.</p>
<p class="contents">By excluding that regime from the Hanoi Summit, the European Union will be doing what is right, but furthermore our determination and consistency will consolidate our credibility in the eyes of our Asian partners and certainly in the eyes of the people of Myanmar.</p>

<p class="contents">The Burmese military dictatorship is now in its 43rd year of illegitimate rule. It is 15 years since Aung San Suu Kyi was first put under house arrest and 14 years since the SPDC decided to disregard the will of the Burmese people as expressed in the 1990 elections. In spite of this, the Council's message that is now being sent to the Burmese dictatorship is that it is an acceptable and welcome member of the international community, irrespective of its oppressive activities. In 1997 Burma's entry into ASEAN was heralded as a means to exert pressure on the regime. All we have heard from ASEAN is mild rebuke. The Burmese dictatorship ignored this and nothing more has happened. Six years after Burma joined ASEAN, oppression in the country has intensified and any return to democratic rule remains a distant prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">This October ASEAN intends to include Burma at the ASEM V summit in Hanoi. I am the first to understand that Europe's relationship with ASEAN is widely based and most important. It should not be hostage to Burma, but that is what the ASEAN states are allowing to happen. The Asian governments must realise that they may be sacrificing a rewarding partnership with the European Union for the sake of a morally bankrupt regime in Burma. We must demand Burma's exclusion from ASEM until it complies with the demands of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that there are some similarities with the situation concerning Zimbabwe. There again we have an atrocious regime, which in many respects is even more abusive to its people than the Burma dictatorship. There again we have had half-hearted sanctions by the EU going through the motions of taking action, but in effect allowing the regime off the hook because of the self-interested agenda of one or two of our Member States. There again neighbouring states have the key to change, but for their own misguided reasons refused to turn it. The EU does not put pressure on them.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the ASEAN states to insist on the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and on freedom for the NLD opposition. The EU Foreign Ministers must demand that they do this before Burma is allowed to sit down with them in Hanoi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even so, whereas incidents concerning the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi and the impossibility for the LND, the party which won the elections, to exert its political power are well known, less well known are other extremely serious facts concerning the conscription of child soldiers, the forced labour of a large part of the population and, something which the women in our Parliament, and I believe all civilised people, appreciate as particularly sensitive, the abuse inflicted upon women from ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is substantial documentation at the United Nations which I think should also be examined more thoroughly by this Parliament. In this situation, we feel that the EU should accept the request of the ASEAN countries, which have already admitted Myanmar to their forum, to have it attend the next ASEM summit, which sees the European Union engaged in a dialogue of cooperation and political exchange with Asian countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Foreign Ministers, at an informal meeting, have unexpectedly – if I may say so – already gestured their agreement that it should attend. I think that the European Council must adopt a different stance to resolve a situation whereby European citizens cannot see their Heads of State or Government sitting side by side with the representatives of such a bloodthirsty country, with such a violent and repressive regime. We therefore ask the European Council to adopt a different position which, through the ASEAN countries, can convince Myanmar to bring about change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmidt, Frithjof (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Burmese people’s struggle for democracy has been a long one; there was a ray of hope in 1990, when the National League of Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work for non-violent change, won the elections with 82% of the votes, but, since then, the country has been ruled by a savage military dictatorship, which has placed her under house arrest and harassed her; there are over 1 000 political prisoners. Organisations tell us that, for example, the armed forces have also started using systematic rape as a weapon against ethnic minorities. There is widespread violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">From that time onwards, the military dictatorship has been repeatedly denounced by international institutions, the European Parliament and the Council among them, and their constant demands have been threefold: freedom for the NLD to engage in political activity, freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and the initiation of political dialogue aimed at advancing the country’s democratisation process. It was a major breakthrough when, at the 2004 ASEM Summit in Kildare, the Asian states supported these demands as the minimum requirement before Burma would be able to take part in future ASEM summits.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see, then, that there is a broad consensus in the international community that these conditions must be fulfilled, and it is one that this House has repeatedly underlined. It is therefore quite incomprehensible and utterly deplorable that the foreign ministers of the European Union have now taken the decision simply to abandon the criteria and political conditions that they themselves imposed and agree to Burma’s participation in ASEM summits without their being complied with. Nor is there any reason to suppose that conditions in Burma have changed for the better, or anything like that, in recent months – quite the contrary is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an about-turn is quite incomprehensible and threatens to damage the credibility of European policy, for why, now, should anyone take our resolutions seriously? Who is going to take the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers seriously when they have spent ten years saying, ‘this is the condition that must be met before you can take part’, and then, when the situation presents itself, say, ‘we didn’t mean it like that, we’ll let it go’. We all know, of course, that there has been discussion behind the scenes about the business interests involved. We all know that it is argued in business circles that we must now take a more cautious approach to Burma, that China wants to grab the Burmese market for itself, and that the European Union’s competitiveness is at risk if we do not take a softer line on Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Such is the background music to a decision like this, and I believe that we in this House must say, loud and clear, that what is at stake here is the credibility of European foreign policy’s values. We have to make it clear that it is by these values that European foreign policy continues to be guided, and that we stand by our own resolutions. We have to make it clear that the foreign ministers have taken the wrong decision and that this House continues to take a critical line on the Burmese Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the previous speaker, Mr Schmidt, has said, the three necessary conditions for Burma's attendance at the meeting have not been met: the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy leaders, their freedom to participate freely in the National Convention, and the modification of procedure of the National Convention. Meanwhile, according to Amnesty International, there have been thousands of reported cases of rape being used as a political weapon to subdue ethnic minorities. As recently as last week, it was reported that the Women's League of Burma maintains that such rape is prevalent in many areas and that victims are frequently under the age of 18 and even under the age of 12 in at least one case. It is well known that the Burmese military is also believed to have a higher percentage of child soldiers than any other military in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly oppose Burma's participation in the forthcoming meeting and I hope that the invitation to Burma will be withdrawn until democracy is restored and Aung San Suu Kyi set free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, however, a few observations to be made in respect of the summit. Burma has already been mentioned, and I will return to it presently.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I have to say that, although holding the summit in Vietnam is naturally a showcase for the reforms achieved in that country, it nevertheless has to be noted that there is still a yawning chasm between the dream of an effective and honest trading environment and reality. I have taken a stand in this House before – in October 2001 and also a year ago – for Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam, for example. After a long-term stay abroad, he had made investments in his home country, and these were taken away from him under false pretences. His possessions were confiscated and he was imprisoned. Tragic though this was for him and his family, above all, it sent a negative message to potential investors in Vietnam. In my view, it is time the Vietnamese Government made a gesture in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, human rights are a topic of discussion also in other countries in the region, and remain so. Thailand is a case in point. It is true that the Dutch and the Thai Governments have just signed an extradition agreement for the exchange of the Dutch prisoners who have been behind bars for a long time. This is a welcome step forward, but in the case of the prisoner, Machiel Kuijt, with which I am particularly concerned, it was agreed that he would appear before the court of cassation before 1 July. That still has not happened, and I hope that the Thai Government will deliver on its promise. Incidentally, the Commission has made a positive contribution in this area. It would be good if the Council could do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Burma has been mentioned. No other Asian country is struggling with human rights and democracy as much as Burma. Moreover, its problems are historical. Naturally, the liberals propose a dialogue in principle, provided it is a dialogue in which both parties participate seriously. If not, there is no point whatsoever in sitting around the negotiating table. In my view, the other Asian countries, particularly the ASEAN countries, which are so insistent that Burma should take part in those talks, also have a responsibility to ensure finally that Burma is taking this kind of dialogue seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Burmese authorities have not cooperated with the UN special envoys, and the latest attack on Aung San Su Kyi and the NDL is a further setback. The world must not forget about the rest of the country, which is suffering from serious oppression. Discrimination against different ethnic groups, the confiscation of property, and the existence of political prisoners, forced labour, political rape and child soldiers have been well documented, as well as the burning down of villages. Fifty per cent of the national budget goes to the military. Money comes from foreign business and investment. The brutal military dictatorship is the root cause of the problems ravaging Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions that would bite have never been strictly applied. Burma has not met any of the three criteria set by the EU in April. All members of the Committee on Development who have spoken in the debate feel strongly that the EU should not participate in the ASEM Summit in Hanoi with Burma. Instead, the EU should increase and toughen sanctions against the regime leaders and should impose sanctions on the European corporations that do business with the Burmese regime, and specifically the French oil company Total. The EU should urge countries such as the USA, Australia and Japan to do likewise. EU members should ask the United Nations Security Council to impose marked targeted sanctions against the Burmese military regime, since it massively violates human rights, sends refugees into neighbouring countries, and sponsors the production of drugs and crime. It would be a shame if at the ASEM Summit the EU allowed Burma to be dismissed as a minor issue in its overall relations with Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission is gravely concerned about the situation in Burma and, since 2001, has been using the Asia-Europe meetings of the ASEM process to reiterate this concern to Heads of State and Government, ministers and senior officials from the ten South-East and North-East Asian countries which participate in the ASEM meetings. I do not have to impress on the honourable Members of the European Parliament how important the ASEM summits are in the EU political dialogue with Asia, being the only occasions when EU Heads of State meet South-East and North-East Asian Heads of State in a group-to-group dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely clear that all members of the European Union remain highly critical of the military regime in Rangoon and the European Union will continue to repeat our demand for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy. Unfortunately, so far the Burmese Government has shown no sign of fulfilling this, or the other two conditions of the Tullamore Gymnich.</p>
<p class="contents">Great efforts have recently been made to find a solution which would allow the ASEM summits to take place. The Commission is of the opinion that we have been able to find a compromise which is acceptable to all. We have been able to reach this agreement, because we value EU relations with Asia too much to allow our ASEM dialogue to be taken hostage by the behaviour of the regime in Rangoon. The EU has reached an agreement on the participation of Burma in the ASEM summit, together with the 10 new EU members, Cambodia and Laos, but the European Union expects Burma to participate at a level lower than Head of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in order to send a strong signal to the Burmese regime that we do not agree with its policies, the European Union has decided to strengthen the targeted measures against the Burmese regime if it has not fulfilled the Tullamore conditions by the time of the ASEM summit. Ministers have agreed to expand the visa ban list to include serving members of the military of the rank of brigadier-general and above, and members of their families, and prohibit EU-registered companies or organisations from making any finance, such as loans or equity, available to named Burmese state-owned enterprises. In addition, EU Member States will vote against extending loans to Burma from international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also looking at ways and means to take concrete action against illegal logging, while extending assistance to the Burmese population, especially on health and education, via international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the solution to the political situation in Burma will have to be generated within Burma and within the region, I am convinced that our dialogues in ASEM contribute positively towards future reform in Burma. The Commission therefore looks forward to the ASEM V summit in Hanoi on 8 and 9 October, which in the context of wider discussions will allow a discussion with Asian leaders on human rights and prospects for reform in Burma and allow us to communicate our concerns to the Burmese representatives there.</p>
<p class="contents">Working closely with the EU Member States and especially the successive EU Council presidencies, the Commission is committed to all the appropriate efforts, whether they are diplomatic, political, or developmental, that might facilitate and accelerate the democratic and human rights reforms within Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
