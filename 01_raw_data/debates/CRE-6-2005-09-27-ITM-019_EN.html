<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Verheugen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at half past three this afternoon, the Commission adopted a communication on its ‘better lawmaking’ policy, and this communication was immediately forwarded to your House and to the Council. The Commission has undertaken a comprehensive and systematic review of all the draft legislation presented by it prior to 1 January 2004 and not yet adopted, and today sees its announcement of the outcome. I would also like to say that all the things that may have appeared in this or that newspaper do not amount to a decision by the Commission, and that most of them are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s communication is a first step, and a relatively small one, towards the completion of the far greater and more demanding project of ‘Better Lawmaking in Europe’, with which we have two ends in view, namely both to build up the public’s confidence in European integration and to counteract the impression that the European Union is a regulation-crazed and bureaucratic monstrosity. At the same time, we want to liberate the forces for growth in the economy that have been tied down by excessive or excessively complex rules and regulations. We must not underestimate the dangerous effect of the perception of Brussels as no more than an enormous and rather impenetrable bureaucracy, and this is where we all – in the Commission, Parliament and the Council – need to demonstrate by our actions that Europe is not like that.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Better Lawmaking’ is also an essential part of the initiative for growth and employment. In Brussels, the Commission has stated that it, in its work, gives priority to growth and to the creation of more jobs. It has revised the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment with this in mind and highlighted the area of policy that can make a decisive contribution to the enhancement of growth and to the creation of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Better Lawmaking’ is one of these core policy areas. From my many, many conversations with representatives of European businesses, I know that many of them regard it, indeed, as the most important. Small, medium-sized and micro-businesses in particular wait with longing to have their burdens removed. Securing Europe’s position as a business location and improving its chances in global competition are both absolutely dependent on our having a successful purge of red tape, annulling regulations that have become meaningless and offering industry and service providers a modern legal framework on which they can rely in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I will speak plainly to you, honourable Members: this is not about the sort of deregulation that is weighed down with ideological baggage; this is about making regulation better. The single market needs an unambiguous and reliable legal framework, but we must also ensure that our societies are not weighed down with unnecessary bureaucracy, and that the public can be certain that European law is drafted with the greatest possible care and will take effect only where European regulations are absolutely necessary. That is something on which the institutions agree. Let me repeat that we are all in the same boat and share responsibility. That is the political context of the Commission communication on the review of pending legislative proposals. One might describe it as the <span class="italic">hors d’oeuvre</span> of a menu, the main course of which is yet to be served. I do hope, though, that the <span class="italic">hors d’oeuvre</span> goes down well.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy forms part of a broader-based strategy, which is itself founded upon three pillars. Firstly, the Commission regularly submits to systematic examination all the legislative proposals it has presented, yet which have not been adopted by the legislator within a given period of time, the object of this exercise being to decide whether the proposals can be withdrawn, or whether decision-making can be made easier by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, this year, reviewed all the regulations that were still waiting for adoption on the cut-off date of 1 January 2004, looking to see whether proposals had become obsolete, had been held up in the legislative process for some considerable time, whether their review was called for by reason of new scientific knowledge, changes in the market or other considerations, or whether they met present-day standards in terms of their expected cost and their likely effect on competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The end result of this is that, of the 183 proposals it has reviewed, the Commission intends to withdraw 68 on the grounds of their incompatibility with the goals of growth and employment or with the criteria for better lawmaking, their being – quite objectively speaking – no longer relevant, or the improbability of their making further progress through the legislative process in their present form.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of five of the proposals mentioned in the communication, the Commission recommends that the legislative process be proceeded with, although it does, before this happens, wish to submit in-depth economic analyses in order to help the legislative body to come to a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that some proposals are being withdrawn as part of a wide-ranging review of Community policies, although the Commission is retaining the option of, after this process, submitting revised proposals accompanied by a comprehensive assessment of their cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the Commission, this afternoon, in communicating to the Council and Parliament which proposals it intends to withdraw, is complying with its obligations under the framework agreement on relations between it and Parliament. The proposals selected will be regarded as formally withdrawn only as and when an announcement to this effect is made in the Official Journal.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s communication is concerned with pending proposals for legislation, which constitutes the first part of the Commission’s strategy. As the <span class="italic">acquis </span>itself is not tampered with in any way, it has no direct effect on the economic process. In evaluating the result, I think there are three things that it is important to bear in mind. One is that the number of pending proposals for legislation was far smaller than many had expected. In two-thirds of all cases, the review has led us to the conclusion that there are good reasons for the proposals to be retained, and only one-third of them overall fall short of our requirements in terms of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This screening process represents the first test for the credibility of our ‘Better Lawmaking’ policy and will be a trial run for the implementation of the real project, to which I shall now turn. That project is called ‘simplification of the regulatory framework’, and is the biggest project to be embarked on under the ‘Better Lawmaking’ policy. The Commission will now respond to the European Parliament’s resolution, adopted earlier this year, on the renewal of the Lisbon Strategy by proceeding to a comprehensive and systematic review of the European Union’s <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. I am talking here about over 20 000 pieces of legislation. At the end of October, the Commission will come to a decision on the principles and criteria by which this will be guided, and on how, organisationally speaking, we are going to get on top of this gargantuan task. The one thing that is certain is that this Herculean labour will demand that all three institutions work as closely together as possible, and the Commission will inform Parliament as soon as a decision has been taken on the procedures and methodology.</p>
<p class="contents">The third pillar has to do with the standards applicable to future legislation and the assessment of its impact. The Commission sees it as being of the utmost importance that lawmaking should, in future, be significantly improved and made subject to rigorous standards, and has already decided that all proposals for legislation, White Papers and policy statements underlying its work programme should be accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments. It has recently adopted detailed directives on the methodology to be used and will, next year, commission an external analysis of all the impact assessments already submitted. The Commission is also engaged, with the help of a network of outside experts, in building up the available analysis and scientific knowledge on which impact assessments rely. It regards the new criteria for future lawmaking as decisive in setting our direction for the future, and as making it possible to really cut back bureaucracy and take the burden off businesses and the authorities in the Member States. Some Member States have already adopted a policy of this kind and are achieving remarkable successes with it, freeing business and administration from unnecessary costs and thereby achieving measurable added growth. That is what we want for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This, honourable Members, is something that we will need to discuss in depth, and, while the Commission will have the utmost regard for Parliament’s responsibility, this policy will need to be supported by the Member States. I very much hope that this debate sends out the clear message that, this time, Europe is getting serious about this. One thing we all agree on is that we need better laws and less bureaucracy. Even at this early stage, I can tell you that this project of codifying disparate pieces of legislation is very far from being the end of what we shall do. We shall also be considering whether regulations are still needed at all or whether they need to be made more user-friendly, that is to say, rewritten. Europe’s competitiveness will be one yardstick – but not the only one – whereby this will be measured, and let me say, lest there be any doubt about it, that the object is not to make Europe less integrated than it already is or to alter the balance between the three great policy goals of growth, social cohesion and sustainable development. Far from ‘Better Lawmaking’ being some sort of Trojan horse to undermine Europe, the intention is it should strengthen Europe and make it more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I welcome your initiative, it is an excellent one. But I am a little sad to see that the debate we have had in Parliament was derailed, in the sense that we immediately started to talk about process: why did you not come with the paper to us first? Well, you have come to us, and we see it right here. It is a very good initiative. There is nothing new in this, it is part of improved regulation and it is something that we urgently needed, especially after the French and the Dutch referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have understood you correctly, you are going to withdraw 70 initiatives, which are: firstly, old; secondly, based on an impact assessment; or thirdly, based on subsidiarity. If that is the case, I am all for it. I can say this even though I sit at this end of the table. I am a federalist, I want more Europe, but I want less and better regulation. The problem with the European Parliament today is that we are putting up too many barriers and we should not do that. We need more freedom.</p>

We are concerned not only that there should be no erosion of social and economic standards, but also that bureaucracy should be kept to a minimum, that regulations should be as simple as possible and be readable – not, perhaps, so much by the general public as by the experts, which these days they are not. We will also be discussing this with representatives of the national parliaments. I have just heard that there is to be a meeting of COSAC at the beginning of October, and this will certainly be on the agenda for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have a specific question for you, Commissioner, and it is this: are you willing to make available to this House all the documentation on the basis of which you have drawn up this list, so that we may gain an insight into your motivation and your reasoning, and may then consider them when we give our own opinion? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not intend to discuss what should be done about the involvement of the press. This is the first step in the right direction; it is courageous and it is the right thing to do. We must give it our backing and encourage the Commission to move on to the ‘main course’, for that we regard as crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two suggestions to make. The first has to do with the small business sector, to which the Commissioner referred. Where better lawmaking is concerned, I can only hope that representatives of the small and medium-sized business sector will be included among the external groups of experts whose advice is to be sought. The fact is that industry can certainly cope with and accept certain aspects of regulation, but local small businesses and local craftsmen may well not be able to, and will go bust. So I ask, I appeal, as a matter of urgency, that these external groups give small and medium-sized enterprises the representation they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that complaints from the national level about over-regulation are a regular occurrence, and it often turns out that, rather than the over-regulation originating from Europe, its cause is in fact to be found in the complicated way in which the Member States transpose it. What is needed is the boldness to highlight the perverse ways in which European rules are sometimes applied and bring in a benchmark to indicate who is acting in such a way as to benefit the public and who is doing it in such a way as to inconvenience them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me take the timetable first: the Commission will come to a decision about the methodology and organisational principles of the great ‘Better Regulation’ project at the end of October. I will be putting to it an action plan for an initial three-year period in the hope that we will be able to get most of the project completed in that time.</p>
<p class="contents">We will in any case have to decide what our priorities are, and we will do so in such a way that we start with the areas that there is reason to believe really are over-regulated by reason of the vast amount of legislation. We have already decided that sectors such as the automobile industry, the construction industry and waste management should be the first to be examined, with all the other sectors to follow on.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this, Commissioner Fischer Boel is already working on a fundamental programme for the simplification of the agricultural <span class="italic">acquis</span>, the first package of which will be able to be presented this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am much obliged to Mr Swoboda for his support, and can tell him that I can give him the documents he needs right now, as I already have them to hand for him and for the other groups too. These documents will show you what stage the various projects had reached and the reasons why the Commission thinks they should be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might make another brief observation concerning the media. Right now, I have no desire to bore the House or to torment it, but I could well, here and now, read out a list of the occasions on which I have appeared before it to inform it about this project. The first was as long ago as September 2004 – even before I was appointed. I have spoken to your House about this matter on a total of 11 occasions. Initial information was given to your House before the public heard even a word about it – although I do assume that the plenary of the European Parliament can be regarded as representing the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I do indeed insist that I have acted with absolute correctness as regards informing the European Parliament. Until this afternoon, and indeed until I stood up to speak here, neither I nor any of my staff gave the media any information about what is in the list. I have a certain reputation to maintain where my respect for your House is concerned, and so I hope I have made that perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">You will, of course, be given all this in black and white. Even though the Commission is entitled to decide independently of anyone else what to do with this list, I think it highly advisable to wait and see what advice we get from Parliament and to act on it when implementing what is decided. The Commission has agreed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the final question, for which I am extremely grateful, my concern about the economic future of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe was one of the reasons why I proposed this project in the first place. I am perfectly well aware that big business and major firms can handle regulation with relative ease; they can afford to have their own departments to deal with it. The smaller a company is, though, the more burdensome it finds the costs involved in dealing with red tape and the more difficult it is for it to plan and make investments and actually achieve some growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, then, assure you that the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises will be considered in all that we do. The external expertise on which we will draw will of course include that of the representatives of the small business sector. Our future policy on small and medium-sized enterprises is due to be announced in a communication in only a few weeks’ time, and there will be a great deal in that, too, about the issue of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am just as grateful for what you have had to say about transposition at national level. There are indeed some quite fascinating examples of how Member States have managed to take a short, clear and straightforward European directive and turn it into a bureaucratic monster with many times the number of words needed. There is a splendid English expression for this: ‘gold plating’. Part of this project, to my mind, has to do with us explaining to the European public that this sort of thing has to stop, and that European legislation cannot be used as a sort of protective screen behind which nation states run their pet projects and do things that they would not dare to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I think, should answer all your questions. I am grateful for the political support offered to me by three of your speakers, and offer you close and trusting cooperation in this project, which will have a particular impact on all three institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have always felt that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission might look again at another physical agents directive, the electromagnetic fields directive, and how it will affect MRI scanners, in terms of bringing in static magnetic fields. We need health and safety legislation, yes; but only when it is necessary at EU level and when it cannot be done at Member State level. For instance I would like to see a specific directive on needlestick injuries. I would like, under Article 13, to see a specific directive on age and on disability. Nevertheless I welcome what the Commission is saying. There is unnecessary regulation and, speaking as a pro-European, I think it does us more harm than good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all very well to withdraw a few directives; indeed there are some that we would really love to see withdrawn, such as the Bolkestein directive, but unfortunately it is still there.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns us, however, is the emphasis given to this exercise, which is absolutely uncalled-for, because trying to win the people over by undoing what has been done seems to us to be rather questionable, to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, after you have seen and listened to industry, I would really urge you to go and meet the consumers’ association as well, as they uphold people’s rights and environmental rights. I am sure that you will meet people who will tell you that competitiveness is much more than what you have been trying to propose to us, alas, for about a year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that in connection with the impact assessment question and other topics that you have raised here, such as screening, there are outstanding problems that may seem innocent enough but unfortunately are not: just look at the demolition job that you – you yourself and the Commissioner and President Barroso – are performing on REACH and have already performed on the pollution strategy.

Clearly, we would like there to be less pernickety bureaucracy and we would like to give business a bit of air.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is your vision for cooperation with the European Parliament, which is a co-legislator? Even though it is not provided for in the Treaty, in view of the interinstitutional agreement, how do you see the participation of our parliamentary committees? With regard to the impact assessment, which we called for, it must not turn into automatic justification for the Commission’s proposal or into justification for doing nothing. What will happen, also, to the impact assessment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to simplification, which is very important, we must take care that it does not lead to deregulation. Meddling with the Community acquis in the field of social affairs, the environment or consumer protection could lead to social dumping. We will therefore be very vigilant. Better law-making does not have to mean fewer laws. What place is given to standardisation? The European Parliament draws its legitimacy from codecision.

I am able to inform you that I have invited the Member States, the business associations, the consumers’ groups, the trade unions and all members of the European public to submit their own proposals to us, and these have been coming in in their hundreds, many of them very detailed and very precise. What this tells me is that this project really does enjoy widespread support.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Frassoni’s question, I would like to say that this is something I have tried to explain. It strikes me as being an issue of political trust. As I have said, and as I will emphasise once again, the object of the exercise is not to alter the quality of the <span class="italic">aquis</span> in any particular section. The initiative is not intended to deregulate in the sense in which the radical ideologues of the free market use the term, but to simplify the existing system of legislation, making it more transparent and more user-friendly. In saying this, I am saying, as I have already said in your hearing on numerous occasions, that the European model actually consists in balancing growth and employment, social cohesion and sustainable development, and that is something of which we are not, of course, going to let go. Mrs Frassoni can take my word for it: nothing like what she fears will actually happen, and none of the standards we have already achieved will be made less rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Grossetête, I can say that Parliament’s rights of participation will of course be retained. I think that one of the consequences of the simplification project will even be that Parliament will be able to avail itself of rights in ways that it could not have done originally, as we will be resubmitting acts that were adopted at a time when there was as yet no codecision in the areas to which they apply. I believe that what we do will enhance Parliament’s rights of codecision, and the Commission is of course willing to report to all the committees on what happens.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole question of the impact assessment is a difficult one, and one that I did have something to say about. For its own part, the Commission has decided that it will no longer be making proposals before a comprehensive assessment of the costs resulting from them has been carried out. Although that is an internal procedure within the Commission, we will present you with the results from it at the same time as we forward proposals to you. Speaking personally, I take the very definite view that a further impact assessment will of course be needed if the legislator does what it is there to do and makes substantial changes to the Commission proposal. That, though, is a decision for you yourselves to take, for it is you, and not the Commission, that are the legislative body; if you say that you can adopt an act even without an impact assessment, then that is your decision and your responsibility. I would, however, advise that we should, together, look for a way in which we can come up with a generally acceptable method of assessing the impact of legislation. I think we can actually be very proud of the fact that the impact assessment developed by the Commission has an extremely good reputation internationally, and, while I do not believe that you will find anything better anywhere in the public sphere, there is still room for improvement, and that is something we can work on together. I do indeed agree with Mrs Grossetête that we do not necessarily need less lawmaking, but that lawmaking does need to be better in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that we are talking here about two different things. One is the great project of simplification, which will indeed result in a marked reduction in the volume – mark well, the quantity, rather than the quality – of the <span class="italic">aquis</span>. The actual result of the other project, the new method whereby we draft legislation, will be a significant increase in its quality, and you, the Members of the European Parliament, being the people who make the laws, will be enabled to arrive at a very precise account of the costs and benefits of every individual decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He claims that ‘it is an appetiser’, but we would be wrong to think that this is merely cosmetic. I think that the Commission’s proposals do have teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite extraordinary – with all due respect to the Commissioner – for bureaucracy to come up with proposals for less bureaucracy. So turkeys may be able to vote for Christmas after all. The Commissioner is right to give Parliament and the Council some of the responsibility, since it is from this House and the Council that much of the small print in legislation originates.</p>

<p class="contents">I really must say that Mrs Schroedter is wrong in making what is in fact an insinuation. The withdrawal of proposals that have not even yet been adopted cannot be said to dismantle anything. It cannot do anything to change what is actually law. I am talking here about proposals that the European Parliament has not even yet adopted, and the Commission will, in every single instance, be giving a precise explanation of why it is withdrawing them. I made a point of adding that this does not mean that we will not be bringing these matters back to your House.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards temporary workers, we suggest that Parliament should not wind up its deliberations before the Commission has presented more comprehensive economic analyses and an extensive impact assessment. The proposal has not been withdrawn, and I have no idea whence you have that information. You must not believe everything you read in the newspapers; I would appreciate it if our deliberations were to relate only to what the Commission has officially communicated to you in its proposal. What matters is not what the newspapers print, but what the Commission has decided this afternoon. To Mr Maaten, I want to say I had no intention of making a ceremony of my statement; I mentioned the hour of the day only because I wanted to demonstrate to you that, as soon as the Commission had agreed on its resolution, the European Parliament – and nobody else – was informed about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
