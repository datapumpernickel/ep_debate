<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, given the situation in the region, let me begin with the crisis that is unfolding in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have to say how appalled all Members of this House and all of us are by the sickening violence that we continue to witness in Syria. Security forces and militias have bombarded cities with no regard for citizens. There have been massacres and point-blank killings. We have seen this last week in a village near Hama, and the week before in Houla, where security forces and militias killed men, women and children. Those responsible for these crimes must ultimately be held to account and we must focus on doing everything we can to stop this bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at a critical moment. The situation is deteriorating day by day as the regime’s behaviour reinforces the most radical elements on all sides. And yet most ordinary Syrians long for the transition that would avoid bloodshed, keep the country together and respect minorities. If the descent into further militarisation continues, it will spell terrible disaster not only for the people of Syria, but also for the broader region – I am thinking especially of Lebanon – where developments are extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have discussed with Kofi Annan – over recent weeks and most lately on Friday – we must spare no effort to avoid a catastrophe. Assad has no place in the future of Syria. His regime fails to comply with its own commitments and every day underlines its lack of legitimacy. The implementation of Kofi Annan’s plan is certainly not easy and its viability has been questioned. But despite all the challenges, it remains today the best way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act decisively to prevent further bloodshed, while avoiding fuelling the flames of sectarian violence. The only way forward is first of all to reinforce Kofi Annan’s leverage with the Syrian regime and to try to make the mission more effective. No other option has been able to gather together any kind of international support. I do pay tribute to Kofi Annan for his extraordinary efforts in exceedingly difficult conditions. He has the support and legitimacy of the international community through the United Nations and, of course, through the Arab League. Secretary-General Ban-Ki moon told the General Assembly on Thursday that this plan must remain the centrepiece of our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">But that alone is not enough. We need to do much more to further isolate the regime, build real and operational international consensus, strengthen international sanctions and press the government towards compliance and transition. As Kofi Annan himself has made very clear, all concerned – and, in particular, the Members of the UN Security Council and those who have influence on the regime and on Russia and China in particular – must unite and apply more effective pressure to move forward to a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to agree on a road map that reinforces Kofi Annan and the plan and that involves, I would argue, three key priorities: firstly, a more effective contact group that includes Russia and China, to coordinate support for Kofi Annan and exert influence on the regime. I therefore welcome the idea of a contact group of key actors on the Syrian crisis announced by Kofi Annan last Thursday in the UN Security Council. The international community has to show unity in this critical moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, united action by the UN Security Council to add more robust and effective pressure, including the reinforcement of sanctions under Chapter VII and, thirdly, international consensus around a political process and transition.</p>
<p class="contents">With those three priorities in mind, I have engaged with Kofi Annan and other leaders to try to seek a new consensus, including meeting last week in Istanbul, where I attended a special meeting on Syria, and at the EU-Russia Summit the weekend before.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on the political process cannot wait. It is crucial for the credibility of the international efforts and to show the people of Syria that there is a path leading to a better, rather than a more fragmented, Syria. But for this to happen, the opposition must finally come together and put its differences aside. Frankly, new leadership is not enough. A stronger and more united opposition that represents a credible alternative for all Syrians is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed ongoing efforts with Turkey and we are coordinating closely with the Arab League. We continue to meet the different factions and groups in the opposition. Now we are working on two seminars that will feed into the Arab League plans to organise a larger meeting with them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to our sanctions, diplomatic efforts and support to the UN Mission, which are appreciated by the UN, humanitarian assistance remains a top priority for the EU. Innocent civilians and children are paying the price of this crisis. I am working closely with Commissioner Georgieva to use all the tools we have at our disposal to deliver our assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already allocated over EUR 28 million to address the humanitarian needs inside Syria and its neighbouring countries. We need the Syrian Government to implement the agreed comprehensive humanitarian response plan without any more excuses or delays.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Commission approved EUR 23 million in special measures – I had previously announced that in this plenary and it has now been approved – to support civil society within Syria and neighbouring countries who are supporting Syrian refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">While I was in Istanbul last week, our Crisis Coordinator engaged with the Turkish authorities and visited the camps on Turkey’s borders. We offered further help to Turkey, as needed. I believe that Turkey is doing a great job in dealing with the refugees, and they can count on our support as they continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to call for accountability and support UN efforts in this regard. This is something that we owe to the victims. The UN is investigating the latest massacres and the Human Rights Council – with our full support – is setting up a Committee of Investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have decided to withdraw and expel Ambassadors. Our Delegation in Damascus will remain open for as long as possible. This has been the request of many honourable Members and, more importantly, of the Syrians themselves. They are our ears, eyes and hands to help on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might, I will now turn to the Middle East peace process where our objective remains the same. I have been very clear from the beginning of what we call the Arab Spring or Arab Awakening that developments in the region make the peace process and a negotiated solution even more urgent and important, not less. While we have to pay – and should pay – great attention to events in Syria, Egypt and elsewhere, ending the conflict remains a key priority and a fundamental European Union interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Quartet continue efforts to facilitate contacts between the parties, to resume direct and substantive talks, in line with the statements the Quartet has made, both in September last year and April of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned in this House the work of Jordan and, in particular, I thank His Majesty King Abdullah II and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Judeh for their good offices in fostering the conditions to try to see the resumption of these negotiations. We are working closely with them to do everything we can to facilitate the process and I hope the 14 May Foreign Affairs Council conclusions demonstrated to all the strong and principled position of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have welcomed the recent exchange of letters between the parties and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s statement that the new Israeli Government will try to advance ‘a responsible peace process’. We want the parties to build on positive exchanges and resume direct talks.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain unequivocally committed to the security of Israel, including with regard to vital threats in the region. We have condemned all forms of violence against civilians, including the rocket attacks from Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">But the truth is that while the Middle East peace process is not making the progress we all want, the prospects for a two-state solution are being undermined by developments on the ground. Proposals for new settlements around East Jerusalem, the lack of Palestinian involvement in Area C, the growth of settlements in the West Bank, settler violence and the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority all threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="contents">EU Foreign Ministers at the last Foreign Affairs Council expressed a clear and strong consensual position in our conclusions, forging a common EU approach to developments on the ground. This was an important step forward. Insisting on the need to respect international and humanitarian law is absolutely consistent with our friendship with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Settlements remain the key and most serious concern. Only last week, I deplored the Israeli Government’s plans to build over 800 additional settlement housing units. Settlement expansion has to be condemned because these are illegal under international law and put current peace efforts at risk. I want to reiterate my call on the Israeli Government to exercise the highest sense of responsibility by reversing these decisions, in full respect of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, unless they are agreed by both parties. Plans for major settlement expansion around the city’s southern flank risk cementing this, and the prospect of Jerusalem as the future capital for both states is being further undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards settlement products, EU Foreign Ministers underlined the need to work with the Commission to ensure EU legislation is implemented effectively and with as much transparency as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We will follow up on the Council conclusions, also seeking progress with regard to Area C for the benefit of the Palestinian population – a pressing issue that was the focus of our discussions at the last Ad Hoc Liaison Committee I hosted in Brussels. I believe development of Area C is critical to the viability of a future Palestinian state. Israel needs to help and facilitate this with concrete and pragmatic steps. We are also really concerned by recent and increasing incidents of settler violence, which we all condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">The precarious state of the Palestinian Authority’s finances is an issue. I have been engaged with them from the beginning of my mandate, working closely with Foreign Minister Støre of Norway. I want to thank Parliament again for its principled and constructive position with regard to the EU budget as I continue to urge countries in the region, and others, to share the burden and increase their support.</p>
<p class="contents">On the humanitarian front, of course, the most pressing situation is in Gaza. I have visited three times since taking office, so my message and our support are clear. We need to open the crossings in Gaza as the best way of improving the well-being of the people and to see goods and people move freely. On the political front, I recognise the concrete progress on the reconciliation which President Abbas has engaged in.</p>
<p class="contents">But I want to stress again that the EU’s involvement in the region is also defined by its commitment to human rights, which must be respected by both parties. We will continue to address these issues in the context of our bilateral relations at all levels. I have been really concerned at reports of Palestinian Authority restrictions on freedom of speech and have urged both sides to deal effectively with acts of incitement. The extensive use of administrative detention is a key concern we raise at every opportunity.</p>

We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops.</p>
<p class="contents">These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I do not completely agree with Mr Salafranca’s idea today of military presence, or at least, we would need to agree upon what we call military presence in the sense that there are currently observers in place whose mandate could possibly be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the temptation of military intervention in this part of the world is so great – given that on one side of Syria you have Lebanon, half of which is in support of Bashar al-Assad, that you have Iran close by, with Iraq next door, and given the destabilisation and terrorism which will undoubtedly occur in the region – that we are truly faced with a dilemma. For the time being, aside from the extremely strong political pressure and aside from the humanitarian pressure with regard to which some progress has been made today, I believe that the impact of military intervention would be much more disastrous.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Baroness Ashton, I should like to ask you some questions. Part of the solution, or part of the problem rather, lies with Russia. An EU-Russia Summit was held: what was Russia’s response? They proposed that an international conference be held on Syria and that Iran be included: what is your reaction to that? What was said in relation to arms and Russia? That, after all, is one of our main areas of concern with regard to Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, aside from the Annan plan which has been strengthened with deadlines and the handing over of power, even by leaving Bashar al-Assad in the shadows, I personally fear a proxy war, as we would say, that is to say, foreign forces battling in a religious war. Moreover, I would add, unfortunately, that while Bashar al-Assad is illegitimate in our eyes because of the crimes he has committed and for which he will be held responsible, he is still not perceived as illegitimate by at least 50% of the population, if not more. We must today be wary of the support for Bashar al-Assad, whether this be down to conviction or down to the fear of chaos and a religious war.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Israel and Palestine – and I see that I have gone over my time – we must address the issue at another time, during which we will discuss the colonies again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sensitivities, or rather the temperaments, of some of my colleagues in my group might be different, some more inclined to intervene more quickly, others more aware of – well everybody is aware of – all the complexities of the situation, but according to our temperaments, some might or might not demand quicker interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal hopes are, High Representative, that the course you have chosen brings improvements and contributes to halting the horrors which are ongoing and that we finally see the departure of a leader who certainly, morally, has become completely illegitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few things now about the Arab Spring, or what we call the Arab Spring. Of course, no two situations are alike and the situation in each of those countries is different. Myself, being a special friend of, or having a special tender feeling for Morocco, I am sometimes a little bit concerned that it might be overlooked because everything is going too smoothly, so to say, and that would be a pity. But that is not the most important thing right now.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, what I would like to warn against is excessive pessimism. The elections might not have given all the results we would have hoped for, but at least in most of the countries where they took place, they have taken place in rather satisfactory circumstances, although there are question marks about the way things have gone in Algeria. I believe that the people in those countries deserve our continuing support, and one of the worst things we could do is turn our backs on them because they have not one hundred percent voted the way we would have ideally liked them to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the Middle East, there are two short things I would like to say: first of all, it should be clear to everybody that my entire political group is excessively committed to the possibility for Israel to develop in a secure way. At the same time, we are just as committed to seeing a two-state solution and very worried at seeing how this is becoming, on the ground, more and more difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The picture we get from Syria every day is more and more desperate. Let me reiterate that any leader who treats his people in this way – no matter how big his support might be, and I even doubt the 50% – can have any legitimacy in our view.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three issues we would like you to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, strengthen the local and internal opposition to pave the way for political transition. As you have mentioned to some extent, we need to support the internal opposition, the local committees – many of whom are working towards and form the diversity of the opposition movement – to help them build stronger links and, if necessary, to arrange meetings outside Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, we need a political solution based on such an increase in internal coherence. I think you were right to mention the contact group; you mentioned Russia and China. Can I also ask for Iran to be included? I know there are some opposing voices inside the UN and US, but I think we need them to be a part of this if we want to have a solution, because they are part of the problem right now. We need to rethink our position there.</p>
<p class="contents">If you find such a contact group and possibly a solution, I think we need to back that up much more strongly than with the current UN mission. We need not hundreds, we need thousands; we need a full UN peacekeeping mission and I think it would be high time to prepare for it now. We know how long it takes for it to be effectively deployed on the ground. Ms Ashton, I call on you to prepare this now; to get it ready, so that in time of need, we can deploy it rapidly and have a full-on mission on the ground, and not just a few hundred.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear, I am not calling for a UN mandate for international intervention as is the case in Libya, but for a peacekeeping mission inside Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point. You were talking about Russia. Are we ready to put all the incentives and sanctions on the table that are needed to convince the Russians to allow for the downfall of Assad? What is it that we are really putting on a table? What price are we willing to pay to get Russia on board? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Damascus has turned its paramilitary thugs against its own citizens. The so-called ‘shabiha’ are beyond control and are increasingly acting with total impunity. Their atrocities have actually shocked the international community and are reminiscent in my view of the unspeakable atrocities of the Balkans 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the rapidly deteriorating situation, it is clear now that the Annan Plan has sadly failed, so Russia must now step up and use its unique leverage on Damascus to effect change and reverse its Security Council veto, thus unblocking the path for robust international action on Syria to prevent further bloodshed and pave the way, hopefully, for a democratic regime change with al-Assad well gone.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia must be aware that its credibility now is seriously at stake in the Arab world. China will surely follow the Russian lead. Clearly, the international community must now look to the Arab League for guidance, but I am not sure about Saudi Arabia and Qatar alone, because they are not entirely credible in my view as they are not true democracies and they are far too close politically speaking, and even arming the salafists. The Syrian National Council must now be more united. We must work on that, so all options are open to the West, including now an arms embargo and even limited military intervention to protect further civilian atrocities. All this must remain on the table to avert further descent into an all-out sectarian civil war, or even Rwanda or Srebrenica-style genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also consider proposing a fresh resolution in the Security Council to indict al-Assad and his henchmen before the ICC. Turkey, of course, is a key player and, ultimately, is a democracy with the military might to intervene, if it so wishes, at its borders, to impose a humanitarian safe corridor if necessary. Iran, which is dragging its feet, as you well know High Representative, with the EU and the IAEA over nuclear negotiations, will do everything it can to support its Damascus ally and its proxy Hezbollah, but the EU has no interest whatsoever, Ms Brantner, in supporting either of these two brutal regimes. Iran does not belong in the contact group, I am sorry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was told this shocking fact earlier this week by a good friend, a knowledgeable Arabist, who is stationed in Damascus. Meanwhile, the Alawite minority in Syria, approximately 3 million people, fear outright genocide if the current Assad regime is overthrown. This is not a figment of my imagination, because hate preachers, such as Adnan al-Arour, have openly been calling for this from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, how does the European Union assess this Syrian nightmare? At the same time, I would ask you, if you have not done so already, to challenge Saudi Arabia about the spreading of inflammatory language through satellites from Saudi territory. I was told yesterday by reliable Syrian sources that Salafist rebels are now so heavily armed that they control whole neighbourhoods and even entire towns.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been conclusively documented for the Christian neighbourhoods in Homs and the towns of Rastan and Qusair. Following Homs, some 10 000 Christian citizens from Qusair, having had to abandon all their possessions, were last week expelled by armed rebels.

Alongside those opposition activists who are demanding reforms, there are others who will clearly only be satisfied with the fall or removal of President Assad. In addition, ultra-religious factions are increasingly getting involved, and they now sense an opportunity to found an Islamist state. The fact that Syria plays an important strategic role in the region makes things more complicated still. The multi-religious tensions are being intensified by ethnic conflicts. These are carried over into already unstable neighbouring countries by refugees, and the result could be the development of something like a conflagration.</p>
<p class="contents">As a failure of the peace plan is, I would argue, conceivable, it is important, at any event, to keep turning up the pressure on Syria. A military intervention, however, could cause more harm than good, in my view. This is because, unlike in Libya, there is no clear front between the regime and the rebels that could be defended. Rather, the whole thing is slowly sliding into a mass slaughter in individual city districts.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there is no unified political opposition is a further cause of confusion. The example of Libya has shown us that a fall of the regime would not necessarily lead to an improvement in the human rights situation. If radical Islamists get into power after the fall of the regime, there could be a real threat of bloodbaths, given the prevailing ethnic tensions, and that is something that, from the European Union’s side, we should definitely prevent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lady Ashton, I must say I was very pleased with the Council’s conclusions of 14 May, because the parties involved are saying that they should refrain from actions that undermine the credibility of the peace process and they are also voicing their concerns regarding the developments on the ground that are making the two-state solution impossible, such as the Israeli settlement policy, which is in violation of international law. They are also really making themselves heard on the subject of the poor living conditions of the Palestinians in Area C.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also something that I am missing in the Council conclusions because, if the two-state solution is not achieved, what will happen next? What lever will we have if these diplomatic and practical initiatives do not lead to an effective peace process? What are we going to do as the European Union? How can we enforce a solution? How long will the commitment of a credible mediator still be credible if the parties do not comply with the agreements made?</p>
<p class="contents">We and, in particular, the European Union, must do everything to bring political pressure to bear on the parties. We are Israel’s most important trading partner, but we are also the largest sender of aid to the Palestinian Authority. I believe that it is definitely time that we started using the levers because a community of values like the European Union can no longer afford to rely on a hands-off approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning briefly to Syria. What are we doing and what will the European Union do to persuade Russia, and China, too, to a lesser extent, to collaborate with the embargo? It seems to me to be the only way to ensure that we can prevent the civil war that all of us can see coming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bashar al-Assad and his henchmen and women, if they survive, will have to face international justice for crimes against humanity and war crimes against their people, but ominous responsibility also lies with their backers, Russia and China in particular, who continue to sell weapons to the regime and block action in the UN Security Council to stop the bloodshed, thus boycotting, in practice, the Annan Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The incapacity of the UN Security Council to call for the international community to exercise their responsibility to protect the Syrian people is making the bloody conflict become a civil war, dramatically impacting a region already plagued by conflict. Lady Ashton, I fully second your words urging the Israeli authorities to stop the illegal settlement activity and move towards genuine peace with Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar should also be warned by the UN Security Council, and certainly by the European Union, about their interference in instigating the sectarian bloodshed by conducting their own proxy war in Syria at the expense of the Syrian people.</p>
<p class="contents">To the brave Syrians resisting at home and abroad, I can only, in all honesty, say that they must not wait for international action, should guard themselves from being used by extremists and terrorists and must lose no time in getting united under a platform for national salvation to overthrow the tyrant regime and move towards a new era of democratic conviviality among all ethnic and religious segments of the Syrian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The crisis that has lasted for the past 15 months has turned Syria into a genuine battlefield, where thousands of innocent people have been killed.

<p class="contents">I believe that the international community has the obligation to step up and consider all possible measures that can put an end to this horrific power struggle.

I fully support that focus, but I want to say something in addition about the Middle East. The European Union has, indeed, been the biggest sender of aid to the Palestinians for some years but, time and again, we have seen our efforts cancelled out by actions from the Israeli side.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Ms Oomen-Ruijten, I, too, am pleased with the latest decisions from the Foreign Affairs Council on the Middle East. They have really touched on the heart of the matter given Israel’s subsequent prickly reaction which means that we definitely hit the right spot. Obviously, these words look great on paper, but I keep asking myself the following question: what should the EU do to really contribute to the peace process?</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I have a very specific question about the Quartet: what do you think about the proposal put forward by the Arab League to include them in the Quartet and make it into a Quintet? I know that the United States are blocking that move but what does the EU think? Perhaps this could provide new momentum! And, better still, perhaps the UN Security Council should again be directly charged with managing the peace process given that we did not get anywhere with Mr Blair’s mediation mission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is a dictator and he is behaving in exactly the same way as any dictator would to maintain his power and keep his money, irrespective of the ideology – be it right-wing, left-wing, nationalist or religious – that is used for this purpose. History has shown that any dictator of this kind will do everything he can to stay in power. President Assad is going further than some of the bloodiest dictators. To stay in power, he is murdering innocent children and civilians. I believe that the right place for President Assad is in front of the International Criminal Court, as it must now be said loudly and clearly that President Assad is a criminal who has committed crimes against his own nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the issue that we should find the most worrying is that a country that is an important partner for the European Union and is our neighbour, namely Russia, is supporting the Assad regime for entirely cynical reasons.

Indeed, the terrible crimes against the civilian population attributed to both the Syrian Government and the opposition, need to be rigorously and impartially investigated in order to convict those responsible. Those crimes should not, however, give rise to military intervention such as in Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. Those three military interventions made the world much less safe: the proof of the pudding is in the eating. An example of this is Afghanistan, which we do not know how to get out of, and where the Taliban have no less control than they did before the intervention.</p>

I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections?</p>
<p class="contents">In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is happening beyond our borders requires an appropriate response capacity, and frankly I do not think even the European Union as a whole has sufficient response capacity to meet the challenges facing us. How long must we stand and watch the massacre in Syria?</p>
<p class="contents">We can understand all the current difficulties resulting from the fragile balance of power in the region; we can understand, yet not agree with, the positions of Russia and China, who will not allow the United Nations to take more incisive action; and we can also understand the mistrust in certain spheres in Europe towards the forces opposing Bashar al-Assad, not least because of their sources of funding. However, we cannot tolerate what is happening any longer. The European Union should go beyond its current activism and take a stronger lead. We have to disprove the idea that the Assad regime can do what it likes because the international community has shown itself to be impotent and that the European Union is too tied up in the economic and financial crisis to allow itself the luxury of intervening in the events in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to create a humanitarian corridor has not been put into practice. I think, though, we should make a fresh start on that and back up that decision with all the means at our disposal, bar none – and I stress, bar none – because that is a vital prerequisite for initiating the transition process and the transfer of power. We now need to turn our words into actions, and that is a task that is clearly yours to shoulder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A ghastly human tragedy is unfolding: in Haffa, in Houla, in Hreitan, women and children are being shot at random, and children are being tortured – and allegedly even used as human shields. Violence is rife and, despite her attempt to revive its corpse, the Annan Plan is dead.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Syria has air defences much stronger than those of Libya; true, the opposition there is weak and divided, and nowhere in control. Indeed, troops will be needed on the ground. High Representative, this is no longer a time for seminars. The right to intervene and the responsibility to protect are part of UN doctrine. Ban Ki-moon can call on NATO or others to intervene, and on the International Criminal Court to investigate. You should urge him to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only yesterday, another one hundred people, many of them children, are estimated to have died across the country in this conflict that is sliding right into outright civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">The origins of the uprising in Syria as a genuine popular movement against the al-Assad police state and against the rule of the crooked elite have been increasingly forgotten by all of the dominant forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Sectarianism is deepening and there is a real danger of a conflict based on sectarian lines spilling over into other countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, it is working people, the poor and children who suffer the most and the crocodile tears of sympathy from the imperialist powers, in my opinion, are deeply sickening, deeply hypocritical considering that the day after the Houla massacre, a NATO drone strike in Afghanistan killed eight members of one family.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the US is using the failure of the so-called six-point peace plan to threaten action outside of it. One thing needs to be very clear: any military intervention, regardless of how it is dressed up, regardless of how it is disguised, will not ease the suffering of the Syrian people. The answer can only be a movement that unites working and poor people in Syria, regardless of religious and ethnic background, which can meet the aspirations of the participants in the uprising of March 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the international community has not been entirely silent, frustration and powerlessness must be the words that best describe its feelings regarding the situation in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">It is distressing that all we can do is read the reports by UN military observers on the ever-growing numbers of civilian victims, and the continuous bloodshed and human rights violations. They report that Syrian Government troops are carrying out planned attacks on civilians. In other words, the purpose is to kill civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, for the first time, the United Nations has added Syrian Government troops to the list of those who recruit, kill and exploit children in armed conflicts. It is quite clear that the EU must use all the influence it has with Russia and China. However, the Arab countries also have a crucial role to play, especially Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Syria is causing growing uncertainty throughout the region. In Lebanon, for example, the army has now managed to end the violence against religious groups. The Alawites and Sunnis have been fighting one another, and it is particularly the supporters of al-Assad and his opponents who have been involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that 78 000 people have fled to neighbouring countries. I would like to ask the Commissioner what the international community can do in this situation to help the refugees that have escaped to neighbouring countries and to support the coordination of humanitarian assistance in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the window for a two-state solution is closing rapidly as the peace process is faltering. Israel continues to develop and construct illegal settlements – illegal under international law – on the West Bank. Planning and zoning laws have been used with impunity to dispossess the Palestinian people of East Jerusalem and destroy infrastructure throughout the West Bank, often built with EU funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Mining and quarrying activities deemed also to be illegal under international law are continuing apace at a cost of 720 000 to the Palestinian authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Lady Ashton, I would like to ask you, how can we ensure that there are consequences for the breaches of international law? How can we preserve East Jerusalem as a future capital of two states? How can we ensure that there will be a cessation of evictions and demolitions in Area C? How can we prevent the spread of illegal settlements? And can we ensure the release of administrative detainees unless they have actually been charged with criminal offences under law?</p>

<p class="contents">On Syria, I welcome the High Representative. We have to ask ourselves what, in ten years’ time, we will tell the widows and parents whose children have been tortured to death and killed at point blank range. The new generation of Syrians who wish to fight for more freedom and justice need support. Europe was, can and should be a beacon of freedom, and this comes with responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to say that solutions in Syria are easy, but at least the EU needs to act as a global player and should be united. I urge you to set out a vision and a strategy and to take Member States along. When will the EU Member States really get behind a common foreign and defence policy if it is not in the face of this terrible violence and in this crucial moment in the Middle East?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear need for a new coalition of the willing to save lives and to ensure a transition to a Syria which does not fall into a domino pattern of revenge actions and sectarian war. Despite the weapon supplies and the less than responsible attitude we have seen so far, Russia must be part of the solution. I welcome the contact group you mentioned if it leads to action instead of distraction.</p>

I believe that it already is a civil war. The attacks on the civilian population and on women and children are absolutely unbearable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should be aware that we need a policy which enables us to isolate Assad from his own people. We must make it clear not to him, but to his followers, that he has no future. This is always what is needed to ensure that a system implodes. The specific task and the responsibility of China and Russia lie in this area. They must make their position clearer, so that Assad does not believe that he has a refuge there and that he can continue to hold out as he has been doing. It must be made obvious to his followers that they should distance themselves from him if they want to have a future, so that a peaceful solution can be reached within Syria, which is not possible with Assad in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also think that Qatar, Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries have a specific responsibility in this area. They are obviously supplying weapons and selectively funding the opposition, as they did during the elections in Egypt, with the aim of encouraging the Islamisation of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we make countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which always presents itself in an official context as a liberal state, publicly aware of their responsibilities, that we no longer accept the game that they are playing, that they take a specific responsibility in this area and that, in this way, we enable the Arab League to play a more effective role. In other words, we must involve the United Nations, China and Russia in order to achieve our first objective and make it clear that Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other countries have a responsibility. If we in the West decide to take military action, we must understand that the situation is quite different from that in Libya, both in terms of the population and the country’s geography. However, we should also make it clear that the rights of minorities must be safeguarded under all circumstances. The Christians in Syria are worried because they feel threatened by some parts of the opposition. We need to take this into account if we are to find a sensible solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several weeks ago, a delegation of ours visited Egypt and we were able to see the complex situation there for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware of the fact that, next week, in a second round of presidential elections, the Egyptian people will be asked to choose between two extremes: on the one hand, the old regime in the form of Mr Shafiq, Mr Mubarak’s former Prime Minister, and, on the other, the Muslim Brotherhood, whose position is becoming stronger as the party has already won the first round of the elections some months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this is frustrating and it is a very difficult dilemma for those who had hoped for a real change. Meanwhile, state coffers are lying empty and it is not clear how much real power the future president will have, because Egypt still needs a new constitution. All of this shows that the transition process is sluggish. Many people are looking at Egypt and wondering if they really will be able to pull it off. Probably, a great deal will depend on improving the economic situation for the average Egyptian because there are many people who are waiting for their situation to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">Lady Ashton, I would like to know your view on the situation in Egypt and the additional developments there, especially given the scepticism of a considerable number of political actors towards the ‘more for more’ principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, you referred for the umpteenth time to the fact that settlement building is illegal under the terms of international law. Furthermore, on 14 May, the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions on the peace process the fact that we must maintain the viability of a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is incomprehensible that we in the European Parliament are now being asked to vote in favour of the additional protocol to the association agreement with Israel on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA). I think it is particularly important to make the following point. We have not yet had a clear explanation of the precise way in which products manufactured in the settlements are handled in the agreement between the EU and Israel. These products are still finding their way onto the EU market. Before we conclude any further trade agreements with Israel, we need to resolve this problem. We must investigate whether there are any effective mechanisms for monitoring this which can be introduced and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, Israel continues to disregard its obligations under international law. More settlements are being built, enlarged and even relocated as Israel sees fit, while the EU stands helplessly by. A two-state solution is quite literally being buried under the settlements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to sit and watch football matches while knowing that every day, dozens of people are being killed in Syria and that it is not just soldiers, but also civilians, including women and children. I think everybody here has now realised that President Assad long ago ceased to be the hope of Europe or America as regards improving the human rights situation or democratisation and economic development in Syria. We are all aware of the fact that President Assad is, quite simply, murdering his own people. I expect that we also realise – I think that this is something of which we are becoming increasingly aware – that the time may soon be upon us when the only solution will be military involvement. I am not talking about what kind of involvement, its scope or the when and how, but merely that it could happen. Naturally, the agreement of the UN would be required for this, and for this reason I would like to address a question to the High Representative: what are the possibilities for a change in the Russian and Chinese positions? I also have another question, as I believe that there is another country in this region which is extremely significant and interested in a positive resolution to the Syrian situation, namely Turkey.

<p class="contents">Moreover, perhaps also the European Union – as part of the international community – as well as the United Nations, Kofi Annan and his plan, which has failed, will save ourselves from being condemned by the international community for failing in our duty to help the Syrian people, as I believe that is already the case.</p>

I agree with my fellow Members, as it is fortunately not often that we talk about such terrible things here. We should not be sparing with our words of condemnation, and not just for Assad but also for all those who support him, because those governments that are supporting President Assad are also committing a crime. We are faced with an appalling and terrible dictatorship in this very day and age. I also agree with all those who have said that we must use all available and acceptable methods to save people from death and suffering and to save the wonderful Syrian culture from destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet Syria has a neighbour, a country that is prospering, democratic and developing very well, and this neighbour is Israel. I heard a speech by President Perez where he spoke of assistance for the development of democracy, for economic growth and for the construction of a modern society in neighbouring countries. He was speaking in the context of the Arab Spring in North African countries. This would be the dream. I imagine that Palestine, the inhabitants of the West Bank, they too could provide assistance to neighbouring countries. Yet the failed and stalled peace process between Israel and Palestine constantly draws our attention away from these terrible events in the region. We talk about settlements, we talk about trade agreements and we talk about the destruction of humanitarian aid instead of speaking about how these two communities could provide added value in stabilising the region.

<p class="contents">What is going on in Syria is already a civil war. We should not be under any illusions.

<p class="contents">However, we must make it clear to Assad and his clan that there is no solution left for him. He cannot survive as president. He must be summoned before the International Criminal Court. We must ensure that the Syrian regime becomes increasingly isolated and the key to achieving this lies in Russia and China, but also in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We need to increase the pressure in these areas. The international community must make its views clearer and give its support to the UN.

Immense changes have taken place in this exceptionally troubled part of the world and a huge amount of chaos has followed these changes. It is possible that, at some time, something great will come out of this chaos, but at present, the chaos also involves great risks. Someone has switched off the magnetic poles. When they are working, we usually know which way is north and which way is south, we know who is good and who is evil, who is the aggressor and who is trying to defend themselves. Today, we cannot tell. The old world of Arab regimes has gone. It has gone and this last regime, the Syrian one, is also going; it is just a matter of time.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, can we do any more than support all those who are working in favour of democracy, who are creating some sort of foundations for peace? Can we do any more than support democrats in Israel and Palestine? Can we do any more than strive to make sure that parties to peace treaties, such as treaties with Egypt and those between Israel and Jordan, keep their promises? Let us remember that this is a time in which something that is stable, democratic and predictable is a value in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would warn all those who believe that Israeli settlements, which I do not support, are a threat to peace.

<p class="contents">Another issue which demonstrates this is the long lasting Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We in the EU remain committed to a two-state solution, as confirmed in recent Council conclusions on the Middle East peace process. However, current trends are deeply worrying, especially concerning the use of administrative detention by the Israeli Government, which is used to imprison Palestinians without charge or evidence against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Many prisoners are kept in isolated cells for 23 hours a day. Despite declarations from the Israeli Government to end administrative detention, this practice is still going on. This is unacceptable in a country claiming to uphold the rule of law. Ms Ashton, have you brought this issue up with your contacts in the region? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Gaza Strip is still an open-air prison. The EU and the United Nations are constantly providing more money to feed the people in Gaza and the Israeli army has destroyed aid projects set up by the EU in occupied Palestinian territory in recent years which cost EUR 50 million. The aim of these aid projects was to provide better living conditions for the Palestinians and they included schools, infrastructure and education projects. We owe it to our taxpayers in the EU to make it clear to the Israelis that this situation has to change and that Israel’s settlement policy must finally come to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Libyan crisis was a typical crisis that can only be solved through international intervention, with the Blue Helmets and with a large mandate to separate parties and to stop violence that comes mostly from tyrannical governments that will one day have to answer for these crimes to the international courts.</p>
<p class="contents">In tandem with this, we have violence by rebels using heavy armaments who are funded by foreign countries and who are armed through covert operations.

As is well known, documented and discussed, these same groups are financed, supported and armed by the United States and by various fundamentalist dictators, in a campaign of aggression, intervention and destabilisation that has been going on for more than a year. These are terrorist groups that form part of al-Qaeda, as Ban Ki-moon himself has admitted. The same al-Qaeda that served as the pretext for the US invasion of Afghanistan, and is now paving the way for the Member States and other client states to be able to invade Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign has not, it must be said, taken a particularly original form. Humanity has already witnessed the use of falsifications and conspiracies several times – Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – to justify bloody wars of aggression and occupation.

It is also a fact that Palestinian settlements are funded by the EU. However, in 2011, the Israeli army destroyed more than 60 Palestinian structures in the West Bank which were built using EU money. These included houses, wells and agricultural facilities. Infrastructure projects subsidised by the EU must not be destroyed under any circumstances because actions of this kind naturally give rise to reactions on both sides. The recipe for peace and stability in this region consists not of more money, but primarily of dialogue and mutual respect. The EU must once again put pressure on both sides in the conflict in this regard.

It is significant that none of these Members mentioned how many soldiers would be provided by Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom and all the other speakers’ countries for house-to-house fighting, which is what would be facing these troops in Syria. They also failed to say how much military equipment would be needed and what costs these countries would incur, some of which are currently in the process of making use of the rescue package. No one has said anything about who should pay for all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is highly characteristic of the entire debate. Furthermore, no one has referred to the fact that Syria is not on the Hindu Kush and that a war or an open military conflict in Syria would have quite different effects on the neighbouring regions, in particular, on Israel and Palestine, than is the case in Afghanistan.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, I am conscious that there are seven debates this evening, of which this is the fourth, but it is one where so much has been said that I feel I need to give a fairly detailed response. However, I shall try to do so briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever frustration and concern you feel, I promise you that that is magnified by the conversations which go on every hour of every day between ourselves – the Member States, with other countries in the region, with Kofi Annan, with Ban Ki-moon, and with all of those who are really desperately trying to find a way through in Syria. A way through that will enable the people to achieve first of all peace – a ceasefire – and then a transition to a government that will have their interests at heart, and that they have chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that we do is designed and geared to try to achieve that, so I understand your passion, and I share it. I understand your frustration, and I share it. But we really have got to think very carefully about how we try to achieve that outcome as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">While we have been debating, we know that a group of observers in Syria have been met by stone throwing, and it appears that they have been fired on and have retreated from an area in Syria. All the time that we are speaking, we are very conscious that the situation on the ground is as bad as it possibly can be.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to try to address three or four key areas that honourable Members have raised and give my response to them, while bearing in mind that finding solutions is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is on sanctions. Every day, we look at what more we can do to continue to put the economic pressure on the regime that prevents it from doing some of the things it would like, that demonstrates international concern and commitment, and that shows to those in Syria who may not yet have realised it that this regime is going to go, and that the international community and the EU are united in their response to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that we are supporting the arms embargo. We have asked all countries to observe this, and are working closely with the UN under Chapter 7.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Opposition, we speak to everybody at all levels – the Syrian National Council, the National Coordination Committee – and we are supporting the efforts led by the Arab League, and also what Turkey is doing to try to bring the opposition together. We have talked about umbrella groups, we have talked about representative groups: all manner of ideas to try and get some kind of cohesion and unity between the different groups about what it is they are trying to do. It is very challenging, and yet it is so necessary to be able to demonstrate and bring leadership for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Kofi Annan plan: well, you can declare it dead if you want to, but Kofi Annan has a mandate from the United Nations. He is trying to find ways to bring about his six-point plan and to think of alternative ways to bring the international community together, and I will continue to support him in those efforts until he says, or the United Nations says, that we have stopped doing that and we are moving on. That does not mean that he or I do not realise how difficult it is. I have had the good fortune to speak many times on the phone with him, and I know his frustration. I know how hard he is trying to make things work, but what he has asked us to do is to support him in the ways he is trying to bring everyone together, and I will do that.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the contact group that Kofi Annan is proposing to set up, he has not yet quite determined what its membership will be. So I do not know what is going to happen precisely, or who will be there. I will be there, and I know that Russia will be there; it will take place in Geneva on 30 June, and in between times, Kofi Annan is trying to build support to stop the civil war from getting worse and to try and at least achieve some unity of purpose to ensure influence in the region is targeted at trying to prevent that outcome. I think we should support him in that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have to make a really strong distinction between observers and peacekeepers: they are not the same thing. What we have on the ground are observers. They are not peacekeepers. Their mandate is limited to observation and, as we have just learned, they put themselves at risk in so doing. Kofi Annan worries a great deal that we do not make the distinction clear enough. If we are going to move to do anything involving peacekeepers, then we had better be absolutely clear what mandate it is that we are giving them and who is mandating them to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian army is 200 000 to 300 000 strong and well-armed, so talk of military action needs to be thought through extremely carefully in what is a very complex situation on the ground. We have to work step by step, and carefully, to try to resolve this situation peacefully. We have to put pressure on the regime; we have to get those who have influence to put pressure on the regime; we have to get the opposition to unite; we have to get a ceasefire that will hold – because until you have a ceasefire, you cannot keep the peace, because there is none – and we have to be clear and sure about what it is we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We, of course, raise this with all partners. At the EU-Russia Summit we talked about Syria, and we have expressed over and over again our desire to see Russia join the Security Council. That, again, is what some of the meetings I attended last week in Turkey were about, and what many of the dialogues are aimed at: getting us to the point where the maximum pressure is successfully brought to bear on trying to stop the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East process, I agree with much of what has been said. There is no request that I am aware of concerning the Arab League wanting to be a member of the Quartet, but the Arab peace initiative follow-up committee has met with the Quartet on a number of occasions and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so. But I do agree that regional involvement is very important. It is why we have been very clear in support of what Jordan has been trying to do, to act as broker between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">We do raise the issues of administrative detention, both publicly, in our statements, and in all the contacts that we have. Particular cases have been raised. Mahmoud Sarsak – for those who do not already know this – ended his hunger strike yesterday, on what was the 85th day. That has been reported to our delegation by the prison service there. But, of course, there are many people in detention and we have made clear to Israel our view that the issue is disproportionate and we need to have certainty about the future of those people.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk to Israel all the time. There is a constant flow of information to and from us, and a constant flow of contacts. We do recognise the importance of the security of Israel. We want Israel to be a successful country. We want a two-state solution that includes Israel, and we want to see Israel recognise its international obligations and move forward on the peace process in its own interest.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view, and I have made this clear to all of my Israeli contacts, to all the people I know there, that if you want a secure Israel, solving the issues between them and the Palestinians forms part of that security. That was never more true than now, with all the changes and challenges that are going on in the region, all the concerns that Israel has – not least about Iran – and all the changes too in the neighbourhood, which change the nature of the political and economic pressure being exerted. I believe that is really important.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise what the Netherlands has done in Gaza. That is important, but we need real trade in Gaza, we need to have the crossings open to allow the import and export of goods to build an economy in which people can invest. That, I think, is something we have discussed many times.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say a very few words about Egypt, and to start with Asmaa Mahfouz. Our delegation is in contact all the time with her and with her lawyers, but there is no doubt that these next days in Egypt are going to be crucial for the transition. Today, we have the revised Constituent Assembly. It looks as if it will be more representative than its predecessor, but the challenges of agreeing a constitution by December are formidable, and the constitution is so important. There will be two important judgments on Thursday about the running of Ahmed Shafik in the second round and whether the parliamentary elections from last November will stand. Then, of course, there will be the run-off on Saturday and Sunday. So there is enormous uncertainty in the country, but I hope that what we will end up with is someone whom we can see has a democratic mandate. We work with all those who share our values and principles wherever they come from, whatever faith they have, as long as they believe in human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the principles and values that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that we could have talked about other countries – Morocco is a good example of a country going through change, and which we have not forgotten – but I do hope that honourable Members will stay committed to trying to support the people of Syria in the way that we have witnessed in this House this evening. It is so important that we do everything we possibly can to stop a situation that is much worse than we can even imagine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When this is absent, then the only prior is the hope that time will solve the problem. And, in the meantime, thousands die. If there was ever a misnomer, it is the title of this organisation.

Firstly, our duty to respond to the atrocities suffered by Syrians at the hands of the al-Assad regime conflicts with the need for an international political strategy for joint external action and with the general willingness to exhaust all possibilities for a peaceful resolution. Secondly, faced with human tragedy, thousands of people have fled the country, which represents significant pressure on neighbouring countries and demands urgent humanitarian assistance. Thirdly, Syria’s role on the regional stage is crucial for the security situation in the Middle East, in particular, for Israel, which is seeing a growing extremist and anti-Israeli threat at its borders. Lastly, the rise of religious extremism and the strengthening of fundamentalist terrorist groups represent a global threat which we cannot ignore. Baroness Ashton, the EU must be proactive and do its utmost to support the efforts of Mr Annan, but it must also know where to draw the ‘red line’ and encourage all international partners to take the necessary steps, including considering military intervention, if Mr al-Assad continues along this barbaric road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Kofi Annan mission looked poised to bring relief to the embattled people of Syria and both Russia and China seemed inclined to contemplate the cost of sustaining the Assad regime to the end. Two months later, all that is gone. The bloodshed continues at even higher levels, the regime is holding fiercely onto power, Kofi Annan’s plan has become questionable and Russia, in particular, has toughened its stance to the point of preventing any potential external intervention to relieve the Syrians of this nightmare. After all, the international community was able to unite and act – see Bosnia and Kosovo – in situations that were not apparently as bad as that existing in Syria today. Still, with all those shortcomings, the Annan Plan seems to be all that we have got, because, in Lady Ashton’s words, ‘No other option has been able to gather any kind of international support’. Sad, but true, this is how international politics works. The question is, how will we look into the eyes of the ordinary Syrians when all this is over? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The government in Damascus is still using violence against its own people, who should be the top priority in any system and in any country. The present situation has even been compared to a civil war, in which the parties are, on the one hand, the country and, on the other, a regime that is using ever newer methods in its fight against the opposition, struggling to maintain its grip on power at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, despite the efforts of the international community, this conflict has not yet been resolved, which could significantly weaken the impact of this type of peaceful intervention. Yet NATO is not planning any military solutions; instead, it emphasises that priority must be given to political approaches. What is needed is to reach agreement within the United Nations and to develop a joint plan of action that could stop blood from being spilt and bring Syria out of the paralysing chaos in which it finds itself. The Syrian nation wants to follow a democratic path, as proven by its determination and sacrifices. The assistance provided by the international community should, however, be more decisive and more forceful calls should be made for concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
