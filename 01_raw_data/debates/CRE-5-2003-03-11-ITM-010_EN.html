<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner to this sitting. I would like to start by thanking all the parliamentary groups which have cooperated closely so that we can offer Parliament a clear text today, which focuses on action and not on words, on speeding up and not slowing down the strategy agreed in Lisbon, in Gothenburg and in Stockholm, to restore confidence to the European markets and thereby speed up our growth with a very clear objective, highlighted in the first paragraph: increasing job creation, which is a necessary condition if we are to compensate for ageing and maintain our social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out three strict limits to demand policies, which are included in the policy in the short term: to maintain macroeconomic stability, to maintain European competitiveness in an increasingly globalised world and to reduce public debt, in order to free up resources which must be destined towards investment and to create resources for future social needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of these key ideas is to increase coordination; we therefore welcome the strategies aimed at jointly examining the economic guidelines and the employment guidelines, but we would also like to integrate budgetary policies and supply policies, which remain in national hands, in order to create a framework which could provide a basis for the discussion of budgets, both European Union and national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of monetary policy, which is the next section, the report stresses that the European Central Bank must closely follow the evolution of prices, in view of the underlying inflation in the services sector. But it says something further. It says that everybody else, particularly the national governments, must do their duties: they must maintain the evolution of salaries linked to productivity, introduce measures in terms of the transparency of prices and reform their structures in order to increase productivity, in order to give the European Central Bank a margin, an additional margin, in the event that it is considered necessary to reduce interest rates, particularly if we want to bring interest rates into line with European export needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of budgetary policy, the message seems to me to be equally clear. This Parliament is stressing its commitment, which it has always maintained, to the Stability and Growth Pact. Secondly, it welcomes the Commission’s efforts to interpret this pact, to assess the budgetary situation of each Member State, taking account of volume of debt and quality of expenditure, particularly when it is investment expenditure, which is coherent with the Lisbon, Stockholm and Gothenburg strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it regrets the lack of application, the lack of diligence of those prodigal governments which, while running the risk of excessive deficit, do not appear to want to make any effort to reduce structural deficits. And finally, as an express appeal to the Commission, it urges it to play a more vigilant role at times of boom in order to ride out the storm at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structural reform policy, we stress that the lack of investment is key, and is the most definitive explanation of our lagging behind the United States, particularly investment in new technologies. We therefore call for the establishment in the economic guidelines of quantified objectives in the field of public and private investment and for the promotion of investment by the private sector in these technologies, essentially by means of the tax deductions, linked to obtaining profits rather than subsidies, since we have no very clear idea of which activities those subsidies are used for. We call for a new industrial policy, because people cannot live on services alone, as well as an effort in the field of renewable energies, on which I do not need to insist given the international climate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of small and medium-sized businesses, the Commission is urged to continue with the objectives of the Feira Charter, to facilitate their creation within 24 hours by means of new technologies, to advocate a postponement of taxes during the early years of operation, to simplify their operation, particularly in an administrative sense, and to exercise strict vigilance in the field of funding in the Basilea II negotiations, to stress the role of the European Investment Fund and to establish a network of guarantees which allows them access to the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of the liberalisation of the markets, transposition and therefore stressing the penalty mechanisms for States which do not comply, increasing competition in the privatised sectors, liberalising energy networks and particularly their connection.</p>
<p class="contents">On financial markets we are essentially in agreement. We welcome the efforts in the field of taxation and we would ask for further effort in order to achieve VAT at source and a consolidated basis in taxes on companies and we ask for stricter representation of the euro in international fora and a denomination of energies in this currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Commissioner, I hope that the message is clear and that it is well received. Thanks once again to all the groups and the President for their patience.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold"> Trentin (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Council representatives, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr García-Margallo’s excellent report has highlighted the need to pin, from now on, the broad economic policy guidelines and the objectives relating to the coordination of Member States’ economic and social policies to the goals set by the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, particularly where investment in research, lifelong learning and European infrastructure are concerned and as regards ensuring the efficiency of public services while safeguarding the general interest which they must serve, and, in addition, as regards an active ageing strategy which will help to bring about a substantial increase in the active population and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision, which requires that binding stages in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy be provided for as an integral part of the broad economic policy guidelines, cannot fail to affect – and this is the subject of my report – the Stability and Growth Pact, which is still devoid of binding indicators relating precisely to growth and the quality of growth or to the coordination of budgetary policies, as Mr dos Santos rightly points out.</p>
<p class="contents">My explicit question on this point, Commissioner, concerns the compatibility of the Lisbon objectives with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. Do the Lisbon objectives also concern the EMU States and to what extent, and, if they do, how can we make them as binding as the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact? If the answer to this question is yes, as I believe it is, the problem then arises of how to coordinate and reconcile the different areas of Union intervention as regards economic policy, social and employment policy, sustainable development, financial stability and growth and achieve synergic interaction between them. Clearly, this is not a question of procedure but a choice which must impact on the objectives of the Stability Pact and the way it is applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in this new context, the application of the Stability Pact cannot just be concentrated in those periods in which there are clear risks of a shift away from the objectives and constraints of the Pact as regards budget deficit or public debt, constraints that we have no intention of questioning, especially during this difficult, uncertain period. Indeed, the Stability and Growth Pact ought to curb the behaviour of the EMU States in periods of growth too, in order to prevent decisions leading away from the Lisbon objectives paving the way, in precisely those periods, for further departure from the objectives of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must acknowledge the difference between an economic policy which favours regular expenditures over public and private investment in periods of growth and a policy seeking to meet the Lisbon objectives in clear stages between now and 2010 in the areas of research and development, training and integrated European infrastructures. It must also realise the difference, at times of crisis or in the event of war, between an economic policy which seeks to reduce fiscal pressure across the board and a policy of boosting public and private investment, which the Commission itself should be able to see is in the common interest, not least in that it is bound up with European projects in the spirit of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, it is necessary to ascertain whether investment intended to contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives makes things worse rather than better in the event of the danger of a shift away from the 3% constraint and whether it cannot be made compatible with greater financial rigour in order to comply with the criteria of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that similar considerations and opportunities will all be taken into account together at the forthcoming Spring Council, and I would quietly point out, by way of conclusion, that there has to be institutional coordination of economic and social policies in the euro zone, coordination capable of taking majority decisions and showing, not least in the work of the Convention, that the enlargement of the Union which we are determined to make every effort to achieve will not hinder the progress or dampen the vitality of the European Union in the search for new, more advanced forms of integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmidt, Olle (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, those politicians who launched EMU were bold and far-sighted. There were many who believed that the project would fail. Some even hoped that it would. Their fears have nonetheless proved groundless. EMU has been very successful. Now, further reforms are needed, however, as well as compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the introduction of the euro has been a painless process, especially in terms of the huge logistical work involved. Certainly, there have been complaints about price rises, but the general price level has not increased. Further investigations may, however, be needed, something that we are now also requesting in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Three of the EU Member States are still outside the third phase of EMU: Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden, there being no special exemption rules in the case of Sweden. Today’s report concerns Sweden and the Commission’s biannual convergence report.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as I hope you already know, Sweden ought already to have been a fully fledged member of EMU. When my work on the report began – and I want to take the opportunity of expressing my thanks for all the support I have received – there was still a lot of uncertainty about the Swedish Government’s views. Now, the situation is different, I am happy to say. In a referendum on 14 September 2003, the Swedish people are to say yes or no to the euro. Fortunately enough, events have taken on their own momentum, independently of both the report and myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the ECB have recognised that Sweden has fulfilled three of the five convergence criteria: those relating to price stability, public sector finances and long-term interest rates. In two areas, Sweden is considered, however, not yet to have fulfilled the criteria. The most controversial of the convergence criteria is that relating to the rate of exchange because, unlike the other criteria, it has been so unclearly formulated. ERM membership must be viewed as a requirement, but the period of membership <span class="italic">may</span> be relatively short. The exchange rate criterion has, of course, also been applied flexibly to countries that have already introduced the euro. I am thinking in particular of Finland and Italy which were not, of course, a part of ERM2 for two years. The issue of membership of ERM2 is also significant and, of course, also very sensitive where the candidate countries are concerned. Because quite a few of them are well on the way towards adjusting to EMU, I would certainly advocate a degree of flexibility. I also noted that, in the course of a speech in Hungary the other week, the Commissioner was thinking along similar lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area in which the Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden does not meet the requirements of the Treaty is legal convergence. This has to do with the independence of the Swedish Central Bank. The issue has also been taken up in an exchange of letters between the President of the ECB and the Swedish Finance Minister. The ECB expressed particular concern about the lack of clear rules concerning transfers of reserves from the Swedish Central Bank to the national treasury. In his reply, however, the Finance Minister stressed that the necessary amendments would be submitted when the introduction of the euro was imminent, together with necessary changes to the constitution, even if time may be short, given Sweden’s requirement for an interim election in the case of constitutional changes. In my opinion, this does not mean however that Sweden is disqualified from the third stage of EMU right through to 2006 or 2007. One of the most important principles of the Union’s legal system is, of course, that EU law takes precedence over national law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make bold enough to say that Sweden needs the euro. At the same time, I would also venture to say that the euro in fact needs Sweden. The Swedish economy is in good shape and can meet the necessary requirements. That is something I am able to say, even though I am a member of the opposition in my country. As I see it, it is a necessary and obvious step for Sweden to become fully a part of European integration in its entirety and to have the euro as its currency and coinage. Now, it is the Swedish population that will decide this on 14 September. The ‘wait and see’ approach championed by some of my fellow MEPs in Parliament richly deserves to be criticised. What would have become of European integration if Robert Schuman’s natural inclination had been to hesitate, or if, when the Berlin Wall was torn down, Helmut Kohl had been governed by short-term economic interests, or if Jacques Delors’ distinguishing characteristic had been anxiety? Nothing at all would have become of it. It is my hope and my conviction that, on 15 September, I shall be able, with my head held high, to come back to you, Mr President, and to you, Commissioner, with the message: ‘It was a ”yes”’ vote. The Swedish people want to be fully involved and to exert influence over both the new and the old Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say that there is a certain confusion where the amendments are concerned. I nonetheless want to say, however, that I hope to be able to achieve as large and as broad a majority as possible. I have listened to the criticism and am able to accept that Amendments Nos 12 and 14 should be removed because their subjects are covered elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and most particularly, Commissioner Solbes Mira, the presentation of the Commission document on Public Finances to which my report is dedicated shared at the time the firmly–held conviction that the economic forecasts for the European area should then be systematically revised downwards. The economic context of budgetary surveillance has indeed proven to be much less favourable than initially predicted and is demonstrated, specifically, by the doubling of the Eurozone’s deficit between the years 2000 and 2001, by the ‘fact’ that this imbalance grew and became more serious in 2002 and by the explanation and real scrutiny of the serious budgetary difficulties that have occurred in four of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason, the Commission drew up recommendations and stated its intention to send early warnings about deviating from the budget to Member States that could potentially fail to comply. Although this was not carried out, it ultimately anticipated the true situation seen at the end of the year in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The tone of the speech President Romano Prodi gave this Parliament is therefore fully justified. In this speech he expressed his concern at the downturn in the economic cycle, but also emphatically criticised an inflexible and dogmatic enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact regardless of changing circumstances and consequently called for adjustments and the introduction of more sophisticated criteria for implementing the Pact. Since then, many politicians, experts, research bodies, academics and leaders of public and published opinion have contributed their thoughts on the matter. The Commission itself has stuck to the prudent but ambitious interpretation of its President, redrafting a less rigid and more active framework of budgetary supervision that now adheres to the principle that the Pact’s implementation must make it an ever more valuable instrument in promoting stability, growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report endorses this viewpoint to the extent that it considers this to correspond to an intermediate stage between the rigid application of the Pact and the crucial development towards an interpretative model, which it considers to be inevitable in future, taking account of more sophisticated criteria such as inflation, employment, public debts and changes in these debts, financial burdens arising from the ageing of the population and investment requirements. Finally, the quality of public expenditure must serve to bring the SGP into line with the objectives laid down in the Lisbon strategy and with the principle of sustainable development as agreed in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The political prevalence of budgetary constraints and a rigid interpretation of the financial balance under multilateral surveillance have led in recent years to a steady decline in the ratio of public investment to GDP, although it must be acknowledged that private investment has followed the same trend. All of this coincides with the increased difficulties that the European economy has been displaying. The solutions proposed initially or which are now being adopted are not unheard of in the context of some developed economies in the OECD where the ‘golden rule’ is a crucial element, not only for consolidating public finances, but also for launching and sustaining a process of economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the enormous step that was the creation of the single currency, the Union appears today to be in a genuine state of paralysis. The excessive restrictions on monetary and budgetary policies, which were designed with the intention of strengthening the European economy and its single currency and to allay the suspicions and fears of the Union’s most powerful countries, could turn into unexpected limitations that will make the sought-after recovery entirely dependent on the smooth operation of the driving force that is the US economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The flexibility and rationality that are being advocated are not incompatible with the need to ensure compliance with the real spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact, and nor does a public debate on the matter diminish the scope of its objectives. The financial consolidation of the States that accept a common monetary policy and a single currency and which reject any self-sufficiency that hinders open relations with countries outside their own zone is crucial and must be pursued. Many countries, incidentally, have enshrined principles and rules in their Constitutions establishing rules – some more rigid, some less so – for budgetary deficits. This is also crucial in the political framework of the Union, but if this type of commitment is to be effective, priority consideration must be given to the interests of the zone as a whole – a very substantial area – with the use of discretionary instruments being acceptable in exceptional circumstances to aid the recovery of the least developed regions or countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We will otherwise face the risk of seeing only formal compliance with budgetary obligations, with countries in difficulty resorting to the most varied and creative accounting systems (which also makes their rapid harmonisation a necessity), in the sole aim of keeping the Commission satisfied, as guardian of the Treaties, or of temporarily deceiving the financial markets and for a while escaping their rightful punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">This, unfortunately, is the situation seen in many European economies at the end of 2002. Determining the current problems of the European economy when drawing up the balance-sheet of the degree to which the objectives outlined at the Lisbon Extraordinary summit have been attained is, therefore, absolutely crucial. It is also necessary to make it clear to Parliament, to the Council and the Commission that it is possible to achieve a balance between healthy financial consolidation in the countries of the Union and full compliance with these objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I will try within the time available to me to comment on the four reports presented to us. I will deal initially with the three relating to the general economic situation, the Stability and Growth Pact and public finances and finally I will comment on the report by Mr Olle Schmidt on the specific case of Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank Mr García-Margallo for the work he has done and, as he has said, for the clear message contained in this report with regard to the broad guidelines for economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the document for this year is of a more strategic nature than usual, insofar as it is a document which intends to define the broad European strategy for the next three years. It is true that it is being produced in a situation of particular economic uncertainty, it is true that we have given certain indications on how to act in the event of asymmetric shocks, where naturally monetary policy must be used, when there may be sectoral repercussions, a situation in which we will undoubtedly have to use specific instruments of a different nature or if we experience those unusual events which are laid down in the Community legislation and which allow us to act also in terms of budgetary policy, while accepting however, the limits of 3% laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr García-Margallo has insisted on the need for a healthy macroeconomic policy and clearly supports the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe we take the same approach and we have no great difficulty in accepting his recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">He also refers to a point which we all believe to be fundamental and that is how we can increase the growth potential in Europe. Unquestionably through an increase in employment and productivity. We know that increases in productivity – you have referred to this yourself – and growth in employment are also closely related to the evolution of salaries, and that it is essential that salaries are compatible with reasonable evolution of employment and with increases in productivity. But it is also essential – and this is the approach we adopted in Lisbon – to improve education and training. We believe it is also essential to implement more appropriate taxation in order to achieve these objectives and of course to carry out more public and private investment. I will discuss this in more detail when I come to the report by Mr Trentin.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we consider it essential, within the Lisbon framework, to define the appropriate framework for both public and private investment to be carried out and to make progress on certain fundamental elements. In recent weeks there has been an element which I would like to stress, which is the approval of the Community patent, which will undoubtedly be an innovative element and which will allow for greater European innovation and of course to define public expenditure according to criteria which will improve productivity or production.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad guidelines for economic policy, however, should not be seen independently from the Stability and Growth Pact. Mr Trentin refers to this point when he points out the need to approach the Stability and Growth Pact jointly in Lisbon. I believe we all agree that restructured public finances are essential not only in terms of allowing monetary policy to play its role, but also in order to provide the necessary margin so that the automatic stabilisers can function in a cyclical situation. However, Mr Trentin raises something else: what more can we do, in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact, in terms of growth? How can we ultimately improve the quality of public finances?</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Santos also stresses this point, which I would like to focus on further. I believe that the key lies in greater investment in research and development. We have set certain specific objectives on this point, since public investment in this sector functions satisfactorily but nevertheless there are more deficiencies with regard to the functioning of the private economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact, however, as modified in the Communication in November, introduces an additional element in relation to this policy so that it may further promote development in Europe. It is true that the pact provides us with the initial means for achieving budgetary balance or a situation of surplus in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In its analysis of the pact, however, the Commission has seen that in certain cases temporary deviations are justified provided that they are for reasons aimed at improving growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that physical investment and, above all, public investment is not the only element which can allow a temporary deviation in budgetary balance to be carried out within the framework of the pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that all actions which ultimately allow us to increase our growth potential must be treated in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore proposed in its Communication that there could be temporary deviations in countries which fulfil certain conditions; essentially those which have low levels of ratio in relation to public debt; which furthermore have already achieved a situation of budgetary balance and which, of course, establish this type of deviation in order to increase growth. And here we are talking about investments in infrastructures, investments in knowledge, but also measures of a fiscal nature, for example tax reductions, which may eventually allow us to improve growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the essential elements which the Commission raised in its Communication, which have not been taken up in an entirely exact form in the final conclusions of the Council, but which nevertheless have allowed, or are allowing, sufficient progress to be made in order to achieve a result which we believe must allow us to improve in terms of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Council says is that we must carry out analyses on a case-by-case basis, that there is no rule for this type of deviation; it does not impose any condition with regard to how the Commission must implement its proposals and naturally the Commission remains convinced that the proposals we have made so far, in a couple of specific cases, with regard to these temporary deviations, are still valid and they are the criteria we will use in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the coordination of our budgetary policies, I would say that the system has improved, but that, nevertheless, we cannot be completely satisfied, since we have too many deviations. I believe it is essential to make progress on coordination and in this regard the broad guidelines for economic policy are intended to make improvements, not only by means of the tri-annual approach, but also by paying more attention to application reports than to general approaches. And I believe we must improve our multinational coordination systems, since – as we have highlighted in our proposals to the Convention – there are certain deficiencies in the current system which prevent ‘peer pressure’ from functioning in the manner which was drawn up in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say to Mr dos Santos that I am grateful for his support on the analysis of the public finances for 2002 and the quality of public finances. That report is a key to understanding what is done subsequently, in November, when we present our proposal for a communication to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Commission Communication to the Council we do not intend to modify the pact or to make it more flexible. Our intention, on the basis of our experience over recent years, is to ensure that the application of the pact is better suited to the specific situations of each of the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe it essential in our Communication that the Member States confirm their commitment to the pact. That is why we requested a European Council resolution to allow this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Though I have said this several times, it is perhaps worth repeating that we insist in our communication on certain fundamental points. 3% is still the nominal deficit limit; however, we have to take account of the evolution of the cycle and therefore the evolution of cyclically adjusted deficits is an essential element.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to achieve budgetary balance in the medium term, those countries which have not yet achieved it will have to make budgetary efforts to the tune of half a point per year, as a minimum, or more in the event that there is a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are aware that there has been a relaxation of the budgetary policy at good times in the economic cycle, which has created subsequent problems and it is therefore essential to pay more attention to ensuring that there is no further procyclic behaviour in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is essential to pay attention to debt and as Mr Trentin pointed out previously, I believe it is essential to consider the specific situation of certain Member States, in such a way as they have greater room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this has been approved by the Ecofin Council, with the corrections which I referred to in relation to the report by Mr Trentin.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to my final comment on the report by Mr Schmidt. It is true that in our convergence report on Sweden we referred to compliance with the convergence criteria with two exceptions: the legal convergence criterion, particularly in relation to the Swedish Central Bank, and non-compliance with the exchange rate convergence criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to note that, when we talk about the figures relating to development in Sweden, the remaining convergence criteria are being complied with even more comfortably than in the past. However we have yet to deal with those two elements which I hope can be resolved in the future. You know what our position is in relation to them. In the legal field, the Central Bank’s independence system must be adapted. With regard to the exchange rate criterion, we have to apply the Treaty; but, as I have said many times, we will have to take account of past experiences without a doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally believe that the adoption of the euro would be beneficial to Sweden and I hope that that country will soon fulfil the necessary conditions. I also believe it would be beneficial for the European Union and for the eurozone in particular, since it would represent a significant advance in our process of integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank the Commissioner and applaud his clear statement in the debate on these four reports. He said that the Commission did not wish either to make the Stability and Growth Pact more flexible or to adapt it, but that it simply wished to impose stricter standards when assessing the situation in the Member States. I consider this to be a better policy than the proposals made by Members from the other groups, in particular those put forward by Mr Trentin and Mr dos Santos.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Trentin said here bears no relation to the report tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, nor are his comments appropriate in a debate on the subject of the annual assessment of the stability and convergence programmes. In school I would say to Mr Trentin that he had strayed from the subject. In his draft report there was not a single word about it, and it was only the amendments tabled by the various different groups that brought the report closer to the issue at hand. Today you clean forgot about it once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful to the Commissioner for reminding us once more of the Lisbon objectives, which are not at odds with the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary consolidation, but in fact encapsulate all of the framework conditions: a flexible labour market and the need to increase investment, reduce taxes, and invest in research and training. This cannot however absolve the Member States from applying strict standards in their budgetary policy, as prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Trentin report we have at least demanded that in future the Commission be able to send out the blue letters on its own, without this being dependent on a vote in the Ecofin Council in which the offenders are indirectly involved. We want to strengthen the Commission's independence. The proposals that have been made in the reports are inconsistent in many respects. This is shown by the fact that for two years now there has been a consistent policy of calling the Stability and Growth Pact into question and of undermining it in every possible respect and with every possible proposal, with the sole aim of ensuring that the consolidation of state budgets in several Member States is no longer recognised as a necessary precondition for stable finances and a stable economic and monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course not the case that there is insufficient room for manoeuvre. Eight out of twelve Member States in the euro zone have already managed to balance their budgets. The offenders who are not sticking to the rules are the ones who are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be changed. Those that have stable budgets and that are even making a surplus are penalised because in the euro zone everyone is in the same boat, my own country, Germany, as much as any other. If Germany with its considerable economic power does not comply with the Stability Pact then it puts the stability of the euro at risk. We cannot deflect attention away from the Member States' responsibilities by correcting and retouching the rules. The golden rule that appears in some of Mr dos Santos' amendments is of no use here either.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no such thing as good or bad debt. There is just debt: debt in investment and infrastructure and consumer debt. Mr Trentin, I am sure that you are familiar with the <span class="italic">scala mobile</span>, the debt that brought the Italian State to its knees over the last twenty years, when new debts were repeatedly accumulated, with the unions playing along with it, but no way out was found. The European model has brought lower inflation and stable monetary policy conditions. That is what we should keep as our basis, what we must be rigorous about keeping as our basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to our Swedish Members that we welcome the fact that Sweden wishes to join the Economic and Monetary Union. We will do all we can to help it to do so, but we ask that it be under the conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. If the government does not yet meet them – independence of the central bank or even the issue of two-year membership of the European Monetary System – then it needs to address that; it must not be allowed to let it slip. In this respect we have every reason to thank the Commission for the line that it is taking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot go on trotting out the same old formulae. Unfortunately they fall far short of what is required at a difficult time, which is not only characterised by an economic downturn but also, regrettably, by the shadows that an approaching war is casting over economic and employment policy. That is why Parliament's reports – and I mean all of those on the table this evening – show a glimmer of hope but at the same time make demands that mercilessly expose the weaknesses in the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline that it is out of the question to eliminate a Stability and Growth Pact that has been created to bring order to the economy. Instead we need to apply it taking into account the Lisbon objectives in a time and a place and in such a way that it makes sense, because the people of Europe deserve no less.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to make every effort to halt the economic slide. We cannot deny either that even the European Central Bank is now talking about risks of a downward trend in the European Union. This means that we need to pursue a proactive policy and to that extent the repeated references to structural reforms do not serve any purpose either.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, we do not yet know what economic benefits these structural reforms will bring to the European Union and we have no idea what impact they will have on employment policy. Economic institutes, national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question. But we need this answer to know which direction is the right one. I believe that the saying still holds true: employment creates growth, but growth also creates employment. We have to work on the basis of real growth and not only on the basis of potential for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out once more that it is absolutely right – as the reports also state – for us to refer repeatedly to the lack of investment in both the private and public sectors. We are not honouring the Lisbon agreement about 3% growth. Neither are we respecting the agreement to invest more in research and development, and that too applies to both the private and public sectors. Japan and the USA are streets ahead of us in both respects. At the moment we perhaps do not really need an economic government, but coordination up and across our governments, coordination that is worthy of the name, is in the interests of growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The immediate aim of this debate is essentially to prepare for the Spring Council and it is intended to respond to the corresponding assessment of the so-called ‘Lisbon process’, complemented by the decisions of the Gothenburg and Barcelona Councils. Within this context, I would firstly like to express my concern and that of my group at the fact that the aim established for 2010 of being a more competitive economy with higher quality and greater levels of employment has not been achieved. When assessing these three years, despite the difficulties of the American economy, we find that, in terms of growth, productivity levels and employment levels, we are further behind than three years ago. It is therefore clear that there is a very worrying difference between what is preached in the Councils and what is practiced in the Member States, and this prejudices the Union’s overall result.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Liberal Group believe that the main problems principally stem from the lack of compliance with the liberalisation processes agreed, since, as the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil points out, there are still significant structural reforms to be carried out and certain basic markets, such as the labour market, must be made even more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current situation, which is not exactly one of the best economic situations the European Union has been in in recent years, there are three key aspects which particular attention must also be paid to. Firstly, we must improve the level not just of research and development but of its application within the productive system. Let us hope that this historic agreement on the European patent, as Commissioner Solbes has mentioned, will provide promotion in this area, but that it will also pay special attention to the creation and development of small and medium-sized businesses based on the application of new technologies, because, as was demonstrated in the 1990s, they are significant sources of work.</p>

He stated that the European Union does not have an economic policy. He has contributed to a good debate and I thank him for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering causes and solutions, the notion of inflexibility and structural reform are often bandied about. We are forever asking the Commission, the ECB and the experts what they mean. I have been struck by the imprecise and inconsistent nature of the responses. At a remarkable conference, Mr Adair Turner, the Director-General of the CBI, said that we must be careful about dismantling the Welfare State and that the agenda for liberalisation in Europe, although useful, represents only a partial response to present challenges. Clearly, the problem of pensions will not be resolved unless there is a large increase in employment rates in Europe. It is essential to mobilise all human potential. A great deal of work will have to go into reforming the labour markets, especially as regards training and qualifications. We must, however, remember that this involves reorganisation and there will be a price to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider why there is a lack of productive public and private investment. One of the reasons relates to the flow of capital, much of which ends up in the United States. Though the financial market might have stimulated global investment over the last decade, I think it is a fallacy to believe that the market itself will initiate a new round of investments in Europe. It does not provide for local development or for the development of SMEs and infrastructure. The European Union should be able to finance effective networks of services of general interest and develop policies on productive enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not only have a supply problem; we also underestimate the problem of demand. Hundreds of billions in paying off goodwill are putting a serious strain on business and are hampering recovery. Far from fearing inflation, the European Central Bank should amend its target and reduce its real rates below zero. Furthermore, even if some Member States have not known how to reform their public finances or been unable to do so in time, the seriousness of the present climate justifies taking measures to support activity, including waiving the 3% rule as a temporary measure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two more points I would like to make. I believe war against Iraq is not just madness, but economic folly too. It will increase public deficits pointlessly in both the United States and Europe, when we want to reduce them. As one of our experts said, the United States is skating on very thin ice. The future growth of that country will require us to make even greater demands on our capital reserves. This is yet another contradiction. Europe cannot therefore just tag along with the United States. Europe must devise a policy of her own. We in Europe have our backs against the wall. The Convention, however, is silent. As for the calls for economic government, they bring to mind a scene from the film<span class="italic"> Shoulder Arms</span>. In it a military unit is engulfed in fog, everyone is stumbling around and a soldier is heard calling for his captain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This being the case, we will not support the report drafted by Mr Trentin, whom I greatly admire. We will consider instead Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem. When a rapporteur from the left and a rapporteur from the right decide to address the same issue, the report from the left is pulled to pieces by honourable Members on the right. With a bit of luck, the report is approved when it is put forward by a rapporteur from the right. We must therefore recognise that the García-Margallo y Marfil report is much better and much more useful than Mr Trentin’s, now that it has been cut to ribbons by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Be that as it may, I have long acknowledged that Mr García-Margallo y Marfil has demonstrated considerable qualities in his role as a rapporteur. As Mr Langen said, the Trentin report is clearly not actually a report drawn up by Mr Trentin. Mr Trentin’s speech almost entirely contradicted the contents of his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore only comment on the contents of the García Margallo y Marfil report, in its present form. It is my belief that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support all the objectives and comments on the subject as included in the García-Margallo y Marfil report. It has the virtue of bringing the objectives of economic policy back into line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. We want to ensure that Europe is a model of economic growth. Growth should be based on high-quality investment in human resources, high-calibre public investment and on the use of environmentally-sustainable technologies. Given the size of the continent of Europe, which has one of the highest population concentrations in the world, it is my belief that this is the only way forward for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The García-Margallo y Marfil report does contain discrepancies. It is forced to juggle the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact must be welcomed, while also acknowledging the need to finance investments. It acknowledges that the article in the Treaty of Maastricht which prevents European institutions from criticising the European Central Bank must not be undermined, while also stating that it is nonetheless necessary to provide credit at special rates for the required investments. It mentions taxation, not interest rates. In short, the report tends to skirt round the real problems of institutional impasse we are currently experiencing within the European Union. Next year these problems will catapult us back into the situation of so-called europaralysis we experienced during the dark years of working towards the euro from 1990 to 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">As we cannot control the interest rates fixed by the European Central Bank, interest rates will be too high. This will present problems for Member States wishing both to invest and pay off their debts. These excessive interest rates will also make the euro too strong. It will hamper exports at a time of global recession. Unless we resolve to tackle the Stability and Growth Pact as it currently stands, we will be unable to finance the investments Mr García-Margallo y Marfil calls for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Stability and Growth Pact is an agreement, an agreement that we must hold one another to. The words that Mr Trentin writes about the Stability Pact in his report are worth reading. He says that even in periods of economic recession the pact must be adhered to closely and I am in complete agreement with this. Nor must we now go back on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil rightly says that the European leaders at the forthcoming spring summit must dispense with vague and self-satisfied declarations and must speak plainly. Clear agreements about the way in which we wish to achieve the economic objectives remain necessary to comply with the pact even in this period of recession.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore greatly amazed when it appears once again that France is unwilling to comply with the agreements made. Last Thursday it again became clear that this Member State would make no attempt to put its 2003 budget straight. Where Germany, Portugal and Italy are trying to put their budgets right within the agreements made, France, on the contrary, does not even express its intention finally to give account for the agreements made.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that if this Parliament wishes to make a serious contribution to policy-making in the economic field, then it is high time that we summoned the Member States and politicians that are unwilling to comply with these agreements to this place to give account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The radical Members will support them in their present form.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into the details of the individual resports, but I would like to take this opportunity to make some more general comments. Firstly, I believe that we should be a little mistrustful of high-sounding slogans and goals such as the Lisbon objectives, to which we are constantly referring. I do not feel that the fact that Europe decided at a certain juncture to set itself, and I quote once again: ‘a new strategic goal for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth’ and all the other goals we are familiar with is either a great leap forward or the basis for a new economic policy for the Member States, unless we think that, in the past, the States did not want to make their countries competitive countries and did not want to aim at full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to constantly stressing these objectives and performing analyses – the European Parliament is a political body, not a research centre – I feel we should discuss the reason why these high-sounding goals are not being met and which are the political costs which we in Europe do not have the courage to face in order to achieve them, to convert them into practical reforms, the reforms discussed in the reports before us today. I feel that the European economic structures need to be completely overhauled.</p>
<p class="contents">We are continually referring with pride to the European social model and the social market economy, but then we state explicitly in the reports – I think this is the case with Mr García-Margallo’s report – that the fate of the European social model is dependent on US economic recovery: if there is no economic recovery in the United States there will be no economic growth in Europe, and the social model we are so proud of will experience much more difficult times than those we are already experiencing today.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis in Germany is an indication of the crisis of an old economic model, the model of an old Europe which has nothing left to invest. We state repeatedly in the reports that we need more public investment – although we do not say where we are to find the money – and more private investment. I do not believe that private investment in Europe is low because of interest rates or, therefore, that our only objective should be to pressurize the European Central Bank to give us a more flexible interest rate policy, thereby facilitating private investment. Private investment will not increase because of lower interest rates: it will increase if and when we have a more flexible economy, with flexibility introduced in large doses.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforms to make the economy more flexible carry a political cost, and we are failing to discuss that cost: there is a price to be paid for meddling with the structure of the labour market and going against the powerful lobbies constituted by the monopolies – half of the European Union’s budget is tied up in agricultural subsidies and protection – and there is a political cost for considering using these resources to spark off a new wave of investment in high technology and scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a comment on the subject of pensions: the need for rigorous national budgets arises, first and foremost, from the need for national budgets to have the capacity to deal with the problems related to the aging of the population and the costs derived from the structural reform of the pensions systems. We owe this to the future generations of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 1 January 2002, the euro was introduced as the currency, in notes and coinage, of 12 European Union countries. The transition was very successful, and people accepted the new currency in a positive way. Worries about price increases proved to be more or less unjustified. As everyone knows, Sweden is not among those countries that went over to using the euro as a currency. The reason for this was, of course, mainly political. If Sweden is to be able to introduce the euro as a currency, we must however formally meet five convergence criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden fulfils the three criteria relating to price stability, public sector finances and long-term interest rates. That is all well and good, but Sweden does not fulfil the remaining two criteria, that is to say those relating to the rate of exchange and legal convergence. With regard to the rate of exchange criterion, the Swedish krona has obviously fluctuated in value in recent years. It should however be borne in mind that, when Sweden formally requests a reappraisal, this will be carried out in the course of a second reference period and against a background of expectations that may tend to increase exchange rate stability.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to legal convergence, it is essential for Sweden as soon as possible to introduce the change in Swedish legislation that is required if the euro is to be introduced. The outcome of the forthcoming referendum must of course be respected but, in my opinion, Sweden should, in the event of a ‘yes’ vote, already be prepared to prevent a delay in the introduction of the euro due to the absence of legal convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect for the convergence criteria, the decision concerning Swedish participation in the third phase of EMU is political. It is a decision that will be made by the Swedish people. In the referendum of 14 September 2003, the Swedish people will decide for a long time to come which currency is to be used in Sweden. On the other hand, Sweden is obliged, under the Treaty of Maastricht, to become fully involved in EMU cooperation once the convergence criteria have been fulfilled. Unlike Denmark and Great Britain, Sweden has no special exemption clause, but we shall hopefully obtain a ‘yes’ vote from the Swedish people on 14 September. As a result, the Swedish Government need no longer, either intentionally or unintentionally, delay or avoid taking the measures whereby Sweden will fulfil the remaining convergence criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted with satisfaction that Mr Olle Schmidt accepted Amendments Nos 3 and 4 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This will make it possible to obtain that broad support for the report desired by both the rapporteur and myself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turning to the situation of public finances in France, one cannot help remarking that economic policy is not considered as an issue of common interest. The Treaty is not being respected. One cannot help remarking too that economic and monetary union does not actually exist, certainly as far as economic union is concerned. The Stability and Growth Pact is at the heart of these mechanisms. Nevertheless, it appears to be more of a safeguard rather than a tool of economic policy. The adoption of the Lisbon strategy could subsequently have been the catalyst that would have provided the economic and monetary union with an economic policy. In short, the Stability and Growth Pact has not proved to be a dynamic tool for implementing this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the tools we have at our disposal are the famous broad economic policy guidelines we are discussing again this evening. These will galvanise approaches on European Union economic policy in the weeks and months to come. What could the outcome be, Commissioner? At present these broad economic policy guidelines are functioning as an academic exercise. They are not having any impact on the public finances of the Member States, which simply wait for penalties to be imposed through the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact once it is too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a strategy for growth. You said so yourself in your speech. This means we need more tools than we currently have available. Commissioner, the Council has just expressed its opinion on your statement. I think we need to go further and we must do so at the Convention. I think that we must work together to establish mutually acceptable proposals. We should draw up measures which will at long last endow the European Union with the means not only to develop a genuine economic policy, but also to conceive of it as serving the common good and to implement the objectives of the Lisbon strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore focus my comments on the Commission’s statement and on the contribution of the Commissioner, and will offer both my strong support. In my view, the Commission is fulfilling its role as guardian of the treaties on this matter perfectly. I believe the Stability and Growth Pact is not dead. I believe that above and beyond the arguably controversial statements made at the end of last year on formulas that could be perceived as risky, it is important to insist upon the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact and to ensure that its spirit is kept alive. The Maastricht criteria mean we are committed to a monetary union that is also a political union based on a number of values. The stability on which the euro is based goes beyond the technical definition of the concept. It amounts to a mutual agreement on a form of social contract. As well as being a strong currency, the euro must above all be a stable currency. In proclaiming this principle, Europe is setting aside its bad habits of the twentieth century, characterised by inflation, which represented a tax for poor people. Europe has decided to commit itself to being a confident society with a stake in the future. These are the values we are presenting to the countries about to join the European Union. Herein lies another reason not to alter these values by taking imprudent action which would undermine them. When players are not doing well at a game, they do not ask for the rules to be changed, but learn them instead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Item 6 of this report states that the introduction of the euro is part of the Treaty obligations for all the Member States, including Sweden in other words. Item 5 states, however, that referendums are to be held and that the outcomes of these must be respected, even if they entail rejecting the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">This comes across as being extremely self-contradictory. Mr Olle Schmidt hopes that the Swedish people will vote ‘yes’ and so resolve this contradiction. There is not much, however, to indicate that they will do so. On the contrary, the ‘no’ camp is at present very clearly in the lead, by ten per cent according to the latest poll. The trend suggests that this lead will become ever greater. It may also be worth Parliament’s knowing that, among those who say ‘no’, are quite a few ministers in the Swedish Government, including the minister for trade and industry, Leif Pagrotsky, at least two former presidents of the Swedish Central Bank and a long list of highly regarded economists, who all believe that Sweden should vote ‘no’. The situation does not therefore reflect the classic picture of an educated Europhile élite and an uninformed populace. What we have instead is a political debate demanding objectivity and arguments on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has a well-run economy. In the years during which Sweden has not been involved in cooperation concerning the euro, its economy has, in almost all respects, been strengthened in relation to those of the eurozone countries. Swedish industry traditionally asserts that the euro community is at all events good for trade. The business ’paper, <span class="italic">Affärsvärlden</span> has recently shown that this too is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The economists sympathetic to EMU cannot deny this state of affairs. They therefore say, as Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman just did, that the arguments in favour of EMU are not economic but political. It does not sound especially convincing when it is economists who say this, as if they were arguing in favour of entering this political union on grounds contrary to those of practical economic sense. It is not easy to sell this message to the Swedish people. The truth is that EMU has not been the success it was expected to be. The Stability and Growth Pact is coming up against evermore criticism, and economic stagnation is increasingly widespread. For Sweden, the German economy is particularly important, but it is a difficult task right now to convince the Swedish people to make their future dependent upon the German economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue concerns not only Sweden, but also the UK and Denmark. We shall soon also have a range of new Member States that are also outside the framework of cooperation concerning the euro. In those countries, too, there may perhaps be referendums on the euro and, as a result, the euro may be rejected there. In that situation, the definitive question must be asked: what should the EU and the European Central Bank do if Sweden and perhaps other Member States were to elect to stay outside the currency union? Is it possible to contemplate a euro community that is voluntary in character? What, in actual fact, do the Commission and the Council have to say about these matters?</p>

In its current form, this report fails to challenge the principles of the neo-liberal credo, which unfortunately are at the heart of many Community policies. Yesterday, the dock workers brought this home to us forcefully in this very city and with every justification. The report does not query the validity of the stability and growth programmes to any significant extent. It is worth considering the meaning of the terms ‘growth’ and ‘stability’. By definition, things that are ‘stable’ do not grow. Growth means movement; stability means the opposite. Certainly, the reality is dialectical in nature. On the other hand, this use of words could be construed as an attempt to resolve a contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">The report appears to reject any initiative to make the stability and growth criteria more flexible, and particularly the famous 3% criterion. Given the present economic difficulties, some Member States, and not just the smallest among them, are finding it increasingly difficult to comply with the 3% rule. Will this remedy kill the patient? We should note that experts from both the European Union and Member States gave overly optimistic predictions of growth. We hoped that the American economy would show signs of recovery, and that the European economy would follow suit. This has not happened, however. The policies pursued by Member States and the European Union were therefore based on inaccurate data. In this respect, the rigidity of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact seems to run counter to the fundamentals of good governance. People better qualified than I on this subject have spoken strongly on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We should envisage policies of Keynesian cyclic recovery. We should also consider policies aimed at achieving long-term improvement of the bases of the economy. These include, for example, energy efficiency and the provision of training. I would like to add that good governance implies reliable economic data, meaning the State must benefit from the Rule of Law. The fact that the Basque newspaper <span class="italic">Egunkaria</span> has been banned for six months makes one wonder whether the Basque country is still within a country where the Rule of Law prevails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This mainly concerns just three countries, namely France, Germany and Portugal. We should remember that, when considering the budget or any other subject, we must not fail to see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">The three countries with the highest deficits have one thing in common. They have all had socialist governments. I would add that Germany still has a socialist government. These governments have been lax on public spending and have failed to implement reforms which could have achieved savings. They have wasted the margins for manoeuvre achieved through the growth in the years 2000/2001. We are now dealing with the bitter consequences of this.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular tree must not obscure our vision. The real problem is the general decline in public balances in the eurozone. This stood at less than 2.4% of GDP in 2002, close to the 3% criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cause of this is the slowdown in the growth rate, and the tide is not yet turning, even slowly. This goes against the somewhat unrealistic assertions of the reports we are considering this evening. One of the possible causes of this slowdown is the economic climate. The main cause, however, is to be found in the huge public payments and the lack of structural flexibility. No solutions have yet been found for the latter. In this respect, we must break the taboo and ask whether in fact the euro itself forms part of the rigid structures holding back growth. In view of the marked differences in performance between the eurozone and the countries outside the euro, the question certainly needs to be asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are losing ground, should the Stability and Growth Pact be made more flexible? I am aware that the response from the Commission, the European Central Bank and even the last Ecofin Council was overwhelmingly negative, although a number of minor modifications were put forward. With respect to both the Stability and Growth Pact and foreign policy, the European Union, as usual, does not want to face reality. Instead it wants to paper over the ways in which we are slipping behind on meeting fundamental criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we should not lose sight of the objective of completely eliminating public deficits. This is certainly a laudable aim. We think, however, that the French Government is right to maintain their programme of reducing taxation in order to avoid aggravating the current crisis. We have to address a situation we have inherited and that is not of our making. We must at least try to do so in an intelligent way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start where Mr Gasòliba i Böhm left off. We are not setting new objectives. We are not making new promises or developing new hypotheses and analyses. What we are doing is finally taking ourselves seriously. If you do not take yourself seriously, then others will not take you seriously either. Some of us complain about the common principles of economic policy and at the same time criticise the fact that they are not respected. We regret the fact that growth, productivity and employment are falling, and that we are not making up ground but are lagging behind, and some of us think that the response to this diagnosis is more state intervention and more debt. Do the Members on the Left really believe this, even though at the same time we have to acknowledge that we do not even meet all of the objectives that we have set ourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about the rules, but at the same time we say – at least some of us do – that the rules should not be respected in such and such a case by such and such a country. At the same time, we regret the crisis of confidence in Europe about many economic policy measures and the principles and objectives of the European Union. You only create confidence with accountability and you only create accountability if you keep to and act on the things you resolve to do, both at European level and in the Member States. That is why I say very clearly on behalf of my group that we say ‘yes’ to the internal market. If we say ‘yes’ to the internal market however we must finally see to it that the barriers in the internal market are eliminated, that we really do create an action plan for financial services, that we really do implement the Risk Capital Action Plan, that we really do make the Charter for Small Enterprises a reality. We say ‘yes’ to competition policy. But that also means that we must, at last, eliminate tax provisions that distort competition. For some types of tax, such as value-added tax, energy tax, corporation tax and the taxation of pension funds, a convergence programme is necessary. We say ‘yes’ to the Lisbon strategy, but if we say ‘yes’ to the Lisbon strategy then we also have to say ‘yes’ to a model of the market economy that takes account of environmental and social concerns and does not constantly play the market off against social security. This also means that we finally need to ensure that with each piece of legislation we identify its economic impact and its impact on employment and the environment before we adopt it, rather than waiting until afterwards to be allowed to complain about the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We say ‘yes’ to a benchmark. We must learn from each other. And we say ‘yes’ to the Stability Pact because it provides an ordered framework, and that is why we also say ‘no’ to the golden rules, because they undermine the Stability Pact and we would thereby be stabbing the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, in the back and betraying the Stability and Growth objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of the fact that we are still not part of the eurozone, we are nonetheless actively attempting to fulfil the convergence criteria and to respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, point out that, on two issues – the rate of exchange and legislation concerning the Swedish Central Bank – Sweden does not meet the requirements. I believe that it will be possible quickly to fulfil the requirements regarding these issues if the outcome of the referendum is a ‘yes’ vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Our respect for these rules does not only have to do with the fact that they exist as external demands. Rather, it primarily has to do with the fact that we ourselves perceive that they are beneficial to the Swedish economy, which has also constantly been improving. At present, we have relatively low inflation and low unemployment, together with stable state finances. What is more, we have higher growth than many other countries. These are basically good rules. It would therefore be dangerous to begin to ignore these rules, together with budgetary discipline, as soon as some people have problems. That would undermine confidence in the euro and EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the approach pursued by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in certain amendments, there are reasons for developing the rules of the pact in the long term. Allow me to mention a few examples, for instance concerning the matter of price stability. Clearly, we must stick to the inflation target, but, for example, the two per cent requirement could possibly be the average for an economic cycle, so that inflation <span class="italic">could</span> be one per cent in one year and three per cent in another. That is something that would favour growth and increase flexibility. The same applies to state finances. The Commission has put forward an interesting proposal whereby countries with low national debts should be given increased opportunities to provide loans for long-term investments. That is something I believe would be constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me finally to say that, for both political and economic reasons, I hope that Sweden will soon be involved in cooperation concerning the euro. If we can strengthen and unify Europe in a situation in which the dollar’s and the United States’s dominance is so powerful and, at the same time, reduce the risk of new currency and interest crises, then I obviously think that the Swedes should vote in favour of the euro. I should like to express my thanks, especially to Mr Olle Schmidt who has produced a truly excellent report of which I shall vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the major economic downturn nor the reduction in private investment, nor the steady rise in unemployment and poverty shake their faith in the dogmas of the Stability Pact, whose budgetary and monetary rigidity has not only contributed to worsening the current economic crisis but has also limited the potential for growth in the European Union, with all the consequences this has for the increasingly high levels of inequality, poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is particularly serious, however, for the cohesion countries, such as Portugal, whose specific problems require a dynamic public sector and major public investment in order to attain a high level of real convergence, which is being hampered by the blind application of the Stability Pact’s irrational criteria. As we all know, globalisation should make monetary and budgetary policies more flexible towards the specific needs of each country and not lead to the rigid approach currently being applied, which ends up imposing flexibility on salaries and the labour market, giving pride of place to monetary policies and attaching far less importance to social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that the Committee on Economic Affairs did not consider the proposal I tabled, urging the Commission and the Council immediately to suspend the Stability Pact and calling for an in-depth revision of the EU’s economic and monetary policy guidelines, particularly in order to take account of issues such as the sustainable economic development of employment and the implementation of all social rights through universal and high-quality public services.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no economic sense to set the same budgetary deficit threshold for countries that have different levels of development, and nor is there any economic justification for sacrificing everything in the name of zero deficit. It is therefore clear that the fundamental objective of the pact is political, and this is why we are also unhappy about the proposals that have been put forward here, specifically by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate him on this work, even though I do not share his conclusions, for he has not only succeeded in responding to the Commission’s Convergence Report on Sweden, but has also taken the opportunity of making a contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden before the referendum in September. I would ask my fellow MEPs to be alert to what is stated in the report, for I find certain parts of it both erroneous and startling.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Olle Schmidt writes that prices have not risen in those countries that have introduced the euro. According to both Wim Duisenberg and a report in the Swedish daily, <span class="italic">Dagens Nyheter</span>, prices have in fact risen following the introduction of the euro and contributed to an increase in inflation in the eurozone of 0.2 per cent. Secondly, Mr Schmidt offers a false picture of the Swedish economy. He maintains that, in terms of trade, Sweden has been slipping behind because we have not introduced the euro. He does not, however, mention that Sweden has higher growth and lower unemployment than most countries that have the euro, and without in fact having either high inflation or a budget deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find startling, not to say of serious concern, in Mr Schmidt’s report is item 6, through which he wishes to make voters feel powerless by stating right now that, sooner or later, we must at all events become members of the eurozone. To that extent, the report is a biased contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present situation clearly highlights how important the Lisbon strategy for growth and competition is. The Union was to have become the world’s most competitive region by 2010 and an engine for growth, as our Member States’ leaders put it so beautifully at Lisbon. It all seems to have gone differently, however. In the last three years Europe has become a continent where the sun is setting, one which cannot keep its promises, which is betraying the confidence of its citizens, and which is leaving future generations to inherit only debts and uncovered pension liabilities. Can we really not do any better than this?</p>
<p class="contents">Only three countries – Denmark, Sweden and Finland – have done what was agreed at Lisbon. Ireland, Great Britain and the Netherlands have also made considerable progress. The three biggest economies in the euro area, however, have not done enough up till now. If we were at school, ladies and gentlemen, Germany, Italy and France would be kept down a year. I would not use such harsh words normally, but this is a serious business. What in your opinion, after all, does a press report tell you which says that at present a hundred Germans lose their jobs every hour?</p>
<p class="contents">International business cycles obviously play their part, but this does not alter the fact that our economic structures are so constrained that they are a huge barrier to growth. Moreover, when we then try to eliminate these structural problems, for example with the directive on port services, a whole crowd of brawlers and egotistic anarchists gather in front of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we do not need new targets or new complicated rules. Now is the time for action. This means genuine commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact and structural reforms. If Member States are to be allowed to deviate from the objective of balancing public finances under the Stability and Growth Pact, this will give out quite the wrong signal. In practice this would lead to rules that are open to interpretation, and would weaken our credibility and our ultimate objectives in coordinating economic policy even further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be disastrous for us to act recklessly and even worse for countries to consider themselves above an agreement which disciplines us all for the sake of a stable eurozone. Having said that, I am and have always been in favour of an intelligent and flexible interpretation. Clearly there is room for improvement. I am sure the Commission recognises this. The economic cycle calls for more than an annual disapproval. Monitoring over such a short period of time is incompatible with real-time analysis. I am sympathetic to Mr Santos' view that the cyclically adjusted deficit approved over the economic cycle is both sensible and prudent. Growth and stability are twin pillars. The Lisbon Summit gave voice to the possibility of a single market which was matched by investment in training and release of capital through the use of the financial services action plan, complemented by the risk capital action plan. However, we are still falling behind competitively. There are no high walls to keep the market out. The EU is increasingly in danger of being left out. The risk to the Community of not tackling substantial structural reforms is too great to be ignored. If we delay now, that will worsen, not ameliorate, economic downturns.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's discussions have been entertaining and humorous in many respects. In particular I thank Mr Olle Schmidt for the view that Sweden will join the euro and hopefully set a very good example for the UK, which will join very shortly afterwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maastricht criteria or not, these two Member States have taken it on themselves to increase their deficits in order to support capitalist ventures in their countries. The attitude of the French Government demonstrates how France and Germany will respond to the injunctions of the European institutions, if they do so at all. They may perhaps reduce their budgetary deficits, but they will not do so by reducing the considerable sums of money they give to employers.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, this amounts to at least 10% of the budget. There is certainly scope for making good a 3.4% deficit. In order to avoid reducing the money allocated to business, however, the French Government is cutting public spending. In truth, this means taking money away from public services. The requirement to balance the budget will mean less money for hospitals and schools. The population as a whole will suffer so that the wealthy can get away scot-free.</p>

In other words, we are concerned here with competition between economic solutions and, above all, with the best solutions to emerge from competition between the EU governments. That also ties in with the basic idea of subsidiarity in Europe. To put it in plain language, there should simply be no further increase in cooperation concerning economic policy, meaning that macro-economic policy ought quite simply not to fall within the competence of the EU. Socio-political objectives too, such as bringing about full employment, promoting social cohesion or establishing a balanced relationship between competition and public service are contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and competition. Moreover, we should – in my view, anyway – also take care that such objectives do not find their way into the EU constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we also need competition in the tax field, that is to say between European tax systems. Nor, above all, should we go on using the open coordination method in the form currently under discussion. In other words, we need, in the future too, an economic policy for which the Member States themselves continue to be responsible. In my view, only competition between economic policy objectives will, in the end, also lead to local conditions within the European Union that, against the background of general worldwide competition, may be further strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe we have dealt well with the Union’s two great instruments for coordinating economic policies, the broad guidelines for economic policies and the Stability and Growth Pact, instruments which, although they are linked, must not be confused.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that, since the Lisbon strategy was drawn up, the broad guidelines for economic policy have essentially been aimed at improving the Union’s growth potential. It is also the case that we often tend to compare what happens in the European Union with what happens in the United States in a rather simplistic way. We must not forget that, for example, it is not the same to compare growth in productivity in the United States and the European Union with growth in productivity per hour in the United States and the European Union. To put it another way, when we compare the United States with Europe, we know that in the United States the population is growing more, there is more active population and more hours are worked. There are clearly other factors involved in terms of productivity and which affect the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">This apart, however, there are two elements which I do believe to be important. They are both in our synthesis report. What has happened between 1999, when we launched the Lisbon process, and now? We have seen that, in terms of employment growth, the Union has grown more rapidly than in the past and we have come closer to the activity rate of the United States. Nevertheless, our productivity has decreased in comparison with the United States. This highlights that there are certain elements which are failing in the European Union, which are clearly related to the labour market in a broad sense, but which also relate to the deficiencies in the internal market, to the financial market, to lack of investments and to training and all those elements we have tried to introduce in the priorities, particularly for 2004, which we presented to the Spring Council, in order to improve our capacity and productivity in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, is the Stability and Growth Pact an obstacle to recovery in Europe? I believe not. I believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is a guarantee which will allow us, when we are able to improve our growth capacity and there is the possibility of growth, to make use of it in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact, by means of automatic stabilisers, has provided the Union with clear fiscal impetus. We must not forget that, in very broad simplistic terms, each point that activity falls implies more or less a half a point increase in public deficit, which is approximately double what usually happens in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Does a further discretional fiscal policy in the Union make sense? We believe that an asymmetric shock clearly raises problems which are not going to be resolved through elements of general taxation policy. Asymmetric shocks must be resolved through defining monetary policy and only in very exceptional circumstances does discretional fiscal policy make sense in the event of an asymmetric shock. However, we have introduced the room for manoeuvre into the pact which I referred to earlier, but we have introduced it in connection with that Lisbon growth potential.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that, in relation to the elements I have just mentioned with regard to the pact, you may say to me that these instruments count in those countries with budgetary positions below 3% in terms of deficit. And this is true. The Commission believes – and I am personally convinced – that the 3%, in nominal terms, should be the fundamental anchor of our entire system. We must define a reference which is untouchable for everybody and I believe that that is the reference we have to work on. But it is not a reference which we have defined and to which we are too stubbornly attached and which cannot be changed. Let us imagine simply what the budgetary situation would be in those countries which began with relatively low budgetary deficit definitions if we had allowed the growth in public deficit to function, as has happened in the United States for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that, in our system, those countries which exceed the 3%, at times with less fall in activity, must behave in a somewhat procyclic manner, but that situation is the result of not having fulfilled the obligations to reduce deficits in situations of higher growth. In summary, I believe the instruments we have will allow us to confront the current situation with a certain degree of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am asked whether we should be satisfied, I must say that we have made progress, but not that we should be entirely satisfied. You have raised some of the elements of concern to us all. You have said that it is essential that what is agreed is fulfilled. I completely agree with this principle and I believe it is one of the essential faults we currently have in our coordination system. Others have referred to the need to pay more attention to compliance with what is agreed and not to agree new things. This is why in the broad guidelines for economic policy we are paying much more attention to application reports than to the definition of new broad guidelines, which we propose should be tri-annual.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, however, we have also constantly insisted on the need to achieve greater ownership on the part of the various Member States. It is essential that the Member States accept and reiterate their commitment to complying with the Stability Pact and that that commitment is not simply formal, but that it is made reality. Only if we are able to make progress on all these elements will we have a departure point which will allow us to grow rapidly when the economic context changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our fundamental balances are in a relatively comfortable position at the moment. We are aware that our growth rates are relatively low. We are aware that we are being very much affected by external factors and that we have not been capable of being more independent from them, but we believe this is an excellent departure point for confronting the problems which may arise in the future and for taking advantage of opportunities for growth in the best possible way at the point when they arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
