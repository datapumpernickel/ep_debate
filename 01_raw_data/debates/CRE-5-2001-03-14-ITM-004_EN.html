The Lisbon Summit was held about a year ago. Everyone, including myself, considers that Lisbon was a major success. The summit linked together a number of policy areas – economic policy, employment and social policy – making them mutually dependent. We know that both employment and welfare depend on economic growth. But there is also dependence in the opposite direction: the way in which we design welfare is important for employment and growth. Social policy is a productive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago the Commission submitted an excellent document ahead of Lisbon. This time, there is also a document which in some respects is excellent but I do have to criticise the Commission on one point. I have no objections to the factual content, but I find the document unbalanced. The speech of President Prodi today was balanced, but the Commission’s document is far too focused on the economic aspects. I would have liked to see more attention paid to employment and social policy. In the same way, I hope that economic policy is not allowed to dominate at the Stockholm Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to address questions such as full employment, employment in general, quality at work – which encompasses the working environment, skills development and influence on the part of employees – lifelong learning, which is incredibly important, and the demographic development which should result in older people also being given the opportunity to develop and to retain their jobs. Finally, the Stockholm and Gothenburg Summits should also be linked and, in the future, environmental issues should be integrated in this process with economic policy, employment policy and other policy. It is particularly important to incorporate the ecological issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we may be forgiven for presuming to think that it is not so much a question of the excellence of that agenda as of its proper implementation nationally, in other words how the Member States carry through the processes of change, how they reconcile them with quality of life and work, and how they apply the strategy of greater social cohesion. Because the Commission admits, if only indirectly, that those are the real problems, when it talks about the 14 million who continue to be jobless and wonders whether enough has been done at national level. Equally, when it condemns the low skill levels of the labour force, one has to wonder whether the national training systems are put together properly, and whether educational reform, where implemented, is consistent with exploitation of the particular features of an area and whether it helps it to achieve greater cohesion, so that opportunity is open to all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission likewise condemns the existence of poverty and marginalisation in the Union. It would therefore be appropriate to check, in the area of employment policies, whether local partnership initiatives capable of producing investment in initial stages in order to speed up bureaucratic processes, infrastructure allocations and negotiated labour flexibility are consistent with national employment plans and are actually being implemented. It would also be appropriate to check, with regard to the same policies, whether the State aid granted, even if increased in the future, is really consistent with the local employment system criterion adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the liberalised public services, pending verification of the final benefits to the user, it would be appropriate to consider whether the new jobs are numerically and qualitatively equal to those lost and whether the opening up of the markets involved is at least consistent with the integration of rural, remote, and mountainous areas with urban centres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concerns the right regulatory environment; colleagues will have copies of the text. Now it is not surprising that, in the ten pages here, the section on the right regulatory environment is by far the shortest. The Commission has not even been able to find one page of good things to say about it! And why, colleagues, is that? Because despite all the fine words about having a deregulatory model, about creating jobs, about freeing up business, about – I quote – making the European Union the cheapest and the easiest place to do business, in the year since Lisbon we have seen a catalogue of failure on almost every front.</p>
<p class="contents">Take my own country, which claims to be in the lead of the new economy. Every business organisation and every survey confirms that more and more regulation and red tape has been piled on British business over the last twelve months. When I go and see companies in my constituency they say to me: "Mr Harbour, we have reached the stage now where politicians are spending more time sending us new regulations about protecting and looking after our existing employees than actually encouraging us to create new jobs".</p>
<p class="contents">I took notes throughout the speech by the President of the Council this morning and the question of deregulation was not mentioned once! But what did she mention? On top of everything that was agreed at Lisbon we are going to have a new ecological dimension to this programme and, far from the virtuous circle that Mr Goebbels was talking about this morning, we have a vicious circle. Once we actually created new jobs; we are now looking for new burdens to place on business in the new ecological dimension!</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention one point to President Prodi concerning an important conference on the economy two weeks ago, to which he kindly invited me along with other Members. (He might have invited me in December, by the way, when he invited everybody else but I did get my invitation about two weeks beforehand). I was able to go to a short part of it and, across the European economy, businesses from every country were saying if we are going to achieve the e-economy, do not over-regulate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it seems to us that the documents which will be submitted to the Stockholm European Council may be excessively numerous and that we may have to make more progress in preparing for these meetings. A large number of documents is not necessarily the best guarantee of a future strategy. From this perspective, I would like to recall the proposals made by Parliament for a merger between the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee. I think there is food for thought here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are gratified moreover by the adoption of a restricted list of structural indicators. It is the right course to follow for progress to be made at European level. To simply talk about structural reforms does not mean very much; we need to know which reforms we are talking about. And it seems to us that everything that concerns human investment must be of paramount importance. Structural reforms must be based first and foremost on the notion of human investment. Faced with an ageing population, which you referred to, Mr Prodi, it seems to us that we neglect at our peril investment in education, in mobility, in languages, in lifelong learning, and in research too, which you mentioned when you spoke just now on patents and Galileo.</p>
<p class="contents">President of the Commission, allow me to remind you, however, of the commitments we undertook, especially in Nice, regarding the social agenda. It seems to us that this is a very important issue on which we must make progress in the European Union, including at the Stockholm European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely important debate because less than a year ago we committed ourselves to nothing less than turning Europe into the most competitive and dynamic area of stability in the world. Nothing less than that. However, the 2010 horizon is looking stormy because the reticence of some countries to carry out liberalisation programmes approved by everybody and the resistance of States such as France to losing some of the flagships of its public sector are creating a two-speed Europe, a Europe in which countries which fulfil their collective commitments see their progress threatened by suspiciously aggressive strategies from companies, which are still public, in relation to recently liberalised sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a lot is at stake, but above all the legitimacy of the Community institutions is at stake in the eyes of the European citizens, who see the spread of a dangerous dynamic which favours the directors of powerful companies and which yields few results.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think Stockholm is so important. Stockholm must mark the beginning of a thorough debate on public participation in key industrial sectors. This debate must take place within the framework of a mutual process of evaluation and learning which will contribute to improving the operation of the single market. Based on a scoreboard of objective indicators for privatisation, this debate must bring together the different attitudes to the principles of competition, freedom of establishment and free movement of capital. This debate is being demanded by the European citizens who, having accepted competition as an effective method for allocating resources, are seeing their markets subjected to inefficiencies imported from countries which are ideologically allergic to economic reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Madam President-in-Office, Stockholm must hold on to the objective of full employment. That also means that that 3% growth must remain on the agenda and that hence productive investments must be made, not only in the knowledge society but also in social services and in people. This must be clearly reflected in the employment guidelines. I welcome the interim goals but these must also be included in the economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: full employment, to us, means quality jobs. And however important coordination methods are, it is important that a clear link is established with the social agenda, social legislation and social agreements in this connection. I set great store by the fact that you have invited the Commission to formulate objectives for the right to lifelong learning, but it would be equally important, Madam President-in-Office, if the Council were to invite the social partners to at long last reach agreements on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: Stockholm must be the summit where quality equals equality. That means that we should not only talk about labour participation of the elderly, however important that is, but also of women. Stockholm should therefore focus on improving the quality of the so-called atypical jobs, on reconciling work and family, redistributing the work, a strategy of equal pay for equal work, and child care.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly: Stockholm must first and foremost be a social summit which does not reduce everything to labour market policy, however important that may be, but also maps out courses for the future with regard to social cohesion and solidarity. I so much hope, Madam President-in-Office, that Stockholm will prove crucial in the strategy of open coordination in terms of social exclusion and social protection, so that the Belgian Presidency can outline clear and ambitious objectives in this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lindh, the texts are, in my opinion, not wholly satisfactory, but I hope that in the time left available to us, the missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will fall into place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council decided to create the most dynamic economic area in the world. That was a year ago. Are we any closer to the plans? We have certainly become more competitive, including in new technologies. The Member States have started on numerous structural reforms. Unemployment has been reduced to a large – but not by any means full – extent. Unfortunately, adequate economic and social cohesion between the regions has still not been achieved. What we expect of the Swedish Presidency is an initiative to develop intelligent instruments for investigating qualitative and quantitative progress. Benchmarking and gender-specific statistics should give us information which needs to be evaluated every year. What we certainly do not need is to adopt the Swedish social model for Europe. What we need are real measures to increase employability and ensure that the younger members of the workforce, women wishing to return to work and the long-term employed are better qualified. The socially disadvantaged must be better integrated into working life and discrimination in employment and the workplace must be nipped in the bud.</p>
<p class="contents">Just how important it is to stop excluding older employees is something which you felt deserved a mention here today, Mr President of the Commission. We must work and act across the generational divide and we must convince young people that it is worthwhile working together with older people on this project, so that we can create social insurance systems which are fundable, meaning that balanced budgets are needed in the Member States. All this presupposes the full support of the social partners. Anne Van Lancker is right, however; we also need agreements between them and NGOs, the representatives of civil society and, of course, the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next week in Stockholm, on the eve of the summit, there will also be a summit of the social partners. It will be taking place in the midst of something of a crisis for social dialogue, because the employers seem set to walk away from attempts to negotiate improved employment rights for workers placed by temporary employment agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very serious issue. In the framework of Stockholm we need to look very seriously at the importance of the social partners in improving flexibility for our enterprises, whilst at the same time safeguarding workers in or moving between those enterprises. That is what we are promised in the adaptability pillar of the employment strategy and what should be delivered by the Lisbon process. But unfortunately the reality in my region and elsewhere in the Union is that workers placed by temporary employment agencies are placed at a severe disadvantage. They are paying the price of improved flexibility for enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Employers have to be made to recognise their responsibilities. If they are determined to walk away from these negotiations, the Commission must make it absolutely clear that it will take immediate legislative action and the Stockholm Summit should make it clear that the Council will do everything it can to expedite the legislative instrument to cover workers placed by temporary employment agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not content with trying to control us at home, he is trying to do that in Europe as well. He came back to the UK saying that Europe is going our way and that he had changed the agenda. However, as far as I can see, the only way in which Europe is following Mr Blair's agenda is by piling yet more red tape on business and more regulation, and making Europe an ever more expensive place in which to do business.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair's government introduced about 3500 regulations last year alone – a record increase. The lessons of Lisbon have not been learned in London or Brussels, because we still see every day in this House more regulation and more red tape being produced.</p>
<p class="contents">I challenge both Commissioner Prodi and Mrs Lindh to come up with one example of where a burden on business has been removed or repealed since Lisbon, one example of an EU measure which makes it easier and not more difficult and more expensive to employ people and one example of a proposal for a regulation which has been dropped as being too expensive or disproportionate to the aims sought.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I will be proved wrong in my assessment of the success rate from Lisbon being very low indeed. We still have directives on how to climb ladders. We still have directives on lawnmowers, fluorescent ballast and one on electrical waste which is quite simply going to be a tax on computers. How is that going to promote the e-economy in Europe? Regulation may feel like cost-free political points to politicians, but someone has to pay the bill. The people who pay the bills are the customers of these companies, who pay them in higher prices and, above all, the people of Europe, who are priced out of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission and the Council to live up to the fine words of Lisbon with action: remove red tape and, above all, make it easier, not more difficult or expensive to employ people in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These preconditions are generally not met in the EU, despite the Lisbon Declaration. First, we are very short of engineers and scientists: retraining in science is an essential part of lifelong learning. Secondly, only two Member States – Sweden, luckily, and Finland – spend more than 3% of GDP on research and they have the industrial competitiveness which accompanies that expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Foresight and dissemination will, of course, be helped by the forthcoming Sixth Framework Programme and even more by the creation of the European research area, with its networking of centres of excellence. Without Member State commitment at Stockholm, the knowledge-based economy simply will not happen. So I say to Member States: "Over to you at Stockholm.

<p class="contents">The Council summit in Stockholm will have to take decisions on matters relating to education and research. We need to speed up the rate of development of the electronic learning sector. Innovations and new multimedia and Internet technologies will give us the tools we need for distance learning both for general education and for training and lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Stockholm Summit, we shall need to start systematically monitoring electronic learning, bringing together indicators to control equal access of pupils and non-pupils to information and communications technologies and taking measures to combat geographical, social and cultural inequalities. On the other hand, lifelong learning is a prime means for the European economy of allowing the human resources which we need for a knowledge society to respond and develop. We need to bear the social cost of these policies in the conviction that they will bring in maximum returns, for the benefit of the European social and cultural model.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European research area must be given form and substance by coordinating activities and policies in the research area and supporting both basic research and pioneering technologies. We need to increase spending in order to catch up with the USA and we need better, more efficient relations between research and science and public opinion and the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to comment on some of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to say that I agree with Mr Suominen that it is important not only to have words, but also to have action. For this reason, I believe that an annual assessment and follow-up of the targets is a new and unique process which will hopefully mean that we really become better at ensuring that words are translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for such a positive picture of Europe. I agree that it is important also to spread the view and picture that things are going well for Europe. I agree that it is important for us to combine economic and social measures. That is, in fact, what this whole debate has been about. Some speakers have talked about economic aspects, others about social aspects. What will make us able, in fact, to <span class="italic">modernise </span>and not just liberalise Europe is our ability to combine economic reforms and social reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Herman Schmid addressed the problem of there being a “right-wing policy” when we talk about economic goals and economic reforms. I cannot understand this. Obviously, a strong economy is vital for welfare. In addition, we have clearly prioritised the fight against unemployment and we emphasise the importance of raising employment targets, which I see as crucial issues for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Andersson, Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs O’Toole said. They stressed that, if we are to be competitive, we must also ensure that we focus on education and social issues. Lifelong learning is an important issue for Europe. Our citizens must receive sufficient training and so achieve good skills. We have already talked about the participation of older people in the labour market. Mrs Van Lancker also mentions the position of women in the labour market. Mr Andersson mentions environmental technology. All this is vital if we are to achieve our targets regarding competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour complained that I did not address the issue of deregulation. In my statement, I nonetheless said that we must open up the markets for electricity, gas, post, rail traffic and air traffic and that we must have a common market for financial services by 2005 and a common market for venture capital by 2003. If Mr Harbour does not feel that <span class="italic">this</span> is important for economic development in Europe, I really do not know what he feels is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Thomas Mann addressed the significance of our also evaluating our targets, which I commented on in the introduction. I agree with this, although we do not perhaps agree entirely on the Swedish social model, but we will no doubt continue to discuss this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hughes addressed the important issue of workplaces which do not meet basic requirements regarding labour law, safety, etc. This applies to matters such as temporary agency work. This is an important issue which we are mainly discussing on a national basis, but which obviously also has to be discussed with regard to the future. Particularly when we talk about quality of work and the importance of establishing social targets, I believe we have the opportunity to take up this issue of temporary agency work within the framework of the European Council in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking you for an excellent debate. I hope that we will have a good summit in Stockholm. I am also convinced that Parliament will continue to ensure that there will be action, not just words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But everyone is also in agreement in warning of the crucial need to accelerate the rate of progress. We are going too slowly, we have missed opportunities, and so, Madam President, what I ask is that we press on together, at Stockholm, at a rapid pace and with a minimum of anger and tension because, although we are in agreement, all too often commitments made are not put into practice.
