<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moreau </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, with one million five hundred thousand employees and a hundred thousand post offices serving the public, postal services play a leading role in employment and social cohesion. The European Parliament, after eight years of work seeking to involve the social players, did much to slow down the process of liberalisation which the European Commission sought in its initial proposals. How, therefore, can we fail to take a keen interest in the Commission"s stated intention of stepping up the liberalisation of postal services, even before Directive 97/67 has been transposed into national law? Such important matters require a full understanding of the options for future developments, and the consideration of precise information. Our group is therefore urging Parliament to reject any new liberalisation measure and asking that any revision of the regulatory framework provided for by the directive should be preceded by a review of all the consequences of implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not time, in this sector as in others, that the Commission abandoned its blind insistence on inflexibly and dogmatically applying principles which are based on one theory alone: that liberalisation is the right thing and must be taken as far as possible? On the other side of the fence from dogmas of this kind there are men and women who want a quality service, and others who work in it. One cannot fail to note a number of common trends in sectors which have already been liberalised. In transport in particular, for example, thousands of jobs have been lost and staff earnings and conditions of employment are under threat. Everyone will agree that it is essential to have the proper information at one"s disposal before taking any new decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, there is an urgent need for serious and thorough studies of the consequences of liberalisation, in the area of jobs, regional development, the economic and financial balance of operators, and the quality of the services provided. Recent studies of this kind carried out by the Commission have been strongly criticised by the European Joint Committee on Postal Services. If there is to be proper transparency and the conclusions of these studies are to be fully credible, they must be carried out with the cooperation of all the players, operators, trade union organisations and postal service users in the Member States. Looking at the commercial and financial offensive currently being mounted by private multinationals in the postal services market, one can be forgiven for thinking that their prime concern is not to provide a public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, we stress the need for everyone to have equal access to postal services, under the same fair conditions, regardless of location, and consequently the need to foster the development of cooperation, of understanding, and not war between national and European operators. In emphasising the importance of these services, I must stress that the service they provide to users cannot be treated simply as a commodity governed by the laws of the market, because it is part of a fundamental human right, the right to communicate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Taubira‐Delannon </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Europe"s postal services are big business: with a turnover of 360 billion francs, they handle a total of 108 billion items, their network comprises more than 106 000 contact points, but above all they employ 1 400 000 people and have more than 370 million potential users.</p>
<p class="contents">The main question is therefore whether there can be a single formula, a harmonious formula, for situations which are different: different in population terms to start with, because the areas and densities are not comparable, and four countries account for 60 % of the population; different in economic terms, with a per capita GDP ranging from less than 90 000 francs to over 150 000 francs and four countries accounting for 75 % of the turnover; different in financial terms, with a basic charge varying from 1.70 francs to 3.20 francs; and lastly, different in legal terms, with very different geographical situations and products covered.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, a number of principles have to be upheld: the principle of a fair and just universal service, the principle of economic effectiveness, and the principle of cohesion and maintenance of the public service. In other words, we must not give hallowed status to competition on the pretext of transparency, which would penalise the most deprived and the most remote users. In other words, we must ensure proper safeguards for jobs and for the general interest.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, listening to the arguments put forward in these two last speeches, I feel as if I have gone back in time and am reminded of our very first discussions on liberalising telecommunications services. The same fears were voiced then, although the dread scenario never came about. On the question of a universal service, we did describe certain financial instruments that the Member States would be authorised to use, including in the telecommunications sector. But a universal service is, for the most part, being provided without recourse to these instruments, solely on the basis of the economic laws naturally governing the operation of communications systems. These laws are clearly so alien to some Members and political groupings in this House that anguish grips them at every turn.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be perfectly clear on this, Mrs Moreau. Provided a market functions according to rules – and these can and should be laid down as part of a political process – there is no reason for an anti‐social climate to arise. On the contrary, if that market is run according to the rules which we ourselves set – and I am a logical man – the consequences certainly need not in any sense be socially damaging. Just consider prices in the telephony sector. Thank goodness we say ‘prices" and not ‘tariffs" nowadays. Because of competition – in other words, thanks to the market – by the end of this year we shall probably have prices that are every bit as favourable as in the USA. Ordinary communications, together with access to the Internet and other information sources, will be readily affordable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is social policy at its best. The system is perfectly straightforward. It is no longer a matter of measuring need against yardsticks, with large bureaucracies doling out money at great administrative expense – and at the risk of fraud – to those who fit the criteria. Today it is possible, Mrs Moreau, to telephone free of charge. You need not pay anything at all; you can ring me up whenever you like – but not at night, please.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Mr President, this is the second time that I have been up and active at unearthly hours in this Chamber. I would ask you to take note that I shall be looking at the possibility of establishing a trade union for Commissioners. Things cannot go on like this. We are being forced to work under inhuman working conditions. My human dignity is at stake, Mrs Moreau.</p>
<p class="contents">As to your questions, Madam, I really cannot answer them, unfortunately, and I will tell you why. You understandably raised these issues because you felt the time had come for plain speaking. The trouble is, I have not reached any final conclusions yet myself. You are not happy with the studies that were carried out because the results do not match your particular vision, but there is not much I can do about that. We aimed to base our research on information from all postal operators around the Union, but I will be frank with you: sadly, not all of them provided us with the necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling: It was not delivered!) </span></p>
<p class="contents">That may well be so. In any event, I am still working on my own final position, which will be submitted to the Commission at a meeting in about two weeks" time.</p>
<p class="contents">At that meeting, there will be a general policy discussion and I will endeavour to gather the views of my colleagues on the various issues. Then, and only then, will I be in a position to indicate provisionally where we intend to go in some of these areas. There can be no question of my coming out with a Commission position as such today. What I can say, wearing a purely personal hat, is that we shall be modelling our approach to the universal service requirement on the method which has been applied in the telecommunications sector. The principle is to provide a kind of safety net, if colleagues can follow my drift. Although there will be no obligation, it will be made available for Member States if they feel the need to use it. I myself do not see the need for such a provision, but so be it. We are in the habit of taking seriously even unjustified fears, and will probably be making a proposal along these lines – or I shall be, at any rate. You can therefore go to bed with a calm conscience. Let us hope, however, that the postal services people will soon be up and about.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Simpson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the oral question on postal services and the subsequent wind‐up motions give this Parliament an opportunity to reaffirm its often stated position on the future of postal services in the European Union. It is also a great coincidence that this subject is being discussed on the same agenda that Parliament is considering the motion of censure on the Commission. One of the reasons for the deterioration in Parliament/Commission relations without doubt has been the arrogant attitude sometimes displayed by certain Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">We experienced that ourselves in 1997, and I think we are about to experience it again in 1999, when Parliament overwhelmingly supported the report I put forward but it was dismissed at that time by Commissioner Bangemann with the words that he would return to pursue his highly liberalised plans – plans that have been rejected by Parliament. Let me remind Commissioner Bangemann of Parliament's position. Perhaps in this new spirit of reverence and respect for Parliament which seems to be sweeping the Commission this week, he will take note and ensure that Parliament's position is fully included when he finally gets round to presenting us – late – with the new postal directive that is being worked on at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see a reserved area large enough to sustain a viable universal service. That includes keeping direct mail and cross‐border mail in the reserved area. That reserved area is the responsibility of the national postal administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see a reserved area based on a realistic weight limit, not the 20 grammes, or even the 50 grammes which is rumoured to be the view of the Commission. We want to see a detailed definition of what a universal service is and we want to know what the social effects of liberalisation will be on employment on jobs and on the quality of service that is delivered to the people of the European Union. Reminding the Commissioner of the thousands of jobs involved and also reminding him that Parliament has severe doubts, as Mrs Moreau mentioned, about the authenticity of previous so‐called studies in this and other areas. We frankly believe they are rigged. Florus, you will get your chance in a minute, so stop whining and belly‐aching at the back.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still awaiting this Commission proposal, in line with Directive 97/67/EC, which means that the articles relating to liberalisation of the previous directive may no longer apply. When, oh when, will the Commission recognise that you cannot compare fairly telecoms and post because, as we have often said, telecoms is about machines, and post is about people. But we still have this great difficulty in getting that between the ears of the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament knows I am a reasonable man. But I say tonight to the Commissioner and the Commission in general that whether that Commission has one day or one year left to run, if you come to Parliament with a postal directive which attacks the concept of a publicly accountable universal service of high quality for all, if you come to Parliament having dismissed – as you have done in the past – or ignored – as you have also done in the past – Parliament's previously stated position, a position supported by the Council, and if you persist in enforcing a dogmatic, totally liberalised approach to the detriment of the postal services, then you are in for a monumental battle: a mother and father of all battles. Be warned, Commissioner, Parliament's position has not changed. Parliament is still of the same view with the exception of the lunatic fringe of the Dutch liberals. What you need to do is to listen to what Parliament is saying to you, listen to what the people in the European Union want and stop this folly of trying to liberalise the postal services purely on a dogmatic basis.</p>

I would point out to Mr Simpson that he was speaking there on behalf of the Socialist Group, not of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are again, sitting late into the night and having to acknowledge once more that the Commission has problems getting the timing right when it comes to directives. This is not the first sitting at which the Commission has had to be asked how much headway has been made. A fresh proposal for a directive was supposed to have been submitted by the end of 1998. That deadline has been allowed to pass. As I have stated on several occasions in the past, Commissioner, you cannot expect the legislative process to run smoothly unless you meet the timetables. You have forfeited the chance to produce long‐overdue proposals on enhancing the quality of the EU"s postal services. With proper competition, costs could be brought down and the system made capable of matching alternatives such as fax or e‐mail.</p>
<p class="contents">If you did not act for fear of the left‐wing majority in the Council, then I have little sympathy. If you failed to deliver because you are not happy with the way the Member States are transposing the directive, then that means that the Commission has not fulfilled its duty as guardian of the treaties. And whilst on this topic, I note with interest the provenance of the three questioners; their countries seem to have a particular problem with transposing this directive, although it has been officially adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore appeal to you, Mr Bangemann, to come back to Parliament as soon as possible with a committed proposal for a further directive. The old one called for an intelligent approach to the development of our postal services, and I trust that this will be forthcoming in the near future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wijsenbeek </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as we have heard in the debate this evening, everyone knows our position. Some people may call us the lunatic fringe, but we are standing up for consumers, because they are entitled to a better service. The postal service must not be seen as a welfare service, nor must it be used by countries to provide services that belong elsewhere. We all know that as soon as postal services are put in a monopoly position, they tend to be sidelined by faxes, e‐mails and other modern media.</p>
<p class="contents">It also appears in practice, in countries like Sweden, for example, or the Netherlands – and Sweden is not a small, densely populated country like the Netherlands, it is an enormous place covering huge distances – that a privatised service or a service where competition is possible can be just as good as the inefficient monopolies that also provide social services. This is why we are calling on the Commission not only to implement the old, outdated directive as soon as possible, but also to put forward new proposals on liberalising the sector. This is what the Commission undertook to do. The failure of Reims II and the failure to achieve full compliance because all sorts of integrators are now at work means that we need to come up with proposals for a new, modern service. I hope that the Commission is not going to take another ten years over this and that it does not produce another white elephant like the last time. Any resemblance to persons here present is, of course, entirely accidental.</p>

What an interesting thought!</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I am rather surprised at the way the Commission has acted in this case. In general, I am not opposed to privatisation and nor is my political group. But why is the Commission in such a tearing hurry? On the contrary, Parliament has already asked the Commission to assess the economic and social consequences, as well as the state of the postal sector, on a country by country basis. However, this has not been done.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also said that in evaluating the effect of liberalisation on postal services, account should be taken not only of the Commission's own feasibility studies, but also of Parliament's consultations, postal sector trade unions, user organisations and so on. If that had been done, Mr Bangemann would not be able to say that our concern is unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my colleagues has already mentioned that some liberalisation of postal services has taken place in Sweden. However, studies show that the quality of services has deteriorated in the more remote areas, that there has been ‘cherry picking', and that postal services in villages are not as good as they used to be. Naturally, the postal sector has to be large enough to maintain the quality of what is, after all, a public service.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it would be totally inappropriate to put forward new legislative proposals without having some idea of what their overall consequences would be and without carrying out a general overhaul of the sector at the same time. So there is no hurry, and it would be better to take our time.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schmidbauer </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Bangemann himself said, this is by no means the first time that we have sat in this House at midnight discussing the question of European postal services. And today"s debate will doubtless not be the last – although a better slot next time round would be nice. We as a parliament clearly cannot overemphasise our position on liberalising postal services. No one in the European Parliament would dispute the need for a functioning single market in the postal sector; we shall therefore need to expand on the existing market liberalisation directive within a reasonable time frame. The differences of view among ourselves and with the Commission begin over when to take action and how much liberalising should be carried out. At the time of the majority decision on the current directive, that was certainly the case.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us take a close look at the timetable set for the new version of the directive. It was adopted in 1997 and was due for transposition in the Member States by the end of 1998, although quite a number of countries have yet to take the necessary steps. The directive also called upon the Commission to submit fresh proposals for further liberalisation by the end of 1998. It would, however, be rather strange to start revising the directive before the consequences of the original have been properly assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that Parliament endorsed this schedule at the end of 1997, but what is the point of amending a directive that has not yet even been put into effect in all the Member States? The Commission first needs to submit a report detailing the state of play on transposition and – most importantly – comparing the measures put in place in individual countries. It will certainly emerge that there are some considerable discrepancies. Once the facts are established, action can be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">If the directive is to be amended, two sets of guarantees will be required. We must be able to rely on an efficient universal service, with a solid financial base. And the postal sector must continue to offer jobs with proper social security coverage. You cannot reasonably make comparisons with the telecommunications sector, Mr Bangemann. As Mr Simpson said, technology pretty much holds sway there, whereas the workforce – the human factor – is far more significant in the postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a universal service is capable of ensuring that each and every European citizen, however remote his or her place of residence, has access to postal facilities. Only then can we speak of ‘communication". Our postal services fulfil a social remit; it is not just a matter of providing a commercial service. This remit is to offer the people of Europe an affordable and readily usable means of communicating. It is therefore not enough to equip the Greek islands and more isolated villages in the Bavarian forests with computer terminals. These regions need real letter boxes, which will be emptied daily.</p>
<p class="contents">A universal service of this kind needs a solid financial foundation – which it will be denied if the reserved area is broken up, opening the way for commercial suppliers to pick the cherries out of the cake. Instead, what is required is a system whereby postal undertakings offer a range of services, including non‐profitable ones. The universal service and reserved area dimension can then benefit from cross‐funding. Nor should we forget the 1.5 million people employed in the European postal sector, for whom we bear a social responsibility. It is common knowledge that the process of postal liberalisation to date has been painful for the workforce, accompanied as it was by redundancies and switches to often socially insecure conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I doubt that any political group would argue with me when I say that this parliament will not stand idly by while the postal service suppliers turn their workplaces little by little into production lines. We will not countenance quick profits for the companies at the expense of employees and quality. We demand guarantees that a comprehensive and high‐quality universal postal service, offering proper job security, will survive.</p>

This has led to the deregulation and liberalisation of one sector after another. Unfortunately, the postal services are a major exception to the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of EU countries have already moved so far in the direction of free competition that they have extended it to the postal sector, and they can point to satisfactory results. In Sweden, the process has gradually assumed a political significance of its own. It is essential that encouragement should be given to its continuation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having filled you in briefly on the background, I should now like to put a question to Mr Bangemann which should wind up this debate: what measures is the Commission thinking of taking in order to further the process of liberalisation in the postal sector?</p>

What Mr Stenmarck asked illustrates the confusion besetting this debate. The Commission has not yet decided what measures it will take. Not, Mr Ferber, because I am frightened of the Left – or indeed of anyone else. I am not even in fear of Mr Stoiber, unlike some CSU members seeking re‐election to this House. I do not aspire to have my name on the CSU list, and this spares me the need to draw attention to myself with fiery rhetoric. Nobody frightens me – not even you, Mr Ferber.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Simpson seems to hold a very simplistic view of the relations linking Parliament, the Commission and the Council. He has got things the wrong way round if he thinks that the Commission should always make proposals which match Parliament"s vision. The procedure is that the Commission proposes, then Parliament and the Council deliver their positions. The Commission of course takes on board the results of this democratic process. Our own right to propose would be totally undermined, however, if I or any of my Commission colleagues were systematically to advocate what Parliament wanted – particularly since you will have noticed that the parliamentary position is not clear at this stage. And how could it be? The Commission has yet to make a proposal. Once it has done so, we can see what Parliament has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat, however, for the sake of clarity: my personal intention – and I can speak only on my behalf at this juncture – is to defend the universal service. So you need have no worries, provided my colleagues in the Commission follow my lead. What I cannot do is come forward with a proposal which would rule out extending the liberalisation process to the postal sector; nor can I advocate delay, since our postal services would simply end up being overtaken by developments elsewhere. This is a point I have endeavoured to drive home in previous debates; once you have grasped it, you will understand that I am not ‘out to get" those employed in the postal sector. We can already see competition developing between those postal service providers who operate in a liberalised environment – Deutsche Post AG, for example – and the others who do not. The former enjoy a natural advantage born of their market fitness. They will be better placed legally as well, free as they are to buy up or merge with other companies; that door is closed to the monopolies. Anyone who fails to comprehend that will truly be letting down postal employees – and Mr Wijsenbeek"s consumers – alike.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about ideology. Very well, I am a Liberal and have been all my life. Occasionally one wonders if one"s colleagues on the Liberal benches have the same degree of common sense; be that as it may, I have certainly never abandoned my Liberal convictions. It is not ideology which spurs me on – I see nothing Liberal in ideological positions; my aim is to do the job entrusted to me. If you are not happy with the way I perform, Mr Simpson, you have all the opportunity in the world to kick me out, along with my colleagues. It is fine by us; that is life on the democratic stage. You can do it tomorrow if you like; the opportunity is there if you so decide. I shall not be offended; Parliament will simply be doing its job. And if you refrain because you believe that the Commission has not done so badly, after all – then many thanks in advance.</p>
