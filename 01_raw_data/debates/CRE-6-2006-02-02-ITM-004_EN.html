<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in September 2001 that the Commission adopted the new White Paper entitled ‘European Transport Policy for 2010 – Time to Decide’, in which the prospects for development until that date were sketched out, and in which the Commission proposed some 60 different measures and an action programme with the main aim of making transport safer. Its presentation of the dossier we are debating today – on driving times and drivers’ rest periods and the associated directive on the monitoring of compliance with the conditions imposed by the first directive – did, of course, offer a good opportunity to turn good intentions into practical policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that the main question to ask when assessing what came out of the committee for conciliation between the Council and Parliament is whether the goals we have set ourselves have been achieved, the first of those being the improvement and harmonisation of professional drivers’ working conditions, the second being improved road safety and the third the creation of fair conditions under which all interested parties compete.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now proceed to set out the most important consequences of this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the time driven must not exceed nine hours in any given day, the second that it must not exceed 56 hours in a week and must not result in the maximum working time specified in the Working Time Directive being exceeded. Thirdly, total driving time over a period of two weeks must not exceed 90 hours. Fourthly, the regular daily rest period is equivalent to eleven hours, either consecutively or divided into two periods of three and nine hours respectively. This is in response to the desire for more flexibility expressed by the drivers, who will be able to use the rest periods in very different ways in the different climate conditions that prevail in winter and summer respectively. The fifth point is that the regulated rest time in a given week is fixed at a minimum of 45 hours, and the sixth that the report introduces the digital tachograph, thereby making possible extended and improved monitoring of compliance with the regulations. Seventhly, there are clear rules on the hauliers’ liability. Eighthly, the prescribed checking sample has been increased to 2% starting in 2008 and to 3% from 2010 onwards. The ninth point I want to make is that the checks must be carried out not only on the road but also on the company’s premises.</p>
<p class="contents">One can readily observe, from a comparison between the documents under consideration and those that formerly applied, that in no respect whatever have conditions been made worse. If, however, one weighs in the balance the results achieved with our initial conception of how things would turn out, one does come to a different conclusion in respect of certain of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a few examples, the first being that the regulation does not apply to vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes in weight, even though such vehicles are used to carry goods on more and more journeys, and are involved in more and more accidents. The second is that there are only two references to the Working Time Directive, yet compliance with its provisions is not monitored at the same time as compliance with the rules on driving times and rest periods. I do not believe that this goes anything like far enough to guarantee that drivers will be less likely to become over-tired or that it will be less likely that the maximum times will be exceeded, or that these things will not happen at all. Thirdly, although the annex to the monitoring directive includes a definition of what is meant by an offence against the regulation, this is not harmonised in any legally binding way. Fourthly, no provision is made for harmonised sanctions, with the consequence that the Member States can still impose different penalties for the same offence.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things considered, it can certainly be said that we have, together, come up with plenty of flexible solutions, and we do of course hope that this legislation will, during the planned period of two years, find its way into the new AETR and thus become applicable to those states that are not members of the European Union, but whose vehicles do use the EU’s roads, so that equality of competition may be established across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">As most of you know, I, in the conciliation committee, voted against the compromise we had achieved, and I did so out of the conviction that this House could have achieved more and that our majority on the committee was too hasty in calling a halt to negotiations with the Council. That being so, I can very definitely understand that there will be those taking part in today’s vote who are not among the advocates of this compromise. Although most of those affected by the regulation and the directive are not exactly jumping for joy, an absolute majority of them have expressed their support for the adoption of these two dossiers, and my vote will reflect that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask the Commission to do three things: firstly, to commission a study on the traffic patterns of goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes, for I live in hope of a different kind of lobbyism and of our being able to incorporate these categories, too, in the directive at a later date. Secondly, I would ask them to help coordinate the various bodies that monitor driving times, rest times and working times, and, thirdly, to organise, together with the Member States and the social partners, seminars on this new legislation in order to get it implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by extending the warmest thanks to all those who worked with me on this dossier over many years – from the Committee, primarily Mr Hauck and Mr Darmis – and also the shadow rapporteurs. We all worked together very well in a way that was rather unusual, but did turn out to be worth it. I would also like to thank our Vice-President Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who conducted the conciliation proceedings with a firm hand, and Mr Tziorkas, the official responsible for our case.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the digital tachograph will soon be introduced and that the Member States will make the driver cards available, so that we will then have made some progress in bringing a bit more social justice, safety and fair competition onto the European Union’s roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the substantial development of road transport during the last twenty years has led the Commission to present two texts. The first is a proposal for a regulation drafted in 2001 aimed at simplifying, clarifying and updating a regulation well-known among drivers – number 3820/85 – which stipulates driving times, rest periods and breaks for the latter. The second is a proposal for a directive drafted in 2003 aimed at replacing a directive dating from 1988. This proposal for a directive guarantees a minimum level of checks with regard to driving times and rest periods in the road transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We all worked with the aim of finalising this package on 6 December 2005, following a long and difficult negotiating process that will have lasted over two years. The conciliation committee finally reached an agreement. Parliament did a great deal to help move this matter forward, and I should like to congratulate the chairman of your delegation, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, to whom Mr Markov was keen to pay tribute. I should also like to pay special tribute to the work of Mr Markov, Mr Grosch and Mr Piecyk and of the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who paid a great deal of attention to the issues and who obtained real progress with regard to the text of the Council’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">A compromise was reached on two-thirds of Parliament’s amendments concerning the regulation and on more than half of Parliament’s amendments concerning the directive. I will take the example of the introduction of a Community system designed to establish a common and precise classification of offences according to their seriousness. Harmonisation of this kind will enable us to clarify the obligations imposed by the rules, from the point of view both of industry and of inspectors throughout the whole of Europe. I stress ‘the whole of Europe’ and not just the European Union. Thanks to Parliament’s insistence, the Council and the Commission committed themselves to ensuring that the AETR Agreement can be ratified by the other European countries, including Russia, and this within two years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we did not manage to include control of working time in the scope of the new directive. I can, however, assure you that the Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that the working time directive is applied in full. On 19 December, the Commission also sent ten reasoned opinions to the Member States that had not yet notified full transposition of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the conciliation procedure has enabled further progress to be made. This legislative package is going to bring about a number of benefits and advances with regard to the current situation. I am certain of that. I will mention a few examples: clear and simple limits in relation to weekly driving times, which make the text easier to understand and, of course, enable us more effectively to monitor whether it is being complied with; a clear and explicit commitment in favour of harmonising the information systems, the technical features of the equipment, the classification of risks and the interpretation of rules; and finally, of course, the increase in controls, the extraterritoriality of penalties and accountability throughout the transport chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I should again like to stress, Mr President, that this progress has for the most part been obtained thanks to Parliament’s interventions. On the ground, the checks will be more coordinated and more effective. It is not only a question of increasing them, but also of making them more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word on the digital tachograph. I should like to tell Parliament, in this Chamber this morning, just how useful it would be if the texts in question were approved because they are going to enable us to bring into effect the use of the digital tachograph. Parliament has agreed with the Council on a cut-off date for its introduction. Parliament and the Council have concluded a joint declaration on this matter. In anticipation of your agreement on the legislative package, I pointed out to the Transport Ministers from all the Member States, on 12 January 2006, that I, for my part, accepted extending the grace period until the cut-off date. I made this gesture in order to prevent any misunderstandings. However, it is clear that, over and above the date desired by the legislator – that is to say, by Parliament – any new lorry not equipped with the digital tachograph will risk incurring immediate penalties imposed by the national authorities, such as the vehicle being taken off the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov, you questioned me on three points. I should like to make it clear to you that the Commission immediately got down to work in order to provide you with the answers you are awaiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dare to hope that you will be able to endorse the outcome of this conciliation procedure and that, together, we will finally be able to close this matter more than two years after the Commission put forward its proposal. It would be a great pity if we were to hold up the progress contained in these texts, progress that will therefore be able, thanks to your vote, to be applied in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mathieu Grosch, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been through the conciliation procedure, the very name of which indicates that its purpose is to seek out compromises. It would be going too far for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – or anyone else, for that matter – to claim that the result is all that we would have hoped for. The essential question as regards the work that has been done on this at every level is whether this dossier is going in the right direction, whether certain goals we had set ourselves have been achieved. The answer I can give to that, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, is very definitely in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard driving times and drivers’ rest periods as a safety issue, and anything that highlights or improves safety as a step in the right direction, and it is for that reason that I would like to thank the rapporteur, the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and also the Commission, for I do believe that all of them – different though their expectations may have been – were working together with one end in mind. In that respect, we have done a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important forward step in that it has involved us analysing the vital measures to be taken at European level in relation to those countries whose vehicles also travel on European roads. We had, of course, expected rather more of that, but we have to bear in mind what is possible, and if we have got so far as to get, tomorrow, 42 countries – 25 EU Member States plus the other European states – to accept such things through the AETR agreement, then we have sent a clear message to the outside world where safety is concerned, for safety is what driving times and rest periods are all about, and that means the safety not just of drivers, but of all other road users too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also simplified and clarified certain terms. It was a curious experience to discover that, even though we were talking about driving times and rest periods in road transport, nobody had ever defined what is meant by ‘driving time’. We also, though, did more important things than that, in that we made it quite plain that the whole time spent either driving or resting must be capable of being monitored. More might, of course, have been expected, but the stipulation that sleeping time adds up to 9 hours plus 3, or 9 hours as such, then that is by far preferable to the 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 that applied before. I think that the proposals that the Council made in this respect were quire right too. A driver knows how much of a break he has to take after four and a half hours, whether it be 15 or 30 minutes, without all the rules that applied hitherto. Speaking as one who comes from a border area, I can say that you only have to imagine the thousands of people who are using the roads, speaking different languages, with different ways of expressing themselves, and so there have to be people to keep tabs on them all.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the journey recorders are concerned, we still have the old model of oral contact, with someone having to ask: what is actually meant by what the recorder says? Making these things capable of being checked – so that both the driver and the person doing the checking know what is coming to them – is, as I see it, a really important advance. I think we have made a few things in this connection abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a whole lengthy story behind the tachograph itself. We had already asked a few questions on behalf of the Commission, but we would have preferred to have wrapped up the whole business with the digital journey recorder as long ago as August 2004. I have to say, though, Commissioner, that your clear statements over the past weeks sent a clear message to the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">It matters not so much whether this is done one year earlier or later; what matters is that the Commission should make it clear that those who have not got it fixed by a given date, those who have not fitted these new journey recorders into new vehicles, will have problems in their own country and problems with their business operations. I take it as read that you too will do the work you have announced and say that there will be no more indulgence.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be not only a pity but would also send the wrong message if the countries that have done what needs to be done were to end up indirectly penalising their businesses as a result of the countries that have failed to do so getting away with it – and we know which countries have not done their preparatory work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am much obliged to the Commissioner for, as I see it, sending a clear signal that our primary concern, where driving times and rest periods are concerned, is with safety followed in second place by unfair competition. It is because of these two dimensions that the whole transport sector is united in backing initiatives of this kind, for it is not acceptable that, tomorrow, it should be those, in this industry, who do not abide by the law who earn the most money. With the backing of the majority, all countries will eventually take the same approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the second point I want to make, which is that we, in this House, can draft – and, indeed, adopt – the best of directives, but that is pointless if there is no willingness or desire in the Member States to monitor them in a systematic manner. I would go so far as to say that I am convinced that there are many areas in which we have no need of lots of new legislation; what we need is simplification, along with, in some cases, a certain tightening up of the scope for interpretation, so that the people in the various countries know what to expect. Even the best of directives will be futile without the possibility of monitoring and equally applied sanctions. That being so, I would also like to thank the Commission, which will take the initiative in dealing with serious misdemeanours. We will do this on a consensus basis. I would, in any case, ask that those who are not members of the PPE-DE Group should also acknowledge this result as being what I believe it to be – a step forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All these things count as progress, and that is to the credit not least of our rapporteur, Mr Markov, who, right up to the very end of the process, has endeavoured splendidly to represent this House’s views, and it is for that reason that most of my group will be voting in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that there is one serious reason why I shall not be voting in favour of the conciliation result, and that is the Council’s refusal to allow it to be coupled with the Working Time Directive. Despite many offers of compromise on the part of Parliament, the Council has not found it possible to make concessions on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">The driver’s working time does, however, include all his other duties, such as loading and unloading, repairs, filling in forms, all of which are tiring and therefore have a direct effect on safety on the road. It is for that reason that compliance with the working time directive must be monitored as well as driving and rest times checked up on. That is why it has to be possible for offences against the working time directive to be prosecuted and to incur sanctions. The Council was not able to do that, and it also owes us an explanation for that.</p>
<p class="contents">It took a week for the reason for the Council’s refusal to become clear, when it turned out that ten Member States have not, to date, transposed the Working Time Directive at all, even though the deadline for them to do so expired in March 2005. The ten Member States in question are Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. It is no wonder that the Council refused to allow it to be coupled with another piece of legislation. I wish the Commission had supplied us with this information earlier on in these proceedings, for then, I believe, the fact that this directive had not even been transposed in ten Member States might well have caused our debate on this subject to take a slightly different course.</p>
<p class="contents">Driving and resting times, working time and monitoring belong together. The Council has chosen to stand in the way of that, and that is why, today, this result gets a ‘no’ vote from me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, throughout the work on these two directives, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has been an adherent of more stringent monitoring of compliance with the rules on driving and resting times, and we welcome the digital tachograph, for there is a need for more uniform and consistent enforcement of the rules. We need this with a view to road safety, and we need it in order to ensure fair conditions of competition for those haulage contractors and drivers who observe the rules. Infringements of the legislation must be detected, and the culprits punished. We have, however, been more sceptical about significant changes to the rules themselves, where driving and resting times are concerned. It is a fact that the rules are complicated, but they are well established and they are known by the drivers. If we change them, we must change them for the better.</p>
<p class="contents">With the conciliation now arrived at between Parliament and the Council, I believe, however, that we have found a sensible balance, and we in the ALDE Group are able to support the conciliation. The rules are being simplified, which, in certain cases, also means that they are becoming less flexible. In future, it will not be possible to divide the daily resting time into several shorter rest periods. The rules will require a daily rest period divided into periods of nine and three hours. In return, however, the rules will be relaxed at other points, granting, for example, more flexible rules in connection with ferry services. What is also important is that the rules are now also to cover lorries from third countries, which do not come within the AETR agreement. It is important for lorry drivers to be fully rested, irrespective of whether they come from Denmark or Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of monitoring drivers’ working time has been important in the negotiations. The ALDE Group was opposed to the police being handed responsibility for monitoring compliance with the rules governing drivers’ working time. Such monitoring is organised very differently from one country to another, and that is something we have to accept. That does not mean that we do not want to see the Working Time Directive for drivers enforced, and I would indeed call on the Commission to monitor implementation of the Working Time Directive and ensure that all countries monitor and enforce it in a uniform manner, so that there is no distortion of competition in this area, either. Bus and coach owners will not be satisfied with the result of the conciliation. It will become more difficult to organise bus and coach journeys in the same way as at present, when drivers may make themselves available for more than six days in a row. I regret that we were unable to obtain a more flexible solution in this case. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the overall result, and I thank Mr Markov and the shadow rapporteur for their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, the legislation surrounding digital tachographs has been called a farce because it has for so long been uncertain when it would be introduced. Faced with changing announcements about the rules, haulage contractors have found themselves in a legal vacuum. I think that the farce now needs to come to an end, and I would therefore conclude by putting the following question to Commissioner Barrot: will you guarantee that when, in a year’s time, the new legislation on driving and resting times is brought into force, account will be taken of the problems involved in converting the digital tachographs from the present rules to the new ones? Are you able to guarantee that, Commissioner? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That common cause was one and the same as the original intention of the directive: to do away, in Europe, with the accidents in heavy traffic and impairments to road safety caused by drivers suddenly succumbing to cumulative driving fatigue, as well as with the scandalous social dumping in the transport industry, which results in unfair competition not only between European countries but also between them and third countries, with all those who act fairly and properly – not least towards their employees – losing out.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation process on this matter, though, it has to be said that we came up against a concrete wall – a concrete wall in the Council, which made it impossible for us to go as far as really would have been necessary and useful. The fact is that the need for checks on driving times to take into account also the other periods of time when the driver was working is actually pretty much self-evident and ought really to be blindingly obvious. If, though, this situation is to be improved overall, one thing is especially important, and it is to be found in the second part of the regulation – I refer to efficient monitoring. That is now an obligation incumbent on the Member States, who must now carry out more frequent checks, so that the sort of scandals in the haulage industry with which we used to be familiar, and the serious accidents caused by cumulative driving fatigue, will at last be consigned to the past.</p>
<p class="contents">What eventually persuade me to support the directive after all was the need for this monitoring to be tightened up, for that is indispensable. I believe that we need these rules if we are to achieve certain improvements, even if we do not yet have the coherence with the Working Time Directive that is needed. Other points of criticism include, for example, the fact that some of the rules are so complex that those who are not initiated into their mysteries cannot understand them, or the excessively lengthy times allowed for the checks to be adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">I did, however, find it a rather bitter experience to discover that, right up to the end, the Council was not willing to be persuaded of the indispensability of measures aimed at making our roads safer and dealing with social dumping. We did, nevertheless, manage to move forward, but we now have to ensure that the Member States actually do end up transposing the regulations and doing something in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In their fight to constantly improve this protection, interest groups were knocking on national legislators’ doors. These days, there is far more international freight traffic, covering hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles. This turns the differences between national regulations into a nuisance factor in the competitive struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies that get their workers to work long shifts appear to be in a strong position. In many cases, they do not take into consideration the fact that this advantage is cancelled out by accidents whereby human lives, vehicles and cargo are destroyed or lost altogether. In many cases, centralised decision-making does not benefit organisations that want to protect these jobs, the environment and safety. Above all, it strengthens the position of those who, despite public opinion, want to emphasise corporate interests, entrepreneurial freedom and unbridled economic growth. That is also evident in driving and resting times.</p>
<p class="contents">Workers can be forced to work in excess of their driving hours. Smaller lorries for express services are exempt, which means that instead of a 12-hour break, they are only entitled to an 11-hour break. Compliance is still not monitored adequately. Better legislation could have already been in place and will need to be put on the agenda once again in the near future. Serious consideration will also need to be given to the new problem of companies in some Member States not compensating their staff for compulsory resting times or reimburse them for essential expenses incurred for accommodation. In the short term, this compromise represents a minor improvement, especially since it will also apply to lorries from countries outside of the European Union, and also in view of the fact that the digital tachograph is easier to monitor. That is a reason, despite serious objections, to give a positive verdict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU will maintain nothing, so this is a scam. Lorries and coaches will pay: scam 1, a daily charge of EUR 8; plus scam 2, an annual charge of up to EUR 1 400; plus scam 3, tolls based on distance travelled; plus scam 4, an urban mark-up of 25% under the Euro-vignette; plus scam 5, an estimated EUR 1 500 to change to a digital tachograph; plus scam 6, driver-specific photo licences – in short, ID cards; and scam 7, EUR 3.5 billion paid by EU citizens because each vehicle will be tracked by Galileo, described as the biggest, whitest elephant ever to become weightless. But will this reduce congestion and emissions? Should buses and coaches be the first category to be charged? The answer is no.</p>

I do not agree with the previous speaker, because I believe that harmonising social safeguards and road safety is an important task of this Parliament and our institutions. It is a task on which I do not always agree, even though I believe that, when it comes to increasing safety in the interest of Europeans, we need to be able to reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like simply to point out that, while on the one hand the balance struck by the directive is a reasonably acceptable one, and is therefore a balance that I generally support, on the other hand there are some inflexible aspects to the directive that could perhaps have been toned down: I am referring in particular to those aspects regarding working time and rest breaks. Although I can agree on them, they could have been toned down more in terms of applying the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have further doubts – and on this point I address Mr Barrot – about the digital tachograph. I know, for instance, that in my country, Italy, we are having difficulties finding workshops capable of initialising these instruments. I wonder whether other EU countries are experiencing the same difficulties. The Italian Ministry of Production Activities has granted a derogation to the road hauliers with regard to the certification of times and speeds, precisely because the instrument is not yet enabled. If the problem exists in other countries too, then I wonder what can be done about it. If no action is taken, then we are in danger of starting a process that in the end cannot be carried through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, too, would have liked to see a connection made with the monitoring of working times, but, if you had had your way late on the evening of 6 December, we would have ended up with nothing at all. We would have had nothing to show for the two years we had spent in negotiations, and that is something we regard as unacceptable. In line with the majority opinion as expressed this morning, I am all in favour of updating, modernising and simplifying social security regulations for the benefit of all concerned, and that is why we have to bring that about. That is why I am appealing to all Members of this House to support the compromise when we vote at noon today.</p>
<p class="contents">All this can be summed up under three headings: improved road safety, better working conditions for drivers and, above all else, helping law-abiding haulage companies to be more competitive rather than sitting back and watching those that sit lighter to the law getting away scot-free with forcing their drivers to work longer hours than are permitted, simply because they are not checked up on. Let all, then, vote to endorse the result we have got, which helps everyone – most of all the people who use roads.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, though, Commissioner, two points that I would like to make. Thank goodness we have now sorted out this issue with the final date for the introduction of the digital tachograph. Following on from what Mr Romagnoli said<span class="bold">, </span>I beg you to have more serious talks with the Member States and get them to guarantee that the state infrastructure will be in place and the driver cards made available, for the present state of affairs is unacceptable; the digital tachograph was originally meant to be introduced in August 2004, and we deferred it to May of this year on the sensible grounds that that would be more practicable for industry. Now, though, it turns out that some Member States have still not got this organised, so perhaps you might consider hauling them before the courts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He obviously thought we were talking about the Eurovignette. It is very embarrassing. We know UKIP is 20 years out of date, and it shows in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, tiredness kills. If we look at the demands on drivers these days with congestion and the just-in-time culture, we realise what strain there is on drivers. That is why this measure is a very important step forward for road safety. Key to it are digital tachographs, and key to the success of that was having a much more realistic deadline than the original one. That allows us to have proper monitoring, and this is a much simpler regulation than previous ones. That has to be the key to success.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Parliament has been able to increase the number of checks, but it is all about monitoring, implementation and enforcement. We must ensure that all Member States carry out those checks and we need coordination between the enforcement authorities in all Member States. I hope the Commission will be vigorous in monitoring progress there.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States could do more than simply apply laws. There are insufficient rest areas for drivers; there are insufficient incentives for training. I compliment the work done by Scania through its Driver of the Year competition to encourage training. Working time is clearly part and parcel of this process and needs to be monitored. I am horrified to learn that ten Member States have not yet implemented that. We hope the Commission will take greater action. Let us emphasise constantly the importance of consistent implementation. It is the Commission’s job to ensure that Member States are doing their job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Jensen has said what needed to be said. The aim was to update, clarify, and, above all, simplify, the existing rules in the area of driving times and resting times, with a view to establishing fair competition among road hauliers, traffic safety and guaranteeing the social interests of the people who work in the road transport sector. Previous documents appeared to overshoot this target completely.</p>
<p class="contents">Not enough consideration was given to the fact that what really mattered was not so much the rules on driving times and resting times as their enforcement and the different ways in which they were interpreted. All credit to the rapporteur, Mr Markov. His commitment and involvement were phenomenal and I should like to thank him for that. Something which you will not hear me say often, but the fact that the agreement on which we are voting today can be seen as reasonably acceptable, even by Liberal standards, is mainly thanks to the Council’s persistence during the negotiations, and so I strongly disagree with what Mr Piecyk had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the purpose and necessity of a number of provisions in the present agreement can still be called into question. For example, the splitting up of the daily rest period into three hours and then nine strikes me as extremely restrictive. Similarly, the weekend rest rule of 45 hours every two weeks certainly does not contribute to the flexibility that is so desperately needed in road transport. It completely escapes me how such rigid provisions could in any way contribute to road safety or better working conditions. The present agreement may, then be far from perfect, but, as I said earlier, it is acceptable. At least the industry now knows where it stands. Thank God, the daily rest period remained restricted to 11 hours. The direct link with working times inspection has been removed. The shorter weekly resting times can now simply be taken in the vehicle. Very importantly, there is now finally clarity about when the digital tachograph is to be introduced. In a nutshell, the proposal is not perfect, but acceptable, and I will be giving it the thumbs up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it must be said that, despite the positive steps, the environment which prevails in European transport does not, unfortunately, allow the value of human life to be placed beyond question; in other words, for there to be consistent monitoring at all times of the application of humane working times for drivers and monitoring of the application of safety rules at the source, at the root of the matter we are debating, by which I mean at the company head offices.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Council too rejected the proposal, which would allow the Member States' controlling authorities to carry out inspections and ascertain the extent to which the working time limits laid down in the Working Time Directive are being applied and to take account of drivers' fatigue as a result of loading and unloading the vehicle and other factors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In those 20 years, legislation has acquired a status in its own right as a basis for corporate transport patterns. That is why adverse effects in the event of changes, should, where possible, be restricted. During the negotiations, a good outcome hung in the balance for a long time, but the agreement we now have is, I think, a tenable one.</p>
<p class="contents">The main elements of progress are, in my view, on the one hand, the fact that a number of elements have remained intact. I would particularly refer to the 11 hours of daily rest time and Directive 2002/15/EC that has been left out of the equation. We have also gained a definitive date for the introduction of the digital tachograph. This will remove much of the uncertainty about the use of this instrument and will hopefully help put more effective monitoring measures in place. The more stringent monitoring rules will contribute to this regulation’s effectiveness. An identical explanation and application of the rules across all the countries is essential for the internal market to work well.</p>
<p class="contents">The status quo has been improved by, among other things, the adequate powers given to the inspectors and clear agreements on criteria for inspections and reports. In general, a stricter regime will be put in place, which, by definition, means that flexibility will suffer during implementation. I am convinced, however, that the present agreements will contribute in a positive way to a healthy and stable sector; after all, all parties involved stand to benefit from them. Finally, I am indebted to all those involved, particularly the rapporteur, for their commitment and perseverance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They assume that business managers do not know how best to organise their businesses and balance customer needs with staff resources.

It is, no doubt, the most important law on the basis of which Europe’s hauliers and bus companies have to operate, and it has developed over the course of twenty years. The only thing is that it is out of date and bureaucratic; the monitoring devices are easily manipulated, and the checks are not free of discrimination. It is because Lisbon requires improved framework conditions in terms of road safety, protection at work, opportunities for competition and reduced bureaucracy that I warmly welcome the compromise that has now, at last, been put together.</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that not everyone will rejoice in it, but the fact is that there is nothing whatever about it that makes matters worse than they are under the present legal regime. We have even managed to agree on how often checks should be carried out and on a range of sanctions to be imposed. If, today, we vote to adopt that, we will be confirming that Europe really has entered the digital age. Not least the introduction of the digital tachograph makes for clarity; with effect from May 2006, it will be required to be fitted to new HGVs and buses, and vehicles without one may be taken out of service.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Member States have to do is to guarantee the smooth transition from the analogue system to the digital one. Will they achieve this ambitious target? If not, there will be great upheavals, for example when a vehicle equipped, as the regulation requires, with a digital tachograph is checked in an EU Member State where the officials have not yet been issued with the proper reading device. There will also be problems where agreements with neighbouring Member States have not yet been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we going to do about the Ukrainian lorry driver who is checked in Brussels, but has never heard of a digital tachograph? And how can we expect Europeans to be checked in Turkey? I urge you to join with me in calling for the AETR regulations to be adapted to the digital age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text submitted to us today has been around since 2001. This is therefore the outcome of a long legislative procedure that ended with a difficult and improbable conciliation procedure, such was the resistance shown by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I will vote in favour of this text, which puts in place minimum standards. It must be pointed out that these standards constitute a significant step forward given that, in certain Member States, road transport workers were driving for as many as 70 or 74 hours and that driving times will from now on be limited to 56 hours; given that this is a text relating to social convergence, which does not prevent matters from being dealt with more satisfactorily in each of the Member States; and given that this is a text that I hope is ripe for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I very much regret what Mr Jarzembowski said about Mr Piecyk. He wanted to put a very unpleasant ideological slant on the matter. I regret it because Mr Piecyk put his finger on a problem: the absence of simultaneous checks of driving time and working time. Thus, a heavy goods vehicle could be kept moving non-stop by three underpaid drivers: the first drives, the second takes his rest break on the adjacent seat in the cab and the third takes his weekly rest break on the back seat, behind the driver. That is the reality of the matter, and I believe that we have let a great social text slip by. I regret that somewhat, but I will nevertheless be voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the majority of my fellow Members, I am delighted that the European Union should have taken up the issue of the harmonisation of social legislation in the area of road transport, even if there is still a great deal to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, although the European Union has tentatively – too tentatively – instituted policies aimed at transferring the movement of freight from road transport to other modes of transport, an outcome that our fellow citizens hope and pray for, it must be said that road haulage is constantly on the increase, and this throughout the entire Community. In this context, contrary to what Mr Mote said, all of the European transit countries, with France being one of them, are particularly aware of the need not only to improve road safety and working conditions for road hauliers, but also to eliminate distortions of competition and to fight against social dumping. I would mention, by way of example, the serious difficulties that the Alsace region is encountering in terms of reducing the catastrophic effects of transit traffic by road.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the subject being dealt with today, there is an urgent need – and on this point I agree with Mr Savary – to harmonise the working conditions for road hauliers and the rules to be applied in relation to rest periods and driving times. The aim of these measures is to cut the number of road accidents caused by driver fatigue, even if there is still much to be done, and to improve the safety of everyone in Europe. Even though, on this point, the agreement concluded is still insufficient, which is undoubtedly due to the fact that we are talking here about a compromise, the Markov reports resulting from the readings in Parliament and the conciliation procedures constitute a significant step forward in terms of fighting against social dumping and of simplifying, and at the same time clarifying, the road transport sector. That is why, in the end, we will adopt this text.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I hope that the European Commission regularly carries out impact studies in order to ascertain that the measures we are taking today are not only sufficient but, also and above all, that they are applied and monitored, thanks mainly to the effective use of digital tachographs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If there is one area in which social and fiscal dumping wreaks havoc and in which it is imperative that the legislator steps in, it is road transport. With employees forced to work at a furious pace due to the just-in-time phenomenon, one can rightly talk about a wage of fear. A wage of fear that is all too often an hourly starvation wage, one that compels people to calculate driving times on the basis of distances travelled, without giving a single thought to safety or their health or that of others. I am also thinking of the small businessmen in this sector who live in daily fear of going bankrupt, victims of the criminal dogma of free and undistorted competition, who are very far removed today from the ideals that first led them to become self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one law, that of transporting a commodity from one point to another, as quickly and as cheaply as possible. The risks do not matter; after all, there is insurance. This law has a name: the law of the jungle. It is high time we acted so that our roads are no longer like the Wild West. Despite the courageous and tenacious efforts of our fellow Member, Mr Markov, I regret the timidity of the final texts. Nevertheless, they do constitute a first step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our fellow Members rant on about big-brother-style surveillance when the use of electronic techniques for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the regulation is mentioned. They call this an attack on individual freedoms. However, it is a question here of protecting lives. Cannot they see that it is the big bosses of European businesses that are the main terrorists, the ones that breach social laws and encourage fiscal and social dumping among our nations, those employers who are directly responsible, on a daily basis, for dozens of fatal accidents on our roads? So yes, let us use all the resources available to us in order to guarantee safety and to enable the European Union to live peacefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regard the new system as being very much to be welcomed – after all, it is intended, in combination with information and communications systems, to be a simple fleet management tool and to be indispensable in enforcing professional drivers driving times and rest periods. In doing that, the intention is that it should enhance road safety and prevent social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, be under no illusions about the fact that the conversion to digital will achieve its object only if what has been announced – the more frequent checks, including on the vehicle’s roadworthiness – actually happen. It is frequently the case that vehicles – those from Eastern Europe, for example – are not actually roadworthy.</p>
<p class="contents">When one considers the many and various ways in which analogue monitoring devices can be manipulated, digital technology really does seem to bring improvements in its wake, but I do believe that new ways of interfering with it will soon be found. It is indeed the case that newly-registered HGVs without working tachographs can be decommissioned after May 2006, but, in the absence of any requirement that older vehicles be upgraded, crafty hauliers will probably find a way of using this to their own benefit. The question also arises of to what extent recourse will be had to vehicles licensed in other countries or preferential treatment given to firms based in them. It is to be hoped that this will not turn out to be another example of a good idea being turned to EU businesses’ competitive disadvantage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outcome of the conciliation was, at first, unacceptable to the rapporteur, but I did, in fact, regard it as an improvement on the outcome of the vote in this House’s plenary meeting. It contains a readily workable break regulation – 11 hours instead of 12 hours of rest – and allows drivers to decide for themselves where to sleep rather than having Parliament deciding the matter for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I think the proposal is acceptable, even though it does contain elements about which I am unhappy. It is far too detailed in places, and particularly the options for coach travel spread over several days are too restrictive. I should like to ask Commissioner Barrot for his opinion on this, because this will really cause practical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We finally have certainty about when the digital tachograph will be introduced, and I am pleased to see Commissioner Barrot again taking a very firm line on this. Commissioner, you said there would be no period of grace after May 2006, and we will hold you to that, for we will not accept a situation in which those who have dutifully introduced the new digital tachograph will be monitored more strictly than lorry combinations that are not fitted with one. I therefore hope that you will really take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we need are safer and more secure roads in Europe. At present, 43 000 people die each year on our roads, and we know that whenever large vehicles are involved in accidents, the consequences are disastrous. We must do everything in order to obtain safer and more secure roads. The fact is that the decision we have to take concerns a genuinely European issue. Haulage contractors and professional drivers often operate in more than one European country. Their day-to-day work consists in moving goods and passengers across the whole of our continent. Competition is at European level, and it is at European level that we therefore also need to have fairly similar conditions of competition, as well as the ability properly to monitor compliance with the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also obtain better conditions for professional drivers, conditions that make driving safer and more secure for them. That is something about which we have the opportunity to decide today. We shall not obtain everything, but we shall make a little progress. We are also concerned here with the introduction of digital tachographs, and that, I think, is a very important issue. At present, we have tachographs that can be, and are, manipulated. It is important for us to obtain more secure tachographs that help make driving safer and more secure for us all, including those who drive for a living. I therefore propose that we vote in favour of this conciliation proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I stick by my previous words describing these proposals as impractical, untenable and unenforceable. Following the long, drawn-out conciliation process, we have before us something which is still blind to the realities of the haulage, distribution and public transport sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that this is a road safety measure. It is nothing of the sort! Bus services in rural areas – where many people are elderly and rely on public transport – will be jeopardised due to the inflexibility of this proposal. Either that, or the costs to local taxpayers will rise significantly as public authorities strive to pile on even greater subsidies, let alone the fact that UK industry tells me that it will be at least five years before there is a sufficient number of trained drivers to meet the requirements of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the commercial sector, just-in-time delivery systems – the backbone of modern industrial supply – will also be jeopardised due to the lack of drivers. All of which is not speculation, as an independent survey of over 500 haulage companies from my constituency indicates. Some haulage companies are planning to shut down altogether due to EU over-regulation. I can guarantee to every Member in this House that the negative effects will be mirrored in other Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We keep hearing the Commission state that it will be repealing over-regulatory legislation and not proceeding with other damaging proposals. Here we have another opportunity for the Commission to prove exactly that. Today gives us an opportunity to let business run itself without the heavy hand of Brussels always at its shoulder.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge that this proposal be rejected so that companies, whether in haulage or public transport, can prosper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is also an agreement that achieved the social convergence of 25 Member States and that is a very good political sign in terms of gradually removing the disturbing risk of social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand Mr Markov's frustration, however, because it has not been possible to use this legislation as a lever to make progress on working time. Nevertheless, I believe that it will be useful, and we will see that in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As in all good agreements, therefore, the particular interests of the parties have been partially frustrated for the sake of the general interest, but the truth is that significant progress has been made in the area of breaks, daily and weekly breaks and weekly hours, as well as the establishment of more and stricter controls and penalties that are trans-national. Furthermore, it obliges the Member States, and commits the Commission, to internationalising this progress in the AETR Agreement and, of course, there is no excuse to delay the introduction of tachographs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore managed to balance rigour and flexibility, harmonisation and subsidiarity; in other words, it is a miracle, though a secular one of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by supporting Mr Markov’s demands that the Commission study the impact of smaller lorries on road safety, promote cooperation amongst controlling authorities and hold seminars with social partners.</p>

<p class="contents">We will, in essence, be giving tangible form, in Community law, to the objectives of both these legal documents. Over the coming years, then, our main concern will have to be with compliance with these new standards and we will, in particular, have to concentrate on how that compliance is monitored. Although that will be a matter primarily for the Member States and their administrative structures to deal with, the Commission would be well advised to lead back to the path of virtue those offenders in certain Member States – and there will certainly be some – who neglect to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also envisages the regulation having another purpose, one that has not yet been really addressed today, but one that we should consider nonetheless, and that is that the new rules should be simplified. I am not sure whether our great gamble in this has paid off; I am already hearing the same old weeping and wailing about what a bureaucratic monster Europe is, and I know that we may well, where the future benefits of this legislation are concerned, be obliged to say nothing or far too little on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows, then, that we must ensure that the haulage firms and the drivers who work for them do not see the rules and the monitoring of them as some sort of bureaucratic harassment, and that we must, rather than allowing people to talk only about the evils of Europe, always turn the conversation round to the added value that will accrue to it through improved road safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did not perhaps completely resolve every issue, but the proposal we now have on driving and resting times is a good one. It is a good proposal that the digital tachograph be introduced to improve monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, a problem with the Working Time Directive, but that is not something we can blame on these regulations. The problem is that it is not applied widely enough, and I want to say to the Commission and the Council that the Council too must agree to the proposal we have put forward here in Parliament concerning a new Working Time Directive. Therein lies the problem. It would therefore be a mistake to vote against the proposal. Instead, we must see it as a way of bringing pressure to bear. In this Chamber, we have agreed on a constructive regulation covering drivers, and now it is time to obtain a Working Time Directive that also meets Europeans’ expectations.</p>

How many times following a tragic incident on the motorways of Europe has the accident proven to be due to human error? And how many times, in truth, has the error been made by professional lorry and bus drivers often forced to work under exhausting conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we need to give these people the possibility of having fewer hours' driving on a daily and weekly basis and longer rest periods. This will result in a reduction in road traffic accidents, especially where buses are involved in collisions, causing multiple fatalities. In my country, as elsewhere in Europe, we unfortunately have numerous such incidents, especially recently.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a very good thing for there to be harmonisation of these matters at European level, given that road transport by definition goes beyond the borders of one Member State.</p>

I would point out that, among the Member States that received a reasoned opinion, Ireland has already put its situation in order. If the other Member States do not do so, then the Commission will still have the option of bringing them before the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now provide some more specific answers. In response to Mr Markov and to Mrs Ayala, I will state that the study on the use of small lorries is under way, that we envisage a meeting taking place this year with all of the interested parties and, once again, that we are going to increase the coordination between these texts and the directive on drivers’ working time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Koch pointed out the problem of applying the legislation outside the Union’s borders. We have committed ourselves to negotiating with a view to bringing the AETR in line with our legislation. We also intend to protect the Union against social dumping and we intend also to apply the digital tachograph to AETR drivers and drivers from Russia, Turkey and the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Griesbeck pointed out the rerouting of traffic via the Alsace region. The new Eurovignette Directive, adopted by Parliament and the Council, will make it possible for the Member States to install tolls on these alternative routes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament was more open to the demands of industry; the Council was not; the Commission was open to both solutions, but the conciliation procedure went in the Council’s favour. We can, all the same, acknowledge that safety will win out here.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the use of the tachograph. Ladies and gentlemen, you will at some point hear the digital tachograph mentioned. The Commission is working with officials from the Member States to ensure that the introduction of the digital tachograph is coherent and harmonised, both on the roads and in businesses. Mr Romagnoli, I know that the Italian workshops have fallen behind, like those in some other Member States. That is a regrettable situation, and we have demonstrated our understanding. Nevertheless, the tachograph is a crucial element in terms of road safety and compliance with the regulation, and if a Member State is not ready on the date set by Parliament, in agreement with the Council, then I can tell you straight away that there will be no further delay. This is a question of coherence, and we will quite simply take infringement action.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while apologising for not answering all the questions posed, I should like to point out the many advantages of the legislative package.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President called for silence from the Members)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A clear limit on weekly driving times, the impossibility of bypassing rest breaks, a simplified daily rest period, regular weekly rest periods, a standard policy in relation to interpreting and applying the regulation, the extraterritoriality of penalties and greater accountability throughout the transport chain: these are the main breakthroughs in the regulation. As for the directive, it enables us to increase the number of checks, both on site – at the roadside in this case – and also on the premises of the businesses, where the checks will be mainly carried out. All of this should enable us to improve the checks, make them effective and guarantee greater cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the commotion accompanying my speech is only the expression of widespread approval, even if Parliament may have some regrets about not having been fully supported by the Council. In any event, I thank Parliament for its excellent work on these two texts.</p>
