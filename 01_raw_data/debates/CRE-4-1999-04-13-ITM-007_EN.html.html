<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Chanterie </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps useful to start by saying that European legislation on working time is a matter of safety and health at work, and as such it is a right to which workers are entitled. It was enshrined in a directive in 1993 and upheld in 1996 by the European Court of Justice. But a number of sectors and activities have so far not been covered by this directive, namely a number of transport sectors, sea fishing and other activities at sea, and doctors in training. We are required today to look at the legislative proposals to bring these excluded sectors within the scope of the directive. The Commission has opted for a twin‐track approach, on the one hand amending the existing horizontal directive and on the other hand putting forward three specific vertical directives for the transport sector, EU seafarers and seafarers aboard vessels entering EU ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has followed this dual approach, with Mr McMahon"s report on sectoral legislation and my own report on adaptation of the existing directive. Broadly speaking, the committee favours bringing all the excluded sectors and activities within the scope of the directive. That will require, amongst other things, a revision of Article 17 on derogations so that better account can be taken of the specific features of each of these sectors and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I stand by my original proposal that the exclusion of seafarers should be reversed. Like transport workers, seafarers can make use of the derogations provided for in the directive. And maritime transport, like road transport, can have recourse to a separate directive. There is in any case a European agreement between shipowners and unions. So why exclude them further? That is not defensible in either legal or political terms. One may even wonder if it is still defensible to single out another occupational group, the armed forces in peacetime. I think, Commissioner, that we need answers to these questions when the directive is revised in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of debate was Sunday as a day of rest. The 1993 directive provided for this, but the 1996 judgment of the Court of Justice declared it invalid. It is not Sunday as a day of rest as such which is being abandoned, but Sunday rest as an element of worker health and safety protection. So Sunday as a day of rest ought not really to be abandoned. What we need is a different legal basis to justify Sunday as a day of rest. The European Parliament adopted a position on this in its resolution of 12 December 1996. That resolution calls on the Member States and the social partners too to acknowledge the special character of Sunday as a day of rest.</p>
<p class="contents">You backed that resolution, Commissioner, and you also confirmed it in a letter to me dated 8 January 1999. In seeking a solution, I would point to the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and in particular Article 151(4), which together with Article 128(1) of the Maastricht Treaty provides a suitable legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words now on doctors in training. I think one of the most important merits of this legislation we are now enacting is that it brings to an end the inhuman working conditions, and various abuses, which a junior doctor has to endure. It is most important to patients too, since it has often become apparent that junior doctors who have been on duty or gone without sleep for 60, 70 or 80 hours on the trot are often not best placed to make the right judgements when emergency intervention is required.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission"s suggestion is to allow a temporary exemption, making the limit not 48 but 54 hours, for a period of seven years. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs arrived at a compromise, to accept the extension from 48 to 54 hours but for just four years, not seven.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the United Kingdom would like to go further than that, with a derogation for 15 years, but that takes us well into the 21st century, and I think we might ask whether members of the British Government would be happy to be treated in those conditions or not. They might prefer to go to a different hospital. In other words, we have to discuss and vote on all these things today and tomorrow. I believe that this, together with the Ghilardotti report, is one of the most significant pieces of social legislation we shall have produced by the end of this parliamentary term.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on bringing forward legislation for the excluded sector. We have in front of us today a comprehensive package of proposals to protect about five million workers in road, rail and sea transport, as well as junior hospital doctors in training and offshore oil workers who are not covered under the original working time directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate today is the first step in this Parliament, following the new Amsterdam Treaty, to ensure that minimum standards of working time are established for all workers throughout Europe. This is not an easy task. To match minimum health and safety standards and at the same time to have some operational flexibility, which may be necessary in certain circumstances given the nature of these sectors, is not going to be easy. We can be encouraged by the fact that the social partners reached an agreement in the rail industry and in maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the seafarers agreement, given that it was a European social model, which formed the basis of our own wider agreement in the ILO Convention 180. Unfortunately, when we come to the road sector, the social partners were unable to reach an agreement. But they held important negotiations and they have learned valuable lessons.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting my report, which deals with the various transport sectors, my paramount concern has been the need to protect workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety of working excessively long hours. The report is also about ensuring safe and competitive transport systems in the interests of the general public. If we fail to deal with the regulation of working time in the transport sector, we run the risk not only of endangering the health and safety of the workers but at the same time of distorting competition within the internal market. This is particularly true in the road transport sector, where 78 % of transport companies are small businesses operating with less than five vehicles. It therefore makes sense to adopt European‐wide rules on working time, which will operate alongside a tachograph and will ensure a level playing‐field in road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support, therefore, the Commission's proposal to extend the working time rules to all mobile workers in road transport, including self‐employed drivers. These rules would protect road haulage workers, who are subcontracted out and end up becoming self‐employed without any choice and without any health and safety protection. Not only will the Commission's legislation protect workers in the transport industry but it will improve road safety in the interests of road users and passenger safety. Up to 45 000 people are killed each year on the roads within the European Union and 18 % of all these fatal accidents involve either trucks or coaches, often as a result of driver fatigue. Only by providing adequate rest breaks, restrictions on hours and working patterns for mobile workers can safety be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">I have consistently argued in this report that too many derogations to the maximum working week, to rest periods or night work for mobile workers, would endanger health and safety standards. I am inclined to argue that the possibility to derogate from the 48‐hour working week up to a maximum of 60 hours is, in itself, a substantial derogation and that no further derogations beyond that should be allowed. However, following a compromise we reached in committee, I have agreed that derogations can exist for weekly working time and rest periods, provided that this is negotiated and agreed by the social partners and the workers are offered compensatory rest.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to address the situation of taxi drivers under these proposals. I fully support the Commission's proposal that taxi drivers should come under the scope of this proposed legislation in the interests of health and safety and fair competition. The Commission has been rather unfairly attacked on this. I do not believe that by introducing special categories of workers, we can fulfil our aims of providing basic level protection for all workers in the transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning very briefly to Mr Chanterie's report I would like to congratulate him on his work and thank him for the discussions that we have had. I am particularly concerned about two areas. One is the offshore oil industry, which he has touched upon, where there are traditionally very hazardous hours for health and safety – we saw what happened with Piper Alpha. Some arguments have been put forward for the oil industry to annualise working time. Obviously this will have to be as a result of negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of share‐fishermen. I welcome a clearer definition of what is a share‐fisherman. I look forward to the Commission's proposals for a forthcoming directive on the whole issue of working time and fishermen. This is another area where there are very serious dangers and risks.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Simpson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. ‐</span> Mr President, I should like to say at the outset how happy I am to be speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on this report as it is the transport sector that this legislation will have the greatest impact upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1993 the working time directive excluded some six million workers. Over 80 % of these were in transport jobs. We said at the time that in particular the exclusion of these non‐mobile workers was unfair and illogical. We are pleased now that this anomaly will be put right with this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always appreciated the problems that existed within the various mobile sectors, but it has always been a priority for the Transport Committee to ensure that a way forward is found to eventually bring them under the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted, on the whole, that the social partners, working with the Commission, have managed to come up with proposals that will put an end to excessively long hours that are dangerous to the health and safety of the workers themselves and to the travelling public as a whole. As far as the Transport Committee is concerned, our bottom line is safety. Safety has always been our guiding principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In the rail and maritime sector, agreement was reached. We welcome those agreements. Unfortunately in the road sector there was no agreement between the social partners. We congratulate the Commission on taking an initiative to bring forward legislative proposals. I would also welcome here the trade unions' readiness to negotiate on working time for flight crews in civil aviation, within the joint civil aviation authority. I really hope that an agreement can be reached there.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is very dear to our hearts. It is the implementation and the monitoring of the legislation that now becomes important. It is all very well having good legislation, but making sure that it is adhered to is key. We want to see proper controls and all sections of public transport involved and included.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Transport Committee I would like to thank Mr McMahon for his cooperation and say that this has been a very good example of cross‐committee joint work on legislation that will make a very great deal of difference to the health and safety of our citizens.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Velzen, Wim </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, my group is naturally delighted that we are able today to look at two reports which in effect deal with cornerstones of social policy. It is remarkable too that all this is possible in the final months of the term of office of Messrs Chanterie, McMahon, van Velzen and Flynn. In my opinion, they will be sorely missed in future. But what pleases us most is that we now have an end to the situation in which whole sectors are arbitrarily excluded altogether from normal directives, whereby it is claimed that workers in those sectors are so special that they can be expected to work extremely long hours and with particularly short or ridiculous rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">I do accept that there are sectors in which exceptional circumstances obtain. We said to begin with that these were so special that they had to be excluded, but now we are saying that they must in principle be included and that if an exemption is granted, it can be granted only on the basis of an agreement between the social partners in the sector concerned. And that sits very well with Fiorella Ghilardotti"s report. We have had people lobbying us, because take it from me, a great many lobbyists have been very busy. People have lobbied us saying that this will not work, because they do not have a social dialogue. We see the requirement that an agreement can only be accepted if it is based on social dialogue as a kind of incentive for people in those particular Member States to revive the social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think that after this debate we ought to have a further discussion, involving amongst others the Socialists and Christian Democrats, because there are a number of amendments which I think are very risky, in that grey area between self‐employed and employed taxi drivers, for example. I am particularly afraid that there may be no parallelism between the circumstances of employers and employees, so that employees are forced into ‘sham" self‐employment. I would like a little more debate on that, because to my mind some of the PPE Group"s amendments present a dangerous opening.</p>

This is a difficult subject and they have both done a fine job. So thank you very much, Mr Chanterie and Mr McMahon!</p>
<p class="contents">I can only agree with Mr van Velzen. We cannot exclude sectors from legislation of this kind just because they are problematic. One reason for this is the health of the workers. When I consider the demanding jobs done by mobile workers and self‐employed drivers, I cannot see any difference between employees and self‐employed drivers in terms of danger to health. I believe that protection needs to be provided for both groups. Of course this also applies to seafarers on board ships, offshore workers and in particular doctors, who certainly do not have an easy job. That is one reason, the workers" health. The other is of course safety, and unfortunately this also affects those who do not work in these sectors. You see, if an overtired lorry driver runs into my car, although I am driving properly, that is certainly not exactly good for me. If a ship carrying oil – and this is something we have experienced – runs aground because the master is asleep, this puts the whole environment at risk. It is therefore very easy to see the wider implications of the safety issue. I think that for this reason alone, this is very, very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Velzen, I think that we should actually make renewed efforts within the two large groups – and perhaps with all the others who are willing to cooperate – to reach compromises on the amendments. I would see this as particularly important in these two areas. I also hope that we find a reasonable solution to the Sunday rest issue, one which the Commission is also able to endorse, without the European Court of Justice raising difficulties once again.</p>

The occupational groups concerned have in recent years asked us on many occasions, as Members of the European Parliament, to bring about a solution to their situation. I am thinking for example of aircrews, seafarers and doctors too, as mentioned by Mr Chanterie. My group will be supporting an overwhelming majority of the proposals and also some of the amendments. Our main concern here will be on the one hand the safety and protection of the personnel in question, but on the other hand the safety of society, which is also a factor here. Some speakers have already referred to this. From that point of view, I have also argued in my group that you cannot make a distinction between the self‐employed – people who work for themselves – and the rest, because if he is overtired, a payroll employee is no less of a danger than a self‐employed person. In virtually all the sectors we are dealing with here, there are two sides to the coin: not only the safety of the personnel in question, because otherwise you could say that employers should look after safety themselves, but also the safety of the rest of society, because there are always going to be sectors in which damage can be caused to the rest of society. So for us that is good reason to have the same legislation applying to both categories of people and to support that element.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a brief remark on the subject of doctors in the United Kingdom. I find it bizarre that the United Kingdom continues to squabble over this, and given that we have so many UK Socialists in the House, I should like to ask whether, now that the colour of the government has paled somewhat, its position might not change?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moreau </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, firstly I must underline the importance of the working time issue for the excluded sectors, in particular road transport, as this involves both social justice and road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the dramatic accident in the Mont Blanc tunnel which has plunged both France and Italy into mourning, we need more than ever to develop sustainable means of transport, offering maximum safety guarantees and fully respecting the environment. These means include rail, inland waterway and sea transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone here agrees on this need which must be translated into acts containing provisions to improve road safety in particular. This would specifically involve combating the social dumping practised by the road transport sector whereby drivers have to work shocking hours under conditions which are outrageous in the present day. This should be the main aim of the reports presented today.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of self‐employed drivers and a better definition of working time are steps in the right direction, as also is the assertion by Mr Chanterie of the importance of Sunday rest. But that is not all that is needed. Accepting a 48‐hour working week when 35 hours is being considered in many countries is a major departure and we must not go beyond this. Allowing the possibility of a working week of 60 hours, provided that the average of 48 hours is respected over a four‐month reference period, constitutes a blank cheque for all kinds of abuse. Remember that accidents increase after 55 hours" work.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of night work, the two‐month reference period is also too long. For effective control, the reference period should not exceed one month for day work and one week for night work. The trade unions are firm in their demands for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My amendments specify these requirements and they also demand a break after four and a half hours" work. Why not when the highway code recommends that car drivers should take a break every two hours?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must mention something which is purely linguistic. It concerns the translation into French of the term ‘standby". This is given in the report as ‘<span class="italic">période d"attente</span> ". I propose that this should be replaced by ‘<span class="italic">période de grande interruption</span> " which corresponds more accurately to the spirit of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we are dealing here with an issue which is of great significance. We must firmly establish the objective of a labour‐oriented Europe which can really improve the situation of the employees concerned.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their work and also the draftsmen from the various committees for their assistance on what is a very difficult area to legislate on. While I welcome the general commitment towards ensuring the health and safety of workers and also guaranteeing that there is cohesion across the Member States with regard to the minimum protection that will be available, I fear for certain sectors. In particular, when we mention imposing similar restrictions on self‐employed people we are in danger of becoming too much of a nanny state where we try to control everything and regulate what everyone does. Allowance should be made for the self‐employed running their own businesses, who should not be confined in the same way as other people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, be that as it may, the matter of transport in particular impacts very much on the general public. Because of the dangers which are present because of lack of proper controls and rest periods for people involved in the transport sector, it is essential that we have common regulation across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The only criticism I have of that section of the reports is that I do not feel there is enough flexibility built in to ensure that the so‐called standby or waiting period is taken into consideration. Having read the report and the amendments I am still not fully convinced that the distinction is clear enough between the standby duties and the waiting time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the question of junior doctors in training, it was unfortunate that when the original working time directive was proposed by the Commission, this sector was excluded. Junior doctors play a critical role in patient care. There are instances where junior doctors in training are working 120 hours a week. Some of them are working straight shifts of 36 and 37 hours without any rest period or sleep. It is impossible for any human being to perform properly under those circumstances but, more importantly, it is more difficult for a doctor to make proper clinical judgments with regard to the treatment of patients while working under those conditions. So I welcome the proposals put forward by Mr Chanterie to try to bring some regulation and flexibility into that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner himself. It may be the last opportunity I have to do this in this House. When he started off in this job many years ago, he came forward with many legislative proposals which many people in this Parliament said were pie in the sky and would never be achieved. I hope this Parliament, the media and the public will recognise his tremendous record in not only completing his legislative programme but bringing Parliament along in support when people said it could not be done.</p>

It is true that in a complex situation, we need rules which vary slightly and which are adaptable. But at the same time, we need clear minimum standards which ensure that the quality of the work, the safety of third parties and also the safety of the employees themselves are not at risk. I do not think that there should be room for any flexibility here, and nor do I see how anyone, regardless of the type of contract they have – whether they are a franchise‐holder or an independent trader or whatever – can suddenly be exempted from these minimum requirements, which concern their own and other people"s safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I must also welcome the compromise reached here, because it is a first step towards bringing these sectors – whose exclusion, when we have an internal market and when these very activities are expanding, was unjustified from the outset – back into a system of statutory regulation. They are complex, and therefore need rules which vary slightly. In this context, we need to give much more recognition to the role played by the social partners in terms of implementation, and I think that experience shows that all those who are involved in the practicalities of implementing rules of this kind on the ground – which means experts, which means the two sides of industry, as the British call them – should be given a tangible role in the implementation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, this is what has happened. In this respect, I think that the two reports are on the right track. I have one further comment on Sunday rest: I do not see why it should not be possible – in our modern flexible world of production – for us to agree on a time of rest. That too is an important part of social cohesion and communication and ought to be attainable.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hudghton </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Mr President, the main principles underlying the directive on working time are important and are indeed worthy of this Parliament's support. The stated objectives are fairness to all workers in their conditions of employment, as well as recognising issues of health and safety that are able to be addressed by at least some of the Commission's proposals and some of the rapporteur's opinions. However, measures designed to achieve desirable objectives, I would contend, must be practical and be capable of recognising the special nature of certain sectors and the unique working conditions and practices therein.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent, for example, offshore workers in two very different industries: in fishing and in oil. On the one hand share‐fishermen, who work for themselves, resent the possible imposition of yet more restrictions on their working practices. Yet, on the other hand, I know from many letters from constituents on this subject that hundreds of offshore workers in the North Sea oil and gas industry would welcome being brought under the working time directive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am concerned that, as things stand, its implementation may not have much direct and positive impact on those it is really designed to target. For example, I am concerned that many offshore contract labourers would still not be entitled to paid annual leave because of the shift rotas which they work. It would be an irony if the working time directive was imposed upon fishermen who do not need or want it but fails to benefit oil workers who do.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that our policy is flexible enough to target the real problems. We must ensure that our proposals are workable and acceptable to those most directly affected by them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that Mrs Bonino's officials are exploring possible ways of taking account of the special needs of the fishing industry. I certainly hope that a satisfactory solution to that will be found with the support, I hope, of Mr Flynn. Here in Parliament we have a chance to show that we are responsive to the real needs of sectors such as offshore workers and to prove that we are not a remote and inflexible bureaucracy.</p>

We know from the background to the process of adopting that directive that it met with considerable resistance in the Council. This change is intended to bring the sectors which were excluded – some of them without good reason – within the scope of the directive. Of course, like previous speakers, I am concerned about protecting the health and safety of both employees and the others who are affected. At the same time, this begs the question of whether having extended and all‐embracing rules at European level is compatible with the principle of subsidiarity. This week we shall also be discussing the need to modernise the organisation of work. Working time is an essential part of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from statistics how much working time varies across our European countries, and that it is dependent on factors such as production technology and particular cultural features. European legislation applying to all sectors and to the whole of Europe should not stand in the way of these traditions. I also have a comment on Sunday rest: in my opinion, Sunday rest is particularly important in today"s restless world, especially for family life, social occasions, keeping up traditions and for clubs and organisations.</p>

There are many objectives behind the regulation of working time, and recently a lot has been said about the effect on employment of reduced working time. The subject is also linked to the idea of promoting health and safety, as has been mentioned here, and in many Member States we have seen that it is this area that has been affected most by experiments in reducing working time, in spite of the fact that the purpose was often to increase employment. The need to promote workers" mental and physical capacity for work through the regulation of working time still exists. Seen from this viewpoint too, Mr McMahon is largely right to support the Commission"s directives, as he does in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are good reasons for extending the health and safety protection accorded to employees to include self‐employed drivers, not just for the sake of the drivers in question, but for the sake of the other drivers on the road. I myself dozed off at the wheel of a lorry in Finnish Lapland. Finland is the size of Germany and is Europe"s most sparsely populated country, and a long road, a tired driver, and the fact that it was dark was a disastrous combination as far as I was concerned. Conditions are different among the Member States of the Union, and we also need to take account of the problem of night work. In Finland, for example, which is a big country, good, efficient services depend on a long‐distance transport network. I therefore propose a qualification, but otherwise I am happy to endorse the report.</p>

The working time directive is one of the most complex, but also one of the most important directives in the area of safety and health. Nothing is more of a factor in stress and poor performance than excessively long hours of work. The 1993 directive on the organisation of working time was therefore a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Government got nowhere when it claimed that working time was not a health and safety issue. That position was rejected by both the Court and the Council. What was strange was that so many sectors were taken out of the scope of the 1993 directive. We in Parliament accepted that, but we did insist that equivalent systems should be introduced in the sectors that were excluded. In some sectors, the social partners have concluded agreements. These we can accept and transpose into legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In a number of other sectors, the Commission has had to resolve impasses, for example over doctors in training. Problems arose over these, to which satisfactory solutions have been found in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Two problems still remain. One concerns off‐shore operations, and the other Sunday working, which was mentioned in the old directive. The Court has declared the sentence on Sunday working in the current text to be inapplicable. The sentence read as follows: ‘The (minimum) rest period referred to in the first subparagraph shall in principle include Sunday". This sentence relates to the principle that it is possible to limit Sunday working. That is an important value in our in some respects totally unregulated society. The Commission is totally ignoring this. It wants quite simply to delete the sentence, although the Court judgment does not inherently indicate that this is necessary. The Commission would do well to reconsider. This is a very important question of principle which has to be resolved in the light of the Amsterdam Treaty. We do not want to discard the article but reshape it. Consequently, we are not in favour of Article 1(b) of the Commission"s proposal and will request a separate vote on it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist (ELDR).</span>  – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, this working time directive concerns employees' working conditions, which is an important issue. A directive of this type should be based on agreements between the social partners as to what constitute reasonable working conditions, both for employees and firms. If it is to be applied in the right way, it is vital that it should have strong support from the social partners. With particular reference to my own country, Sweden, we make a point of ensuring that such support exists, so that rules of this kind have some meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also concerns other important issues, namely protection of workers' health and safety, as well as of the surrounding environment; it is important to ensure that transport does not endanger either people or the environment. In this respect, the directive is of value. Its scope has now been extended to cover a further five to six million people, which means that it is even more important to ensure that the rules are both practical and constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">There are one or two points that I should like to emphasise. Firstly, that it really is a question of minimum standards. Every Member State should therefore have the right to draw up tougher rules in the interests of both the environment and safety: that much is crucial. Secondly, regulation should be on the conservative side, rather than too detailed. Instead, those with practical experience should be allowed to interpret the minor details, in order to avoid being hemmed in by petty restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these few comments, I would in general support the proposal. In my view, it is a step along the road to a safer and healthier Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">I will confine my remarks to the fishing and maritime sector. The fishing industry in my country and in Europe generally is not like any other commercial and economic activity. It is a peculiar industry with its own special characteristics and needs and European legislation should be tailored at national level to suit the unique circumstances. I have represented the fishing industry's interests in Ireland, both at local and national level, for many years and at European level for the past five years.</p>
<p class="contents">While I support the broad thrust of the working time directive for many sectors of social and economic life, I believe that more specific legislation is needed so as to guarantee the exemption of the fishing industry from the demands of this working time directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that the specific derogation for share‐fishermen's needs to be adequately defined. I agree with this proposition, but the European Union must at all times take cognisance of the special nature of the industry and of fishing villages throughout the length and breadth of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in the maritime sector also include the European Commission's recommendation on the ratification of the ILO Convention on seafarers' hours of work and the manning of ships. The agreement reached between the social partners largely reflects the content of the Convention with regard to the minimum hours of rest, as well as introducing new provisions on health assessments and annual leave.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the verification of working hours, the European Commission has annexed a model format regarding hours of work and rest for seafarers and has suggested that the Member States should harmonise their legislation in this manner. Any changes which are going to be brought about in this regard can only be done in agreement with the fishing industry in Ireland and in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I wish to congratulate Commissioner Flynn on his persistence in having the original directive accepted despite the many obstacles at Member State level. I would now ask him to begin to consider Parliament's view, the Committee on Fisheries' view, in relation to the unique circumstances of the fishing industry.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sainjon </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Directive 93/104/EC establishing the general rules on working time excluded several sectors including the transport sector. In this sector, the rights of employees are more often than not disregarded. It was under pressure from Parliament and also to plug this gap that the Commission adopted a White Paper on excluded sectors and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion on this report, the Committee on Transport and Tourism advocated extending the directive to non‐mobile workers and including other aspects such as annual leave and rest periods for mobile workers. The reference period for these workers is quite naturally the whole year and I do believe that our discussions must remain within this framework. This is because this is a very specific sector which carries serious risks in terms of both working conditions and health and safety. For this reason, I believe that talking about annualising working time should not be regarded as outrageous, as long as this provides a clearer view of the real situation in this profession and provided that we can perhaps tackle its shortcomings more effectively. Working time could be reduced by taking the average weekly working time, calculated over the year, and prohibiting anything over 48 hours per week.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on a more general level, by this I mean taking into account mobile and non‐mobile workers, the basic question is as follows: has the directive changed the life and work organisation of European employees? Clearly the current answer is no. Once again we have a fairly vague framework which does not define strict enough limits. As a result, our labour‐oriented Europe solely consists of a minimum framework and although harmonisation favours a limited number of European citizens, it represents a backward step for the majority. While Europe as a force for labour remains restricted by this framework, it will never become sufficiently visible to the public, just like the monetary side of Europe today.</p>

It is overdue because the road transport market in the Community was fully deregulated over a year ago and the social dumping which was already very apparent in this sector is simply increasing. It is inadequate because it does not provide any significant progress overall in terms of either public safety or the working conditions of employees or self‐employed workers in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure of 48 hours proposed as the maximum working week is more than what was specified in Regulation 3820/85 establishing the organisation of road transport. In order to be consistent with this regulation we would have to consider a maximum working week of 46 hours. Yet it is clear that this figure of 46 hours is well in excess of the target of 35 hours and is by no means a massive reduction in working time, which seems to be one of the main areas of progress to be prepared and achieved in this century; this will also leave gaps in terms of public safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Even worse are the exceptions, or rather the exception, provided for by the directive and involving the maximum working week of 60 hours. You can imagine the effect that this will have on public safety and the living conditions of drivers. This exception is not acceptable. However, in order to improve the directive, even though we condemn the principle behind this exception, I would ask you to support Mrs Moreau"s proposals. She believes that this time should be less than 60 hours – I would remind you that the authorised driving time is 56 hours – and in particular that this should be calculated over a period limited to 28 days. This corresponds to the time which can be monitored and appears more reasonable than a period of four months during which abuses will be easy to perpetrate.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this directive is inadequate despite the small hesitant steps which I must welcome, specifically the similar treatment of self‐employed workers and employees. Although this is a start, it largely does not match the hopes of this Parliament and of employees in this sector.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Grosch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have not always been able to take it for granted that Parliament and the Commission would regard rules on working time as part of protecting health and safety in all sectors. Thanks to the two reports we are debating today, this does at least seem to be clear now. I should therefore like to thank both the Commission and the two rapporteurs for their work, and in addition express my hope that the same opinion will prevail in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking here on behalf of the PPE members of the Committee on Transport when I say that it is good that road transport – a sector with over five million employees – is not going to be excluded any longer; in my view, it is simply obvious that this should be the case. In road transport in particular, there is a direct correlation between working time and the numbers of accidents. I should like to stress once again how important it is for this to be implemented quickly, but also for compliance with all the measures to be enforced in all the Member States. Even though there is strong competition in the transport sector, it should not come at the expense of health or public safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The two directives are being dealt with and adopted in parallel. This shows that we intend to be consistent. It seems to me that it is important – as the rapporteurs also emphasise – for these directives to establish minimum requirements, and thus for certain countries which might have stricter criteria on safety not to interpret the directives as a licence to dismantle them. Although these directives certainly resolve the working time problem to a large extent, let me nevertheless draw your attention to a particular problem, that of local transport. Local transport covers the carriage of passengers by both road and rail. To my mind, given that many countries already have appropriate rules in this sector, the derogation in Article 7 of Directive 98/319 ought to be maintained, or this sector should quite simply be incorporated into the 1993 directive. I believe that this is what both the Commission and the employees and employers in this sector would wish to see.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and in particular Mr McMahon, to whose report my remarks are particularly addressed. I welcome the attempt to provide greater regulation and I regret that agreement could not be found with the social partners on road transport. However, I think there is a problem with the Commission proposals to which the rapporteur pays insufficient attention. That is that coach and bus drivers are effectively being categorised as road hauliers though they carry out very different tasks, requiring very different working hours. This leads to problems in two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is safety. These proposals are designed to ensure a high level of social protection for workers as well as a high degree of safety for passengers. No one would disagree with that. But the Commission statistics are slightly misleading. They tell us that 18 % of fatal accidents involve trucks or coaches and yet buses and coaches are actually one of the safer forms of road transport. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, only 2.2 % of fatal road accidents involve buses or coaches. It seems to me that the extra costs that these proposals will put on small businesses – in particular small coach companies – will lead to reduction of investment in safer and newer vehicles, which will hit the industry and perhaps undermine passenger safety.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns service. I am sure that Mr McMahon, like myself, regrets the destruction of the UK railways by the Conservative Governments and the way in which the road industry therefore developed. But the fact is that in rural areas, such as the one I represent, bus services are becoming increasingly rare. People rely on buses and coaches and the extra costs and lack of flexibility in using existing staff which these proposals would bring will have a knock‐on effect which will lead to cutbacks in services.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I propose that we ought to be looking at classifying road passenger transport with rail transport for the purposes of such regulation. This would allow services to be enhanced with no cost in terms of passenger safety.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jackson </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, earlier today Mrs Green, the Socialist Group leader, said that our agenda is for jobs – really? If that is true, then we wait to see the Socialist vote against these two reports because these proposals would cost jobs. My own group has put down some very helpful amendments to them, but, as amended by our rapporteurs, these show old‐style, old‐Labour, Euro‐social‐engineering at its worst: inflexible, authoritarian and unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows that the sectors originally excluded from the working time directive were left out because of the difficulty of including the workers they cover. Nevertheless, the Commission has put the proposals forward. In my view, Parliament's contribution might have been to try to help find a way of combining protection of workers with a flexibility that enables Europe to retain its competitiveness. The contribution of our two rapporteurs is to make things worse. Mr Chanterie confirms that he wants to include share‐fishermen in the working time directive, cutting their working week, their ability to work as they wish and ultimately cutting their opportunity of making a likelihood. What sort of message is that to the fishermen in the south‐west of England who are having a hard time making any living at the moment?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McMahon hammers the taxi drivers of Europe by insisting in his amendment that the 48‐hour week they are compelled to work within must include standby time, that is, time when they are not earning anything. He also insists that all self‐employed drivers must have a tachograph.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McMahon and Mr Chanterie should listen to the words of a taxi driver – Mrs Wendy Smith – who has written to me from Sidmouth in Devon. She says: this directive would destroy private hire completely and I am afraid no‐one is going to work under these conditions; there is a lot to consider before destroying the taxi service, but perhaps they are only interested in dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">How embarrassing it must be for Britain's Labour Government to read the McMahon report! We have asked in vain what the British Government thinks about it. Here, at last, they are faced with the consequences of Mr Blair's handiwork in signing up to European social policy and whatever he may say, such laws will be adopted by qualified majority. Get out of that Mr Blair! I urge colleagues to vote against these damaging reports.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on two excellent reports. The Commission and Parliament have been working together for over six years now to ensure that workers currently excluded from the working time directive have appropriate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with Mr Chanterie's report. There is complete agreement between the rapporteur and the Commission on the objectives to be achieved. There are, however, a considerable number of amendments which have been tabled by the rapporteurs and other Members. Most of these are acceptable to the Commission. They are Amendments Nos 1 to 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16. In particular, I welcome Amendment No 11, which provides a useful definition of share‐fishermen. I also welcome the support from the rapporteur for the Commission's proposal in respect of the annual leave as far as share‐fishermen are concerned. I have much sympathy with the arguments put forward in favour of most of the other amendments but none of them represent a fundamental opposition to the Commission's approach but rather a difference of emphasis in certain ways.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree, for example, that no sector or activity should be excluded from Community legislation on working time. The only difference between the Commission and the rapporteur in relation to seafarers is the way in which this is to be achieved. The Commission proposed, at the express wish of the social partners in the maritime sector, that only the directive implementing the agreement between the social partners should apply to the workers concerned, but only these workers are excluded from the general directive. There can be no gaps here.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Sunday rest, the situation is rather different. The provision in the working time directive that the weekly rest period should in principle include Sunday was deleted by the European Court of Justice. The Commission's proposal merely recognises that, it does not seek to alter it. I know that the rapporteur would like to reinsert that provision, and I understand his reasons for doing so. However, whatever the merits of the case, I suggest that this is not the time to do it. The sole purpose of this proposal is to protect workers in the sectors and activities currently excluded and it has taken over five years to get this far.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to open up the debate on other issues as we would then lose sight of our prime objective. I cannot, therefore, accept this part of Amendment No 9.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial area is the issue of doctors in training. Here the Commission proposed a transitional period of seven years for the application of the maximum of 48 hours on average, under certain conditions. In the Council a number of Member States are seeking longer limits on the basis of the time needed to provide basic university education to sufficient numbers of would‐be doctors.</p>
<p class="contents">While I would dearly love to support Parliament's Amendment No 15 on this point, I believe that the Commission's proposal is more realistic. While the health of doctors and patients is paramount, we must take into account the effect of a radical change on the provision of health‐care services.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue in this report concerns the annual limit on working time. Again I can understand the amendment proposed but our proposal seeks to establish minimum provisions which can be applied right across the board. In certain circumstances, in particular in the sea‐fishing and transport industries, the calculation of the limit on an annual basis is justified and Amendments Nos 17 and 20 are too restrictive, while Amendment No 18 does not really add value to the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 19, which seeks to expand the definition of mobile workers to include rail workers, is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to Mr McMahon, our other rapporteur. I should like to mention first of all the maritime proposals. I am very pleased that the rapporteur accepts the Commission's proposals, subject to the two directives being implemented simultaneously, with the ratification of ILO Convention 180 and the Protocol of Convention 147. This is entirely consistent with the Commission's approach.</p>
<p class="contents">On road transport, I welcome the broad support in the report for the initiative on working time in this sector and, in particular, for the inclusion of the self‐employed. Clearly this is not just a health and safety issue for road‐transport workers, it is also a matter of public safety, as Mr Crowley said. In addition, there is an obvious need to combat distortions in competition in a highly competitive sector, which Mr McMahon referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to say that the Commission can accept those amendments which clarify the text. They are Amendments Nos 4 to 7, 11, 14 and 15 and the first half of Nos 1 and 16 and the second half of No 8. The Commission accepts in principle the need to insert a definition of a self‐employed driver, as proposed in Amendment No 10, but intends to cover a wider scope in its definition.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain the integrity of our proposal, we must reject Amendment No 25, which seeks to exclude urban passenger transport from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the derogations, we are prepared to accept part of the compromise Amendment No 12, which relates to Article 7(2) of our proposal. We have found a general lack of support for the existing proposed derogation of up to 12 months, not only in the Council but also in the industry itself. As a result, we are prepared to delete this derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are elements that the Commission cannot accept. Parliament is aware that the Commission's stance on derogation is generally to maintain a balance between flexibility in work organisation and a minimum level of social protection. It was on this very issue that the original negotiations foundered. While I appreciate the emphasis given by Parliament to collective agreements or derogations in Amendment No 12, nevertheless the Commission considers that Member States should be offered the opportunity to provide clear rules through national legislation as in the general working time directive. This amendment is therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is still convinced that, to facilitate the organisation of work in the urban transport sector in general, the derogation offered in Article 7(3) should be retained and so we cannot agree with Amendment No 13. The same argument obliges us to reject Amendments Nos 22, 24 and 27 to 30.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments which the Commission cannot accept as they fall outside the remit of the proposal, thus Amendment No 19 and the regulation of contracts between transport agencies relate to contract law. As to Amendment No 18, on establishing a common range of penalties, it is difficult to see how Member States acting individually can establish a common range while detailed prescription by the Community in this sensitive area would be inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we must reject the second half of Amendment No 16 which is over‐prescriptive. Certain other amendments would not clarify the text. Amendment No 17 adds a non‐regression clause which is already in Article 11(3) and the Commission text reflects what is set out in the general working time directive. Amendments Nos 21 and 23 would potentially cause some confusion. As the rapporteur has accepted the Commission position on the location of the maximum weekly working time provision, in Article 3, the part of our Amendment No 1 which proposes to change recital 16 should also be deleted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 20 include a clarification on emergency mobile workers and as the primary function of these workers is not road transport, the Commission considers that they come under the general working time directive and therefore we cannot accept these amendments. Amendment No 3 and the first part of amendment No 8 include standby duty within the definition of working time for the self‐employed. The Commission considers that standby duty, as defined in the proposal, is purely an aspect of an employee's duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards Amendment No 9 on night work, in recognition of the diversity of geographical locations and legislative arrangements within the Member States, the Commission considers the proportion of annual working time which determines whether workers may be classified as night workers should be left to the Member States in consultation with the social partners rather than applying a rigid 48 days. That is to say, the amendment would conflict with the general working time directive. I hope I have clarified the Commission's position on this difficult proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Parliament for the broad support it has given to the Commission proposals and for the speed with which it has dealt with them. I know that this view is shared by my colleague Mr Kinnock and that as a result the Council, under the German presidency, will be able to adopt the directive putting into effect the seafarers' agreement and to reach a common position on the other three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to Mr Hudghton that share‐fishermen are covered except for paid holidays. To Pat the Cope Gallagher I would say that the Committee on Fisheries agreed to all these matters and we are pleased to have that support. The question about the 48 hours, the reference period of one year, the holidays – unless we are dealing with share‐fishermen – the question of medical assessment and adequate rest will be defined in a further directive which has been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">My final word is to Mr Crowley. I thank you for your kind words. I would suggest to you and to the House that the social agenda has advanced quite a lot over the past number of years. That has been achieved by a lot of determination by certain individuals, the support of good people in cabinet services and the great support I received here from the European Parliament. I am grateful for your comments.</p>
