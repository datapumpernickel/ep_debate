<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing the debate on the report by Mrs Villiers, whom I want to congratulate very heartily on her report. She has managed to reconcile the different opinions across the committee, so I believe this report represents a real step forward. In particular, it is important that she managed, by achieving a very broad majority in committee, to ensure that the requirements of the small institutions – the savings banks, the cooperative banks, the small and medium-sized businesses – are also given due consideration in this important legislative project and that what is called internal rating, i.e. the internal assessment of credit risks, will be given the same status as external rating, as proposed by the Basel Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard that as major progress. I believe it is also important in terms of the public debate to make it clear that it is not the Basel Committee, a non-elected body, that will be deciding the definitive directives, but the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, by the codecision procedure. In that public debate I keep finding people referring to the Basel Committee. In fact, the European Parliament will decide on the final legislative text jointly with the Council of Ministers, and we should make people more aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">But for me the question now is the procedure that will apply. The banking sector is very keen that we decide by a fast-track procedure. I, too, believe that Parliament should play its part here and, if possible, take the final decision at first reading. However, we must create the necessary conditions to ensure that the European Parliament's rights are in no way weakened. If possible, by one means or another, we must ensure that Parliament and the Council of Ministers can reach agreement at first reading on the legislative text that is then finalised.</p>

At the actual vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we did not have a very large majority. At least, the majority of my group voted against; and after all we did ensure that the report was not adopted during the last plenary part-session, but postponed until today. But let me say quite emphatically, that has nothing to do with the actual content of the report, but only with the fact which Mr von Wogau has just touched on, namely that we were worried that if we tied our hands in regard to the further procedure, Parliament would be renouncing its rights. Obviously we cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee itself, there was consensus on the issue as such. And the rapporteur really tried, made a real effort to bring about a consensus. We want a consensus on this question. And we would be well advised to reach a very broad consensus on it here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming changes to own funds rules for credit institutions and investment firms will have a far-reaching impact on the banking sector and beyond. These provisions very much influence the practices of credit institutions in granting loans. When we see how very heavily our European economy, and especially our small and medium-sized businesses, depend on loan financing, we soon realise that this is a very large-scale economic project. The very intensive debate on external rating made that abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">At international level, the proposal from the Basel committee to classify risks mainly on the basis of the results of ratings by external institutions would lead to considerable distortions of competition. It would create especially serious competitive disadvantages for medium-sized businesses. To prevent such distortions, it is therefore most important for the institutions to have a simple, alternative means at their disposal for identifying their own funds requirements, in fact one based on the use of internal ratings.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be regarded as a success that the European position, as proposed from the outset by the Commission in its consultation paper, prevailed in Basel, so that the inclusion of internal rating procedures is now at the centre of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Since as things stand at present, it seems that both the Basel Committee and we ourselves have accepted internal ratings in principle, our primary task now is to formulate these procedures in such a way that on principle all credit institutions within the European Union can introduce internal ratings across the board. That is the only way to create equal conditions of competition. However, that also means that these institutions must be given enough time to prepare for the new rules. The most recent information seems to suggest that the new regulation, first planned to enter into force on 1 January 2003, will be postponed until 2004. That would give the institutions more time to implement the provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">So we simply have to ensure – and here I entirely agree with Mr von Wogau – that we work as closely in tandem as possible. In particular, we must ensure that there are no major differences between Basel and ourselves in relation to timescales. Otherwise the institutions concerned would just face unreasonable burdens, additional costs or competitive disadvantages. But one thing must also be made clear. Parliament cannot and will not give up its rights of codecision. So that means that if we manage to reach a decision at first reading, jointly with the Council and the moderation of the Commission, we will be happy to do so, but we will not give up our right to the codecision procedure from the outset. It is up to the Council. It is the Council that has always delayed legislative procedures in the past. It must get its act together and ensure that we can proceed rapidly. Parliament has never been responsible for the failure of such procedures. Nor would it be responsible for failure in this case. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, do get on with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Americans will be able to introduce its provisions immediately without primary legislation, unlike us, and they will be able to lend more cheaply than European banks. Moreover, Parliament has had ample time to inform itself on the issues with this welcome Villiers report on capital adequacy.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, we are having a first reading before the proposals have been tabled. Some people in this House think that it fatally undermines Parliament's powers. We disagree. Delegating powers over technical matters is essential if regulation is to keep up with the innovations in financial markets, as long as those delegated powers are subject to proper scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here to use our powers in the interests of European businesses and our constituents, and we shall not be forgiven if we fail to do so. Dogmatically insisting that Parliament should get involved with every technical judgment will simply mean that regulation will be out of date before it even starts. It takes two to three years to pass EU law but only weeks to launch a new financial services product with implications for bank capital, such as credit derivatives. I appeal to all colleagues and particularly to the Socialist Group, to re-examine their views on this matter and look at what safeguards they would like to see in primary legislation to enable the delegation of powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marchiani (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to argue with the general substance of Mrs Villiers’ report. But what we could find surprising is its very existence, and the existence of the Commission’s new initiative here.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we talking about? The issue is to do with updating the European rules on banks’ own funds, funds that are supposed to be proportionate to the nature and scale of the risks incurred by these establishments. The report refers to a growing consensus that the present framework fails adequately to capture the changes in the financial sector over the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the phrase “growing consensus” – I am quoting from the report – in fact implies that there is no consensus on the subject as yet, we are justified in asking whether the institution promoting this reform, the chosen instrument and the chosen time are really appropriate. One cannot help feeling that Parliament, following the Commission, feels obliged to align its activities with those of the Basel committee, which, let me remind you, has no legitimate right to impose its views on the Member States. Let me also remind you that only eight Member States are represented on that committee, which on the other hand includes representatives of countries that are the main competitors of European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us, after all, assume that the referee has not sold out to the other side and let us accept the idea that the texts by the Commission and the rapporteur respond to a real and growing problem, as the report has it, and that the fact that these matters are being considered here at the same time the Basel committee is considering them is a chance to settle them finally. Do you not think it is paradoxical to try to catch up on free America by imposing a further constraint on the European banks? Does it not seem paradoxical to translate what is no more than a recommendation to the large banks into binding provisions for EU credit institutions?</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is probably aware how grotesque it is to call for simple rules to reflect a situation that is complex and has become more complex. As for the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the Commission’s sense of the need for these measures by calling for a fast-track procedure for adopting them, we have to say that the rapporteur herself acknowledges that these new rules will have no effect on the anti-competition practices that are, alas, so widespread in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, this kind of initiative is more likely to have an effect opposite to that anticipated and to impose additional constraints on our banking sectors, without any guarantees of compensation. Despite the exhortations of Parliament, the Commission has absolutely no means of guaranteeing that the American authorities will stop discriminating against EU banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this report does have some merits, ladies and gentlemen, including the fact that it represents real progress in relation both to the first Basel text and to the Commission text. Mrs Villiers is aware of the concerns of the small and medium-sized businesses, which to a large extent depend on bank financing, and she has sensibly asked the Commission to carry out an internal assessment of the central component of its new rules, so as not to raise the cost of loan finance granted to these enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in its wisdom, Parliament decides by a majority to confirm a principle to which we should not like to see any exceptions, the Union for the Europe of Nations Group will be happy to vote for the report. If not, we will show that we are sceptical not about your work but about a procedure that we regard as a new stage in a process...</p>

I also have guests there in the public gallery. They are from Finland, and I would like to wish them welcome.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we surely agree that Europe must never encounter the same sort of profound banking crisis that we had to undergo at the start of the 1990s. We shall, however, see losses in the banking industry in the future too. When a bank suffers losses, its own resources function as a buffer, which helps to cover the losses that ordinary business profits cannot cover sufficiently. For that reason, the proposal now under discussion is of major importance, as we are trying to ensure that European banks are sound and that their clients’ savings are therefore protected. Their shareholder’s equity relies on their ability to take account as best they can of the nature and extent of banking risks. With modern techniques in risk management it is possible to gain much more precise data on risks than previously. So it is natural that the banks should also be given the opportunity to use these resources and create a more risk-sensitive working environment. To increase risk awareness both the banks’ internal and external evaluation methods must be available. In fact, I believe that internal classification will, in future, enjoy a more important status, as often it is within the banks themselves that key personnel from companies to be allowed credit are well known, as are the companies’ operations generally.</p>
<p class="contents">There is broad consensus in Parliament on the content of this proposal. Actually, the only significant difference of opinion among the groups concerns the procedure that should be applied to this proposal and other proposals on legislation on financial services in the future. Our rapporteur, Mrs Villiers, who has been responsible for some excellent work, mentioned in her report the possibility of applying a fast track method. I support her fully in this idea, as I think it is important that the financial service sector action plan be got through in accordance with the briefest possible timetable. In practice the only way to do that is to speed up the legislation procedure and agree that more issues should be handled on an emergency procedure basis.</p>

I can only congratulate Mrs Villiers on it, for as Mr von Wogau said, she has managed to cover the spectrum of banks and their clients in Europe in this good report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of matching the own capital held to cover credit risks more closely with the economic risk level and further developing the rules on own funds. We are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee's proposals only concern the large banks and external rating, while we believe it is necessary to broaden them to cover the small banks and to include internal rating. Another positive note in this regard is that it was clearly accepted that internal bank collateral mitigates risks. One reason that is so important is that purely external rating would have significantly increased the costs of loans for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the small and medium-sized businesses that create most new jobs and protect existing ones. The merit of this report is that it emphasises the links between loan costs, job creation, support for small and medium-sized businesses and the recognition of internal in addition to external ratings. We will therefore vote for it with great conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In her report, she has splendidly succeeded in reconciling the entire spectrum of opinion in our Parliament. Let me briefly address the problem that in Basel we are creating a framework for systems that are not necessarily compatible, systems in the USA and systems in Europe, and here we must ensure that we do not ride roughshod over a particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">Basel is looking primarily at the large banks. But we in Europe must look at the small banks. Their clients have few funds. We know that the large banks are no longer interested in them. Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks, as a result of higher own-funds requirements. As we keep repeating, it would be the small and medium-sized businesses that would bear the brunt, although we keep urging that they should be bolstered up. Internal and external ratings have just been discussed. I would also raise the question of portfolio straddling. We must ensure that the level of risk is assessed, and not just credit in the abstract, i.e. that we leave some room for manoeuvre in relation to small loans for small and medium-sized businesses and craft firms.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that we also make it clear that what is going on in Basel is an undemocratic procedure, that the European Parliament is the only democratically legitimate organisation that is adopting a position on this in Europe. During the procedure we must not think about whether we are surrendering rights, but about the degree of detail to which we regulate matters in Europe in future, or where we should simply establish the framework and pass on certain instruments of adjustment to other institutions, such as the Commission, but also Basel.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call on the European Central Bank and the Commission to take great care in Basel to ensure that Basel takes account of the structure of the European systems. Today we in the European Parliament must also send out the signal that we will not allow our established systems to be put at risk and that the large banks will also face problems if a legal framework is created in Europe. What we need is sufficient flexibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction to the two consultation documents on this subject – that of the European Commission and that of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – has been positive, and I should like to comment on the latter document. I appreciate that the capacity of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has nothing to do with that of the European Parliament. It has no legislative power, but nor should it be forgotten that it is a matter of actual fact that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision belongs to the Group of the Ten and that, even though it is not a legislative body, its standards apply in 130 countries and are used by a multiplicity of international organisations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, obviously, third countries. It is therefore important not to dissociate ourselves from what is happening in Basel, even though we obviously have our own legislative procedure. It is, of course, crucial that we should define our own rules to enable us, as the European Union, also to influence what is being decided in Basel.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made this initial comment, I should like to point out that I believe that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach adopted towards these regulations on capital, which help deal with the issues related to risk. The Commission believes that the high degree of support given by the report to the aforementioned approach of the Commission’s consultation paper is obviously to be welcomed. The report coincides, to a large degree, with the ideas of the Commission and the objectives we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to be especially vigilant in ensuring that the potentially most vulnerable sectors are taken into account. The report highlights a number of valid concerns regarding the possible damage that may be caused, for example in the SMEs sector, and also to our banking system and to those of our investment institutions which do not maintain a competitive level within the European Union and between the European Union and other countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that, on this point, Mr Lamfalussy has prepared a very clear and enormously useful report which may help us produce legislation that is more effective, more efficient and, so to speak, better adjusted to the changes occurring in the market. We have to confront a situation in which we must ensure that the new directives are not superseded as soon as they are adopted and that the standards under existing directives are capable of keeping pace with the rapid development of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Inflexibility and lack of adaptability are damaging the competitiveness of our financial institutions. I should like to say, in the first place, that our legislation must be sufficiently up to date and be flexible enough to respond to the rapid developments in the market. Secondly, we must avoid the excessive costs which can affect financial institutions and, consequently and indirectly, the clients of those financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought to support these objectives by means of sound and prudent standards which guarantee the security of our markets and institutions. And finally, and this is a key point, we are entirely alert to the fact that we ought to respect the institutional balance established in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at present far too soon to speak of the Commission’s adopting a formal position on these subjects, but perhaps we can define a number of outline features of the possible approach. This approach could refer to different levels. A first level would include the basic principles, or <span class="italic">codes principals</span>, to be included in certain norms such as directives. In the second place, there would be a level of technical detail covering that area which will be most subject to change if we want the regulations to reflect best practice. This could be included in annexes to these directives, and we would have to devise a satisfactory system for modifying them quickly. We would be talking about a second level of decision-making. There would also be a third level corresponding to the implementation of mechanisms enabling us to promote consistency and convergence in the area of supervision and to reinforce what is stated along those lines in the paper produced by the Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A basic point for us in the process is the way in which we seek to maintain the present institutional balance. Parliament will, in future, require that the principles underlying its decision-making should be observed by means of an agreement on this future regulation model and that these principles, to the extent that they can be applied, should be of substance and respond to more practical issues rather than to generalities. These are a few initial thoughts on how we might succeed in devising a rapid legislative process which is controllable and efficient within the current Treaty regulations. I hope that Parliament will take an active part in the discussions over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the points in the specific amendments which are to be made and which have been included in the report, I should like to make two comments. Regarding, in the first place, Amendments Nos 8 and 13: the use of an approach based on internal ratings must be introduced in a sound and prudent way. For many institutions, this approach may be neither desirable nor appropriate and, of course, its use must never be compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Right from the start, the Commission has been in favour of developing a full internal ratings system, subject to standards which may be achieved by well-managed institutions, independently of their size or of the sector in which they operate. This is a positive development we should like to see adopted by as many institutions as possible, but we appreciate that it would not be right to insist on an internal ratings system for all financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 12 on the supervisory review system, I should like to point out that it is already within the powers of the supervisors to request or establish levels in excess of the minimum capital requirements. The proposal to use this instrument solely as a type of last resort would reduce the impact of the supervisory review process as a key element of this framework. I therefore think that the position needs to remain as it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
