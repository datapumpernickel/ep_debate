From the point of view of Europe’s powers and responsibilities, its potential and goals, enlargement is the real acid test. It is also Europe’s historic duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement – the unification of this continent – brings to a close a chapter in Europe’s history and lays the foundations for the future. Through this process, the Union is preparing to shoulder responsibilities as a continent and we therefore need to take a closer look at our resources, policies and goals, at global level. Our commitment and courage must match the commitment and courage which the candidate countries are showing as they prepare to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of my mandate as President of the Commission, nothing has made a deeper impression on me than my trips to the candidate countries, my meetings with their citizens and the representatives of their governments, or my contact with their parliaments, bravely working day and night on the arduous task of bringing their societies safely through the transition consisting mainly of preparations for enlargement. In recognition of their efforts, I would like to send them a message of thanks and good wishes from the European Parliament here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are: these are countries which, barely ten years ago, were literally cut off from the Europe in which we live. Since then, they have been restoring contact with our shared values. Even before being formally admitted as new Member States, the candidate countries are starting to reap the benefits of their integration. In practice, they are already part of our area of stability and development, as is shown by the ever-increasing presence in the candidate countries of companies from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already seen extraordinary progress along the road to accession. The reports we are presenting to you today analyse as precisely as possible the countries’ preparation efforts. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Verheugen and his colleagues for their huge, unprecedented efforts, in terms of both quality and quantity, in instigating and experimenting with a truly remarkable methodology, and if we should prove to have failed at any time, it is because we really were stepping out in the dark.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, our reports show that this historic moment really is possible and just around the corner, but only if we are able to keep up this sustained pace.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into the details of the reports, which Commissioner Verheugen will be describing in a few moments, I can tell you that progress has been made in virtually all the chapters making up the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I can safely say that this remarkable progress has been greatly inspired by Nice, where, a year ago, we set out the practical stages and the ‘roadmap’, as we termed it, for the final stage of this path to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">One year from now, we will evaluate, together with Parliament, the ability of each of the candidate countries to assume the rights and responsibilities which are part and parcel of its integration into the Union. We realise that, when that time comes, we will have to have concluded, or, at least, very nearly concluded the negotiations with the countries which have met the criteria laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the conditions set by Parliament and the European Council have been complied with, and once the necessary ratification procedures are complete, these countries will be in a position to join the European Union before the June 2004 elections and thus elect representatives to this House for the next Parliamentary term. Therefore, next year will be decisive for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe. Negotiations will be tackling sensitive issues like agriculture, the Structural Funds and the budget and, in these negotiations, we will show the same determination to find constructive answers that we have shown in the past. From the beginning of the year onwards, the Commission will be putting forward proposals based on the current <span class="italic">acquis</span> and on the principles adopted at the Berlin European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will depend on the continued efforts of the candidate countries to adopt and implement the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. As the Commission stresses in its Regular Reports this year, the candidate countries will also need to develop the necessary administrative capacity to be able to apply the Union’s rules and policies properly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, sustained efforts on behalf of the candidate countries are only one side of the coin. In order for enlargement to be a success, it will be important to strengthen the Community method and sustain the necessary cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission. 2002 will be a year of intense reviewing and monitoring and I know I can count on Parliament to scrutinise this work closely.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge the Member States to continue to respect their existing commitments regarding enlargement, particularly those contained in Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective for up to 2006, as agreed by the Berlin European Council in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot make further reforms a pre-condition for enlargement, although the responsibilities which we are taking on with enlargement must prompt us to begin preparing, with considerable momentum and political vision, the new institutional process due to be launched at the Laeken European Council. Similarly, the current negotiations should not be linked to the issue of the Union’s finances after 2006, these are separate issues. Any attempt to relate them would mean changing the rules and would inevitably ultimately disrupt our carefully balanced negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports we are presenting to you also look at the implications of enlargement for the candidate countries’ neighbours, that is other European countries, and for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist attacks of 11 September against the US have completely changed the international situation. It is now less stable, less predictable and more frightening. Now, more than ever, the world needs a strong Europe which is sure of its values, which sows stability, predictability, security and prosperity around it, and which is, at last, a leading power on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, Europe’s position as the world’s leading economy and trading power, with an internal market of 500 million consumers, will be confirmed. With this situation established, we will be in a position to extend the area of stability and prosperity which we so need beyond the Union and the candidate countries. If we are to achieve this, we will need a new ‘neighbourhood policy’, and this is one of this Commission’s strategic goals.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have long maintained, and as I confirmed yesterday at the College of Europe in Bruges, we need to move beyond and expand the range of instruments available to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the partnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and our stability efforts in the Balkans. The fundamental intention is to extend liberalisation of trade, the technical standards and the laws governing our internal market to all our neighbours. The form that the appropriate agreements should take – free-trade agreements or agreements modelled on the European Economic Area agreement – will have to be determined through negotiations, but the essential objective will be to consolidate mutual economic presence.</p>
<p class="contents">Our central aim is to build a partnership with our neighbours that is as close as possible and which can become an anchor for stability and security. Basically, what we need to do is ‘export’ stability, and lay the foundations for balanced development in all areas bordering on the Union, drawing on the main strengths of European integration. This will make integration of our closest neighbours, the countries of the Western Balkans, easier when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">In our efforts, we must not, of course, neglect the importance of the cultural dimension of our partnership. This is why we are working on a new initiative to encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for Parliament’s past and present support and constructive attitude towards the enlargement process. I am counting on Parliament’s continued support during this sensitive, final phase of the negotiations. The work of the Members of this House will be crucial, not just in terms of ratification as such, but also, more generally, in terms of encouraging support for enlargement among Europe’s citizens. Opinion polls indicate that, in many parts of the Union, many citizens still need to be convinced of the overall benefits of enlargement. The Commission will, of course, continue and intensify its information strategy, but it is Parliament and its Members that can make the greatest, most effective contribution to building up the necessary democratic support for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuous involvement of this House in the enlargement process remains crucial, and not least in terms of<span class="bold"> </span>the debate on Europe’s future, a debate to which the candidate countries and future Member States are expected to make a substantial contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The report presented by the Commission today shows that the beginning of a new European era is just a few steps away. Let us take these steps together and continue and intensify our cooperation in the months to come, and thus lay the foundations for a larger, stronger, completely democratic Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will add to what President Prodi has already said by informing you of a number of things. The Commission's essential political message for today is that the desire of Parliament and of the Council to achieve the first accessions before the 2004 European elections may well be ambitious, but it is realistic and feasible. Why is this so?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because the candidate countries continue to meet the political criteria, with the exception of Turkey with which we cannot, for this reason, begin negotiations this year. Among the political criteria there are areas which still require our attention: good governance in the broadest sense of the word, international criminality, the functioning of the constitutional state – but I must repeat that the criteria have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress made in fulfilling the economic criteria means that ten of the candidate countries are functioning market economies and are also either now, or will be in the near future, in a position to cope with the competitive pressure in the internal market. These are all countries with which we have opened negotiations, with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, where though, I must openly say, there has also been significant progress. Particularly in Romania's case, the Commission considers it important to note that, for the first time, there is real progress in terms of political, economic and social reform, something which will be shown clearly only in the next progress report.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the adoption of the acquis, this is reflected, above all, in the progress made in the negotiations, of which you are all well aware. So far, we have achieved all that was envisaged in the framework of the negotiating timetable, and therefore the negotiating timetable fixed at Nice will continue to be the keynote of our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually new about this year's report is that we are now concentrating very intently on the last remaining, and very substantial, problem, namely how to ensure that the future Member countries, at the time of accession, will have the administrative capacity to meet all the obligations of a Member of the European Union. For the avoidance of doubt, let me say that as yet they do not. Not one of the candidate countries at present fully meets all three criteria. The Commission therefore proposes the realisation of a special action plan to improve the candidate countries' implementation capacity. We are therefore also making extensive additional resources available. We will inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome as early as the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want there to be any misapprehensions here. If the progress reports focus heavily on the shortfalls that we still have today, this is simply because we cannot repeat every year what has already been done, but the nearer we come to the objective of the negotiations, all the more clearly do we see the problems that still remain. In order to have the full picture, though, we must see the remaining problems against the background of the enormous progress that has been made over the past few years. Only then do we get things in the right perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is possible to reduce the existing administrative and legal shortcomings in due time for the candidate countries to have adequate implementation capacity when they accede. To put it very plainly: the Commission will no doubt have to give final opinions next year, and by that point there must be no more deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in addition, that the accession negotiations with Cyprus are well advanced. It is our strategic goal to take in a united Cyprus as a new member. This requires constructive and substantial progress towards a lasting peace solution. I therefore reiterate my appeal to all concerned to make use of the ‘window of opportunity’ to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The pre-accession strategy for Turkey is showing the first positive results. The constitutional reform recently adopted by the Turkish Parliament is a step in the right direction, but further reforms are necessary, especially in regard to effective protection of human rights and the implementation of economic reforms. The Commission considers that it is now time to intensify the pre-accession strategy. A more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront. We have, though, not yet progressed to the point where we can propose starting on Turkey's screening.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year we will be embarking on the most politically sensitive stage of the accession negotiations. We will lay down a general framework for the negotiation of the financial chapter which ensures that it can be dealt with in a common framework, and we will be doing this very early in 2002, so that the Spanish Presidency will have the chance to keep to the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are confident that the enlargement negotiations can be successfully completely on the basis of the current <span class="italic">acquis</span>. In our proposal, we will strictly observe the expenditure limits of Agenda 2000. We will thus make no proposals going beyond them, nor will we make proposals binding the European Union beyond 2006, so that it is perfectly clear that the Commission's strategy involves no financial risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me add that negotiations are currently concerned with issues, the resolution of which will have direct impact on the living conditions of citizens in the accession countries. The decisions made now will influence either positively or negatively the acceptance of the accessions in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore make every effort to give the citizens in today's and tomorrow's Member States all the information about enlargement. No partner should be subjected to excessive demands in the accession process. It is therefore essential that negotiations be both flexible and result-oriented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, then, on the basis of next year's progress reports, submit recommendations on the readiness for accession of those countries that are adequately prepared. It will make every effort to ensure that negotiations with these countries can be concluded successfully.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">It will also produce a revised pre-accession strategy for those countries which are unable or unwilling to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002. These countries must not be made to feel that they are being left behind. They therefore require special attention and special instruments, which we will be proposing in the 2002 Strategy Paper.</span></p>

Let me say first, Mr President of the Commission, that we are glad to see you here. We were, though, somewhat astonished to see your name appear on the monitor during our bureau meeting. It took us by surprise, which may have been a mistake by our group. We do, of course, make mistakes, but in general, according to what I hear around the place, it was not known that the President of the Commission was going to be here this afternoon. We are glad that you are here, even though we would have liked prior notice.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point, to which I would also like an answer, is that I was told this morning while the Group Chairmen were holding press conferences, that Mr Verheugen had also held a press conference. I would be very interested to know, Commissioner, whether it was on the subject to which you have just been speaking. If you can shed some light on that, then so much the better.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my questions. First, let me inform you that our group's leaders had a meeting in Hungary last week. There was grave concern in Hungary that the enlargement could, for them, be delayed if in another country, namely Poland, developments were not proceeding as quickly as might be wished. Of course, we all want Poland to be in the first round of enlargement, but a consequence of that must not be that, if a Member country is not yet ready, the others have to wait and we cannot keep to the 2004 deadline. Each country must be assessed on its own merits if enlargement is to be able to take place at all. I would be obliged if you could say something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I then have a very specific question. There was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the 'status law' on Hungarians in other countries. This law was adopted by 95% of the Hungarian Parliament, and a commission of the European Council, the so-called Venice Commission, explicitly stated that this law was acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">One last question: How do you see the overcoming of the past with reference to some EU countries today? I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland, for example. Can you say something more about that? Can we take as our starting point statements which, if these countries join the European Union, will make it possible for them to have a future with a clear record, which we of course very much want? We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well then, we need to make it clear once and for all that good progress is being made, and by ‘good progress’ we mean good progress for Poland as well. This country has made excellent progress, and so there is no need to put Poland in a different category from the others.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, or rather I must express my utmost satisfaction at the fact that, looking back at the rate of progress, it is apparent that Poland has displayed remarkable energy and ability in this race, on this journey towards enlargement, towards accession.

We abide fully by what we agreed. It is for that reason that the press conference is to take place at 6 p.m., after Parliament has been informed. I regularly talk to journalists, as you well know. There was, though, no press conference, and that is an important distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Hungarian law on status is concerned, we notified the Hungarian government of problems with this law from the point of view of the acquis communautaire even before the law was enacted. These problems were then taken into legislative account, so that we have no problems with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">My estimation of the Venice Commission differs from your own. The Venice Commission ruled that whether the Hungarian Status Law is contrary to international law or not is dependent on the way it is implemented. We have therefore had discussions for some time with the Hungarian government and with the governments of neighbouring countries in order to ensure that Hungary's neighbours are involved in finding a way of implementing it on which they can all agree. The Hungarian government is thankfully endeavouring to bring this about, and the Romanian and Slovak governments are also ready to play their part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Benes decrees have not to date been the subject of negotiations, since property issues, as you well know, are not covered by Community law. As regards the acquisition of land, I expect something to happen very quickly in the relevant negotiations with Poland. During my visit to Warsaw last week, the Polish government announced that it would be taking a flexible approach to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to Mr Verheugen: You have announced that there will be additional resources or an additional programme for modernising and adapting administration. I would be interested to know whether these are financial resources deducted from other programmes for these countries on an anticipatory basis. Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly.</p>
<p class="contents">My second is this: Commissioner, the Court of Auditors' report that we discussed today criticises the Commission for the absence of definite criteria in its programmes to reinforce atomic power stations, that is, to increase the safety of their reactors. Are you prepared to consider the possibility that the Commission is not drawing up any criteria, that is to say, any general criteria, but only criteria for checking reactor safety improvement measures, carried out with the support of Commission resources?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question, concerning Cyprus and Turkey, has already been briefly alluded to. The Turkish Prime Minister has just made statements in what may be a new form, to the effect that, if it came to it, the northern part of Cyprus might be annexed. Does the Commission have a clear, official and unambiguous answer to this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, resources for the additional measures to improve implementation are being taken from the Phare budget, so additional resources are not being drawn on, nor are resources being transferred. This is, rather, a change of priorities in Phare's programming, something of which, by the way, I informed Parliament some time ago. We had also said that we were ready to adjust priorities in view of the fallout from 11 September, if it were a question of meeting stricter conditions in internal and legal policy, police cooperation and the securing of our external frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission has no authority in matters of reactor safety. I do not know what the Court of Auditors is referring to in this instance; it may be to the work of the Council working party on nuclear energy issues, which, however, is not a Commission office. The Commission is in no way responsible and is not involved in any steps to improve nuclear safety in candidate countries. All the Commission does is to negotiate the required decommissioning of the reactors, regarded by the Member States as incapable of being retrofitted, with the relevant countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia and then go on to implement such decommissioning. This has to a large degree been completed, as you know. We still await a final closure date for Ignalina II in Lithuania and an offer of finance for this, still outstanding, is expected in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, we in the Commission have nothing to do with the construction of further nuclear power stations in Central and Eastern European countries. I must say quite frankly that this is the first time I have heard of this criticism by the Court of Auditors. I would myself be very grateful, and I imagine the President would be too, if the Commission were to have responsibility for nuclear safety standards. I must, though, tell you that the Member States, and you as an Austrian Member will know how watchful the Member States are in the Melk process in which the Commission is mediating between Austria and the Czech Republic, determinedly refuse to let the Commission create conditions that would lead to the rise of European Community law on reactor safety standards. I am, though, quite happy to come back to this subject when I have been informed about this report by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Turkish Prime Minister's statement, what Mr Ecevit has said is nothing new to me; I have heard it in many conversations with him and read it in articles by him for over a year. Our response is quite clear. If, first condition, no political reunification of Cyprus is achieved; if, second presupposition, the Member States decide, and Parliament agrees, that Cyprus should be admitted in any case; and if, thirdly, Turkey were then to react in that way – all hypothetical questions at present – if, though, that were to happen, it would result in probably the worst crisis ever in relations between Turkey and the European Union. I do not at present see how we could quickly extricate ourselves from such a crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How will the institutions in general, in particular the Member States, judge, and by what criteria will they judge, whether the applicants have arrived at the happy state of having an implementation capacity? I share and salute the headline goal, but I wonder what is its measurable content?</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that in Parliament we have not had the opportunity yet to read all these contrary reports which have been adopted. But given the comments that the Commissioner has just made about Turkey, could he characterise – because we have not yet had the chance to study it – the political mood of the Turkey report? I hope it is a report which gives sufficient and due recognition to serious attempts at change. There are serious deficiencies which remain, but engagement with Turkey in the light of the earlier comments is an even more profound necessity in the near future than it has been in the recent past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The monitoring of progress in the capacity to implement is a standard procedure that we have developed over a considerable time. We simply observe what legislation was taken over, and whether adequate material and human resources were available to make this legislation a reality. It goes without saying that we also observe whether it actually works in practice. This monitoring is going on constantly. The information required for it comes to us from the most diverse sources, not only from our own, but also, for example, information is used which comes to us from Parliament. We have a system that puts us in a position to say at any time to any given country how far we have got with their capacity to implement. This procedure has been well established and has proved its worth.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, I can tell the honourable gentleman that the current picture presents varied aspects. There are positive things in it. One is no doubt that the Accession Partnership is now working in all its aspects. All its elements are present and are being kept to. In this respect, relations between us and Turkey were never before as close as they are now. Another positive element is no doubt the remarkable progress being made in constitutional reform and also in legislative matters, towards democratisation and respect for human rights. This is surely still dependent on the extent to which these constitutional changes and legislation are actually experienced in the country's day-to-day reality.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been no progress in the economic sphere. So much is well known. There has been remarkable progress in conforming to the acquis. That is the good I have to report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the negative side, I have to say that, as already stated, the human rights situation is still unsatisfactory. I must say that I had expected more from Turkey by way of cooperation in resolving the Cyprus issue. We have already discussed this in another context. I am also disappointed by Turkey's conduct as regards the issue of European security and defence policy. I do not find it appropriate for a country desirous of being a member of the European Union to hinder the European Union from making progress with a significant aspect of integration. This is, in my view, not the sort of behaviour that we should expect of a candidate country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My feeling is that, in this regard, we are proceeding almost without any safety net at all, for such a reaction would involve the annexing of part of the territory of the European Union. It may be that we should safeguard ourselves against such an eventuality and allow ourselves a moment’s reflection before coming up against this situation, which I feel is so very sensitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free trade agreements between two candidate countries would in fact create problems if these countries were then to accede at different times. I must say, though, that the problem is a very limited one, as the countries you have mentioned are covered by the Europe Agreements, which already provide for quite wide-ranging liberalisation of trade in goods, and also of the traffic in services and other economic relations, so that a European solution can be found for this problem should it eventually arise. I do not, though, think it likely that it will.</p>
<p class="contents">The question about Croatia is outside my remit; I would have to ask the President to say something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, speaking of Cyprus, that I clearly stated that you were putting hypothetical questions. I do not as a rule like answering hypothetical questions, but you were entitled to an assessment of the situation. I did also say, though, that the Commission has not changed the clear line it has taken, that we must do everything, yes everything, to achieve a political solution to the conflict before accession negotiations are completed. I have repeatedly appealed to all parties and must again say clearly that it is in the particular interest of the Turkish Cypriot community that a political solution be found before the accessions take place, as nobody will profit as much as the Turkish Cypriot community from Cyprus' membership of the European Union. For that reason, any policy that bars access to the European Union to the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus is a policy which directly, clearly and unambiguously works against the interests of the people there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to say that I find it a very good thing that the Commission is at last turning its mind to supporting the strengthening of administration. But my question is whether it is also going to look at the need for administration to really involve the citizens, so that things that go without saying, here in the European Union, are also put into practice there?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the action plan and finance. If you are allocating more resources from the Phare programme for the support of the institutions, does that then mean that resources are being removed from the other important area of social and economic cohesion, in other words that we are no longer supporting the halting of increasing social decay, which is a core problem in these countries, even though it is urgently necessary?</p>
<p class="contents">My last question concerns a point which the report does not mention at all. Does the Commission intend to encourage the Council to publish a European programme for the Roma people, something which is in my view urgently required? In almost all countries at present, the Roma minority's human and democratic rights are being violated as much as they have been in the past. This can clearly not be resolved by these accession candidates on an individual basis; it is a European issue that must be dealt with by a European programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the resources about which Mr Swoboda has already asked are not taken from the country-specific programmes, but are multi-country programmes, which relate to all countries and which, if you want to put it that way, are kept in the central reserve. No one country therefore receives one single euro less from the projects which have been discussed up to now. The burden is not therefore borne by other projects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of a European Roma project: this has not yet in fact been included in the Commission's proposals. Discussion of the subject is already in progress in some of the candidate countries, which are saying that this is a European problem and must therefore be dealt with by a European Community programme. As far as I am aware, this approach is not shared by most of the Member countries. In any case, a specific European Roma programme would require significant material resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not as yet made such a proposal, but is concentrating on helping the candidate countries with the implementation of their national strategies to integrate the Roma. Perhaps I should point out that we have very strict requirements on this point and demand of all the candidate countries with a Roma population that they present and implement a medium-term strategy towards the social integration of the Roma and the removal of social discrimination. As you know, we are giving these programmes very substantial support by means of pre-accession instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions. Perhaps it should again be highlighted in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question I would like to put is this. In your report, you are very optimistic that ten countries will have the chance to sign the Accession Treaty at the end of next year. As you have expressed it, but I believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly: that is the assessment of today. This means that, if countries fall behind next year because of poor performance on the political front, the list could well comprise fewer than ten, so that great individual efforts will be necessary and today's judgment will offer no security. To this will, of course, be added the issues of implementation and of administrative capacity. Your paper points out that work will be being done on implementation even after the Treaty is signed. What certainty will there be, though, on the day the Treaty is signed, that administrative capacity will actually be in place when accession becomes effective? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sometimes feel that at one point or another we are demanding of the candidate countries something that the Member States are not doing themselves. This, though, has to do with the criteria we have and our obligation to report very precisely on the extent to which they are complied with – or not, as the case may be. Today, I said to the Commission, and on the same subject, that we must always imagine what progress reports would look like if the same criteria were applied to the Member States. The Member States would never allow us to do any such thing, but so much of what we criticise in candidate countries or describe as incompatible with the Copenhagen criteria, could, perhaps, also be found in one Member State or another. So, at this point, I recommend modesty to our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing more can, of course, be demanded in the negotiations themselves than is required of the Member States. The negotiations are very precisely attuned to the acquis and to nothing else. They touch on nothing else. The problem you have described can therefore only arise when considering the question of whether candidate countries comply with the indeed very vaguely formulated political or economic accession criteria. My answer is that it may be that we are sometimes asking for more.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other question of the ten countries, the Commission said today in fact, that we must prepare for the accession of all those which have complied with the conditions and completed negotiations by the end of 2002. This represents rejection of the idea of forming what might be termed political groups, and is, in the Commission's judgment, the correct interpretation of the Helsinki and Gothenburg Decisions. It was stated in Helsinki that all countries that had been invited to negotiate should have a chance to conclude, which can only mean that it was considered that their accessions could be simultaneous with those of the countries which had been negotiating since Luxembourg, and Gothenburg envisaged the first accessions taking place before 2004. It necessarily follows from this that we must prepare for the accession of up to ten countries, I will not say ten, but up to ten, because ten countries have set themselves the goal of completing negotiations by 2002. Whether it will actually come to that, I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will produce its concluding opinion next year, and will do so in strict accordance with the principles and rules that it itself has proposed. As I said here in Parliament during the most recent discussion on enlargement, it is a subject on which we cannot let ourselves make political decisions as it were in the worst or narrowest sense of the word, that is, saying on the basis of purely political considerations that one country is coming in and another is not. Such a decision must much rather be founded on compliance with the criteria and on the outcome of the negotiations. The Commission's proposal will be couched in those terms.</p>
<p class="contents">None of the ten countries that currently believe they will manage it can evade the possibility of us saying at the end of the day: this country is not ready. Let me say it clearly: none of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures with which I am acquainted indicate the precise opposite. Quite apart from that, public opinion on the subject is, if I may say so, extraordinarily fickle. It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when. In this way, you can obtain quite different results in the same country at the same time. I know all the surveys that are being done, and my analysis is that we must not work on the assumption that we are dealing with dwindling support.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards communications strategy, the European Parliament, and you as a Member of it will be aware of this, has considered it right, for reasons it has made known to us, to make the funds available relatively late in the day, only, in fact, in the course of this year. The truth is that all the measures could be put in motion only after the summer recess. You cannot expect that I should be able to supply you with some sort of report on the results of a campaign that started only eight weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I must make it clear that this is outside the Commission's remit. The Commission made its proposal on the implementation of a communication strategy in April 2000, therefore only a few months after we took office. That it took so long for this strategy to become reality in the European institutions is in this instance regrettable. I do not believe, though, that it is too late, because only now that the results of negotiations are becoming evident is it right and necessary to fully apply this strategy. This strategy is in no way about indoctrinating people or, as you have suggested, convincing them of advantages, but about giving them an objective basis on which to form their own opinions and judgments. The Commission would indeed not be permitted to do more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said this, I would remind you that this was a question and answer session. It is true that some Members far exceeded their allotted speaking time. Should I have cut them off because of that? You are well aware that that is not my way of doing things. I am sure you will also understand that I naturally had to give precedence to the rapporteurs, to those who have worked as rapporteurs on this subject. I would also point out, for your information, that a number of rapporteurs were unfortunately unable to take the floor, including three from the European People’s Party: Mrs Carlsson, Mrs Stenzel and Mr Van Orden, not to mention Mr Haarder and Mr Beazley.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see, Mr Titley, how difficult this was to manage. I think that Parliament should make a decision, but it should be aware that if the question and answer session overruns, and I would gladly have extended it by a good half-hour, as I think the subject deserved it, the time devoted to questions to the Commission may have to be reduced. You can imagine the reaction of your fellow Members who, as you know, are extremely anxious that the time allocated to questions to the Commission be scrupulously observed. You know that, when this is not the case, those Members call us to task and they are quite right to do so. I have tried to act for the best. If I was wrong, I apologise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
