<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Virrankoski (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, draft supplementary and amending budget no. 2/2000 contains appropriations for the Council and for Parliament. The Council’s budget is EUR 6.635 million. This is going towards the needs of a common foreign and security and defence policy. EUR 5.877 million are estimated to be required for renting, renovating and furnishing a new building. This building will be for the needs of the staff required to implement the policy. EU military staff will be posted there, for example, including military experts who have been transferred from Member States. They may be around 45 at first, but that number may later grow to 60 or even 90. Their pay will amount to EUR 758 000 by the end of the year. Under the old gentleman’s agreement, neither institution – neither the Council nor Parliament – has become involved in the other’s draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft supplementary and amending budget for the European Parliament contains an appropriation of EUR 15 million for an additional prepayment for office space in Brussels. This will reduce annual interest by EUR 2.2 million over a ten-year period. This will leave a margin in the financial perspectives of EUR 69.1 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets transferred EUR 38 million of unused funds this year by means of a C6/2000 to fund this office space, the Spinelli building. As the President has also been able to transfer funds for this purpose, altogether at this stage we can use around EUR 58 million for accelerated payments, which will lessen annual payments over the ten-year period by around EUR 8 to 9 million for Parliament, which is a great relief. It is only reasonable that the European Parliament should pay for its office space ahead of time. In that way interest payments are saved and, at the same time, we have a little room for manoeuvre in the budget for the years to come. We shall need this, as, with eastward enlargement, Parliament’s other expenses will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s share of Category 5 expenses, or administrative expenses, in supplementary and amending budget no. 2/2000 will now rise to 20.41%, which is just over the 20% ceiling that Parliament itself set. Originally, when the budget was being drafted, the share of administrative expenses was to remain below 20%. As it is very likely that a considerable portion of the appropriations set aside for members’ regulations, for example, (which amount to EUR 60 million), will remain unspent, and as more than half the year has now gone by, this ceiling may be reviewed at the end of the year. On the other hand we must realise that Parliament is saving money, as the investment it is making is a most prudent one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s budget is interesting, as there are appropriations in it for the first time for a common security and defence policy. Structures are being created for the Council for the defence dimension to be tied more tightly to the work of the EU, in accordance with the conclusions of the Helsinki Summit. This will be an extremely difficult issue for the small, non-aligned countries, such as Finland, for example. The scars left behind in Kosovo, after the crisis management operation, are frightening. How justified is humanitarian military action, and what are its limits? A big problem will be future budget technology. Article 28 of the Treaty is unclear, particularly regarding a common security, defence and military policy. Administrative expenditure is part of the EU budget, but the Council has discretionary powers with regard to operational expenses. What then is to be the practice in future, and how much of this expenditure will we try to place under Category 4. – External Action – which is already now overburdened? In future talks, the classification of expenditure must be made clearer and executed more effectively, to comply with Parliament’s wishes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The supplementary and amending budget presented here should not pose any major problems for the simple reason that, if adopted – and it is good to see that Parliament has an opportunity to introduce several elements and budgetary choices that suit it and are to its liking, generally speaking, it is a draft that the Council will consider positive as well. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as far as this draft budget is concerned, the Council is the outright winner and legitimately so; not by scoring a victory against us, rather it is a winner all round. This is because this budget is essentially designed to enable the Council to recover the surplus balances from last year, which amount to EUR 3.2 billion. It includes a lower contribution in terms of the British rebate and a greater yield in own resources, for example customs duties, all of which is deducted from the costs it has to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft presented here can therefore be considered positively by both the Council and Parliament. This is firstly because during the trialogue, we all agreed that the budget presented should not be limited to merely returning the balances to the Member States, but should also include expenditure and constitute a genuine supplementary and amending budget. For Parliament this represents a limited victory but a significant one nonetheless. </p>
<p class="contents">In the second place, we have made several decisions that can be viewed in a positive light. First, we have introduced a special contribution for orphan drugs of up to EUR 1 million. Thanks to the legal basis that now exists we are able to fund these orphan drugs. This is considered a priority by the committee responsible, the Committee on Budgets and Parliament itself. </p>
<p class="contents">Second – and this is the second major contribution to the issue – we have introduced extra resources, which total some EUR 11 million. Five million are to go to the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and six million to the United Nations interim mission in Kosovo to fund the interim civil administrations. Once again, the legal bases exist to make these possible. We have the resources, the needs are there, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are top priorities and we have chosen to finance them, but the question is how. This is to be achieved using commitment appropriations from the ECIP appropriations that no longer serve a purpose and, though they exist as appropriations, the absence of legal basis means that they cannot be used. It is therefore expenditure that has been secured by a sacrifice that barely costs us anything. </p>
<p class="contents">The third significant element relates to the financing of the special aid for Montenegro. You will be aware that we were all against this aid being financed with resources from other foreign programmes, in particular the MEDA programme. We therefore decided to fund it using the margin which totals 21 million in this heading. We need 20 million. Budgetary history works in our favour in this case and by using almost this entire margin, this initiative can be financed without any reduction or transfer from other appropriations, which is highly satisfactory. </p>
<p class="contents">Now – and I shall end on this point – the main question that remains to be answered is whether or not the Council will support us from a procedural point of view. We have had a first reading in the Council, this is our first reading, and we should very much like to conclude matters on the basis of this first reading. In other words, we hope that the Council’s second reading that takes place on 20 July will take up our first reading, if not we shall have to proceed to a second reading. I do not believe that it would be in the Council’s interest – and it is a pity that they are not present this evening – to do this. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I should like to stress another important point in that if we proceed to a second reading, in order to adhere to the strict timetables set, we should have to attend a session in August in order to vote on this SAB at second reading, which is obviously out of the question. It has always been the rule in Parliament and the other institutions that August is excluded from the timetables set. I am sure that the Council will adhere to that rule as it is in their interests, our interests and both of our interests to agree on both the procedure to adopt as well as the substance of the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, we are not handing out gifts; we are returning the money to its original owners, i.e. the Member States and, at the end of the day, the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows that we are handling funds properly and the rapporteur, my friend Jean-Louis Bourlanges, has just set the facts of the matter out clearly for us. I should like to extend my warmest thanks to both him and Mr Virrankoski for the supplementary budget, which applies mainly to Parliament and the Council. We are spending funds economically, that is our main job. We are handling funds properly, and that too is our main job. This was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one comment to the Council. I hope now the building is finally ready that Mr Solana will at last be able to move in with his work and his top secret documents. We really do have more important things to worry about than how to hide papers from unwanted visitors. That was why I voted passionately in favour of this transfer of funds, so that these technical problems can be solved once and for all and nothing more can stand in the way of a successful European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Parliament is concerned, we have used our supplementary budget to reduce interest payments still further. This gives us room for manoeuvre within the margin which we set for ourselves in category 5 and ensures that we can use the money reasonably and sustainably for parliamentary work and not for interest payments as part of our building policy, which is why the PPE will, of course, be voting in favour of both the Bourlanges and Virrankoski reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing much to add in principle to what has already been said. We too shall, of course, be voting in favour of the two reports. What I have to say refers to supplementary and amending budget 1 which, as Mr Ferber has just said, brings Christmas in July for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has the enviable task of being able to claw back and budget EUR 3.2 billion. If only we could attract the same intensive and intense attention and discussion when we discuss the fact that we are looking for 200 million in order to balance the budget next year and finance a task which has a huge effect on Europe, i.e. Kosovo or the Balkans as a whole. The figure under discussion at present is 3.2 billion, i.e. sixteen times that amount, and it will rightly be refunded, on that I have no doubt. The figure of 200 million will then probably be discussed elsewhere. We had this problem last year and we shall no doubt face a similar problem again this year. In terms of order of size, it may perhaps be a little more, but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve. My request to the Council is: bear this in mind, including for the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wonderful of course if we did not have to give back all the money which we are now refunding, if there were an agreement between the Council and Parliament whereby we could retain some of the money for contingencies. That would, of course, enable us to change the whole modus operandi between us in the future. I admit it is a highly unusual proposal, but we should consider the possibility of a reserve for contingencies. I think that would help to defuse individual budget debates.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address another two parts of the supplementary budget. The first is that, thanks to the excellent proposal by our rapporteur Mr Bourlanges, we have indeed managed to provide 20 million for Montenegro, where we have agreed to urgent procedure. However, we must find this 20 million by squeezing the margin dry. We cannot use the 3.2 billion; instead we must squeeze the margin dry. We do not need to be told, as the English say, to put our money where our mouth is, i.e. where it is needed; on the contrary, we are giving the money back and then looking around for spare change in order to perform our duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Council to be a little more circumspect in its announcements and promises in the future unless, at the same time, it intends to tell us what we should cross out elsewhere. I can only ask the Council in the present procedure – relating to supplementary budget 1 – not to cause any more problems by withholding its approval. It really would be most welcome for the forthcoming budgetary procedure if the Council could be accommodating here and vote with us. That would be a good sign and could shape the forthcoming budget debates. My request to the Council is: please proceed as I suggest; we shall be more than happy to acknowledge such a procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the rapporteur has already explained the SAB is asking to approve two separate sums of money. I hope that these sums have been arrived at after taking good account of the principles of budgetary prudence and value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">The political decision to approve the building for Mr Solana and the 45 military personnel had already been taken by the fifteen Member States at Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise three issues about this. Firstly, it is not clear why the military personnel in the building should be counted as administrative expenditure. They would more appropriately come under the heading of operational expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I understand there is a gentlemen's agreement according to which the European Parliament and the Council agreed not to interfere with each other's budget. I believe this has been pushed to its limit. The Council's interpretation of the gentlemen's agreement is certainly imaginative. The agreement applies to buildings and Council staff but not necessarily to seconded military personnel, whose salary comes from their own Member State. However their overheads would be paid for by the EU in the future with no real monitoring or accountability role by any institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am not satisfied with the use of the SAB as an instrument for this because these extra needs were foreseen prior to the conclusion of the budgetary process last year and should have been incorporated in this year's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the spirit of the gentlemen's agreement, I will not comment on the need for 45 military personnel in the building. That will surely be as safe as Fort Knox. The point I wish to raise here is that Council must apply the same sort of budgetary rigour to its administrative expenditure as it expects of other institutions. And I would like some reassurance in the future that this expenditure will be spent in the most efficient and economic way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On Parliament's request for the extra 15 million for the additional advance payment for the new building in Brussels, although it can be identified as a prudent step which will allow considerable savings in the future, I am concerned about the messages that this may convey. I believe it is crucial for Parliament to introduce activity-based budgeting as a matter of utmost urgency.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply wanted to say that one of Parliament’s amendments included the creation, in B5-671N, of a line for financing a ‘Rapid Reaction Facility’ which is designed – pursuant to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline – to make it possible, thanks to a token entry, to allocate sufficient resources when the regulation is finally adopted. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy considers this a priority and I regret not mentioning it earlier.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first proposed amending budget relates to the Commission's budget. The second relates to the Council's and Parliament's budget, in both cases on the question of building policy. While the extra 15 million granted by Parliament is to be used to pay off the buildings early, thereby saving interest in the future, the extra Council expenditure will give rise to further expenditure in the future because other buildings will be rented in Brussels to house sectors such as the security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner responsible for budgets, I naturally take a more kindly view of expenditure which saves money in the future – that is meant as a little dig at the Council, which is not yet here – although the Council's concerns are also well founded. If new tasks are to be adopted, then they need to be given staffing and administrative support. I only hope that the Council also grants the Commission the same courtesy and does not use one sauce for the goose and one for the gander.</p>
<p class="contents">Supplementary and amending budget 1 contains important amendments on the income side – as has been stressed – and on the expenditure side of the Budget 2000. On the income side, the refund of the surplus EUR 3.2 billion from 1999, as already mentioned. A number of other important corrections have also been made, meaning that contributions for the year 2000 can now be finalised. On the expenditure side, the following amendments have been made: provision has been made in the budget for the planned Repatriation Fund for non-military intervention in crisis areas, as already mentioned by the rapporteur. The funding for the UNMIK high representative in Kosovo and Bosnia has been amended and EUR 11 million will now be provided. For Montenegro, additional aid of EUR 20 million is to be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteurs and to tell the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, that the Commission has accepted all Parliament's proposed amendments, even where, for example in the case of Montenegro, the remaining margin is extremely tight, but that means we must be economical and that is what we intend to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will do its best to ensure that the Council does not take this to a second reading, thereby postponing the resolution until September. Perhaps the reduction in payments will be incentive enough for the Council to follow Parliament's example in coming to a rapid decision, for which I should like once again to thank the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
