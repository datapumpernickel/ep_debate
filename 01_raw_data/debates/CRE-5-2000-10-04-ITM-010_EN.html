It proposes guidelines for future Union research activities, for the period 2002-2006, and more especially for the Union's future Research Framework Programme. The aim is to define the specific contribution that this will make to the creation of a European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of its Resolution of 18 May 2000, this Parliament lent its firm support to this project, which is now being put into action. A group of representatives from the Member States has therefore been set up to deal with the issues of benchmarking and the mapping of excellence, and this group is currently working with the Commission. A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next Research Council. The initial results will be presented to the European Council meeting scheduled for next March, which aims to address general economic and social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is clear that the Union's Research Framework Programme also has a more specific role to play. Before it can do so, however, there is a need for a comprehensive review of its design, the conditions under which it is implemented and, more specifically, its methods of intervention. The guidelines set out in the Communication adopted this morning have been defined with this in mind, on the basis, in particular, of the conclusions of the report on the five-year assessment of research programmes, drawn up by a panel of independent experts, and the mid-term review of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, carried out by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines have been defined in such a way as to enable European research to be structured more efficiently via the European Union's research programme. They are based on the following principles: a switch from an approach centred on individual research projects to a broader approach, based on a set of cohesive actions of which European Union measures will constitute but a part. A real concentration of efforts in areas where action at Community level will generate a plus: that of European added value. Such areas would be pinpointed by applying criteria for defining this added value in terms of creating rankings and exclusion. The introduction of types of intervention of longer duration; half-way houses between support for projects and institutional financing, the use of the variable geometry instruments available under the Treaty, and, more specifically, European Union participation in national programmes, as provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In tangible terms, there is, among other things, a proposal to have recourse to formulae such as the networking of national programmes through support for the mutual opening-up of programmes and, above all, European Union participation in programmes carried out in a coordinated fashion; the creation of European networks of excellence by networking existing capacities in the Member States around joint programmes of activities; the carrying out of large targeted research projects conducted by consortia of companies, universities and research centres, on the basis of overall financing plans; greater backing for regional and national efforts in support of innovation and research conducted by small- and medium-sized companies; reinforcing and diversifying action in support of research infrastructures of European interest; the increasing and diversification of mobility grants and, in general terms, measures in the field of human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">These new methods of intervention are the result of new methods of management. They will significantly enhance the impact of the measures taken under the current framework programme to increase the scale of projects and to simplify procedures. The guideline document adopted today is designed to trigger debate immediately, beginning with debate within the institutions. On the basis of the outcome of this debate, the Commission will present its formal proposals for the Research Framework Programme for 2002-2006, next February. These proposals will become part of a series of specific Communications, each of which represents a contribution to the establishment of a European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">I will have be able to present these guidelines in detailed fashion and discuss them at length at the meeting of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is scheduled for 12 October, but I look forward to hearing Parliament’s views on this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to reply to Mrs McNally: the issue of European added value formed part of the criteria for calls for proposals, which already comprised a series of elements such as, for example, the multinational dimension, the fact that there are several Member States, the fact of these being projects which were more or less European in scale. These were therefore elements which already existed. But to date there had not necessarily been any form of ranking or factors dictating exclusion. This ranking is precisely the characteristic that we want to enhance, and it is dependent on the level of the method of intervention. There is a need to strike a balance between a genuine ranking and avoiding additional bureaucracy. This is the discussion on criteria that we will be having with the Member States, of course, and also with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Joint Research Centre, the idea is to make this a key centre for common reference, for joint expertise. It has an important role to play. You are well aware of the need to centre the actions of the Joint Research Centre on areas in which it can fulfil this role of European added value, by virtue of the fact that it does not depend on the private sector and is independent of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of SMEs, we have, of course, been careful to ensure that SMEs play a part in the framework programme, as was stipulated in the budget decision. Only this afternoon I witnessed a fine demonstration. I do not know whether you have seen the new types of fireman’s helmet that have been developed as the result of a partnership between German, French and Dutch firms and the TNO Research Centre, which constitute a new generation of fireman’s helmet developed by SMEs. This is a very striking example of what we have achieved in this area. With regard to the actions that we propose, page 16 of the policy paper<span class="bold"> </span>sets out the new ways in which we are thinking of working, with greater decentralisation towards associations and towards national structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as concerns mobility, Mr Linkohr, you will be aware of just how much this issue, and all its social implications, is of concern to us. The Mobility group has been set up at Commission level, with the various Member States, and is to hold its first meeting on 20 October. This group consists of the representatives of Research Ministers, but also actual Ministers for Social Affairs and Home Affairs, to overcome obstacles to mobility, such as problems concerning pensions and freedom of movement on European territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said that you have a total shake-up of the framework programme in mind. We have tried to do this with the fifth framework programme and, as it now transpires, with very little effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In a resolution quoted by yourself, which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur, I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research, since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines. I cannot find any reference to this in your report which I have now read and which you adopted this week. My second point, Commissioner, is that you recommend the European Union to take part in national programmes. I have also written that, in Europe, we need to move away from techno-nationalism, but once again if the framework programme is what we are concerned with, this Parliament – and I repeat this very Parliament – plays a crucial role, and how will Parliament’s role take shape if we apply variable geometry? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In discussions and contacts I have had with the research community, especially in Greece, there is great concern about whether the Commission is in favour of downgrading basic research. At least that is what seems to be coming out of the budget debate in Greece, and many people are calling upon the European Union to make its views clear. Is this true, and at the very time the United States appears to be doubling its funding for basic research? If it is not true, should basic research not be intensified in all countries, large or small, in line, of course, with the value placed on their centres and researchers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to ask you to award particular attention to the relations between the STOA Unit<span class="bold"> </span>and matters that concern your Directorate for which you have responsibility, because problems exist in this regard. Many research-related matters selected by the STOA Unit are then poorly received by the Commission departments. This issue should therefore be discussed with you, particularly in connection with the Joint Research Centre (JRC).</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to ask you whether we could quite rapidly develop research activities within a Euro-Mediterranean context, since you recently had a meeting at Capri with the Research Ministers of countries from both sides of the Mediterranean, and because this is an issue of great concern to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mrs Plooij van Gorsel, thank you for your intervention. I am aware of the significant support that your report gives to the European Research Area. I feel that we must take into due consideration the fact that our objective is not part of a traditional framework programme. You, who have experience, will perhaps say that this has already been stated several times.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that what is currently required is something that structures the European Research Area, which is to say something that goes beyond the framework programme and supplements national programmes; we need a structuring element, which means that we have to agree on<span class="bold"> </span>certain rules. And here I am referring to the flip side of variable geometry. Yes, with an opening-up of the national programmes of several Member States onto an area with European added value, the Commission and the Union can intervene. But they must intervene by applying criteria that facilitate access which is as broad as possible for all the elements of the European Union, which is to say for all the Member States, and even for third countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">There are new proposals to champion. We have never made use of Article 169 of the Treaty; this Article could be used to harness more frequently and more cohesively the activities of the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your views on multidisciplinarity. This issue is certainly not developed particularly extensively, but it is nevertheless brought to light in the criteria. The third paragraph of page 9 of the document reads as follows: “need to combine complementary expertise in the different countries, particularly in the case of interdisciplinary issues, and to carry out comparative studies on a European scale”.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that in the future – and you have stressed this in your report – development will take place on the borderlines between different technologies and sciences such as biology and information technology. It is therefore clear that the multidisciplinary aspect must be taken into consideration, and will moreover constitute one of the elements of European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the question about the European Union and its disinterested approach to basic research, I do not feel that this is the case. I moreover believe that this dichotomy between basic research and applied research is a thing of the past. In many fields, it is immediately apparent that certain basic research elements are, in fact, applied research elements. The current framework programmes are therefore a mixture of basic research issues and applied research issues. So I do not feel that there is any need to make a distinction. This is my belief, and also that of the scientific community, which does not seem to be of the opinion that that European Union programmes systematically disregard basic research. I believe that we will have the opportunity, Mr Papayannakis, to address this issue again in our discussions, but there is no intention on our part to make a distinction. Moreover, no one is talking about making a distinction, and industry has not called for one.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to reply to Mr Piétrasanta, who I thank for his intervention and constructive intent. As concerns discussions with the STOA Unit, I feel that we have to act together, since this is something that concerns this House, the Joint Research Centre and the technological foresight institutes in the various Member States. It is in our own interests to cooperate more effectively and more closely. I would therefore welcome any form of debate or discussion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the Euro-Mediterranean context more specifically, I believe that you too will have noted the interest shown by the countries on both sides of the Mediterranean in conducting joint research and technological development activities. I would, however, like to say before Parliament that it is important for this need, which has been expressed and which is, moreover, a force for economic development and innovation in this area, to be considered at the level of the MEDA programmes and at that of all the external relations programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is often a tendency, at external relations level, not to view research and technological development as priorities. I, for my part, believe that these are key factors for increasing understanding among researchers and their mobility around the Mediterranean basin. In any case, these were the conclusions that the Ministers for Research and Science reached on this subject at Capri last weekend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are two points that I would like Mr Busquin to explore a bit further with us this afternoon. The first is that he specifically mentioned in his statement EU participation in national programmes. Could he expand a little on what he envisages and say whether that will entail the EU partly funding national programmes and acting as a coordinator or will the JRC become one of the actors in a broader research network on an equal basis, for example, with other national research teams.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to press Mr Busquin on a point that Mr Piétrasanta made, because I do not think he answered that and it was a point that I certainly supported. Can he confirm that he will be considering some pilot programmes in 2000-2001 in order to develop some of the networking concepts ahead of full implementation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thirdly, the ECSC Treaty will be expiring in 2002. At that point considerable funds will be available for coal and steel research.

The Commission appears to be moving quickly towards shaping the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions: firstly, the term ‘added value’ that you used, although this is not the first time it has been used, refers to economic criteria for the development of research and may lead to the commercialisation of research. Without wishing to pour scorn on the commercial and practical side of the use made of the results of research, I am somewhat concerned that this will become the prime criterion. Could you possibly allay my concern?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question relates to the centres of excellence. Does the Commission have any criteria in mind for choosing these centres of excellence? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will see in the policy paper, discussions are already underway on two or three issues, which will be put into effect as of next year, bearing in mind, of course, the constraints associated with legal aspects of the Fifth Framework Programme. A degree of flexibility can, however, be shown in respect of certain issues. You will have three examples of this in the policy paper, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss this matter again soon.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question that you refer to, you have spoken of participation in national programmes. I believe that this will be one of the key issues. If I am unable to give you an immediate reply on this today, it is because it was precisely my intention, in this policy paper, to invite the Member States to adopt a position, for there will never be a European Research Area if it stems solely from the will of the Commission. The Commission and the framework programme only account for 5% of research-related public expenditure. There can therefore be no talk of a European Research Area if we are only responsible for 5% of that research.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that on the 16th, at the meeting of the Ministers responsible for science, the Member States undertake to open up their national programmes. At that juncture, the contribution that we can make will consist of providing some sort of coordination. The States who agree to open up their programmes will foster coordination and mobility within a relationship yet to be defined – on a project by project basis, of course. Not all the projects will be opened up; some will be easier than others to integrate at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Lange, I would like to say that we are already beginning to take management measures. There is Mr Gerold’s report, certain elements of which I am still waiting to receive, but I can tell you now that, as it says in the policy paper, there is a need to increase the size of projects. We currently find ourselves somewhat overwhelmed by a host of projects that are too small, which make administration cumbersome, and which exacerbate constraints and lead to errors.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to social and economic research, it is quite clear that there is a place for this. There will be an entire chapter on science, society and the citizens. We are going to draft a Communication on this subject. I indeed feel that, in Europe, research and development must be conducted with the citizens. There is a whole series of avenues that must be explored in the field of social and economic research, in the fields of foodstuffs, new technologies and, in particular, biotechnologies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ECSC programme, you will be aware that an agreement has been reached, and that research will continue. It will not, until there is a proven need to the contrary, be totally incorporated into the framework programmes. It will retain its specific character. This, moreover, is the wish of those who negotiated the ECSC research programmes with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Alyssandrakis, I feel that commercial issues should not be allowed to predominate. In any case, the type of research that could be labelled ‘disinterested’, which is to say research that has no commercial goal, is often the type of research that produces the best results in economic and basic terms. I believe that everyone now realises the need to maintain an area which guarantees freedom of development to researchers, independently of purely commercial imperatives. Your question is very relevant, but we will have to wait to see what happens in practice. We do not intend to push commercial issues to the fore in all fields of research. Much targeted research has a highly prominent commercial aspect, but there are also more basic forms of research which serve general European Union policies and, at times, also have beneficial spin-offs for commercial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards centres of excellence, we are at precisely the point of preparing the applicable criteria. I would nonetheless like to emphasise one sentence which you will see in the policy paper that I feel to be very important, because the issue of centres of excellence has prompted many questions. It is inadvisable to define what exactly is excellent and what is not. We therefore feel that we should refer to the terms as they stand in the policy paper, namely the ‘networking of capabilities for excellence in the public sector (in particular university teams) and private-sector centres of excellence, which would be achieved with long-term joint programmes of activities’. This is therefore a bottom-up operation to be carried out not with hyper-centres, but with different teams working as part of a network. High-performance European- and international-level teams which link up to work as a network, regardless of where they are based. The information technologies now available make this quite possible, whatever the size of the teams. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
