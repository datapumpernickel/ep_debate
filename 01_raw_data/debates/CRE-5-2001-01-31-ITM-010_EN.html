<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wieland (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs McNally said earlier, her report was not a particularly sexy matter. I think reports grow less sexy the later it gets, but I do not want to offend Mr Ferri, whose turn it is next.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft directive amends and supplements a total of 10 directives, some of which date back to 1977. The President has saved me some time by already enumerating the professions concerned. Why did this report require so much care, including a time- and energy-consuming Conciliation Procedure, even though many may perhaps say the honourable Members are acting as though the world is being turned upside down, when it is basically just a matter of detail? Why did the vast majority of us insist on this Conciliation Procedure? There are essentially three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, apart from architects and, in some respects, veterinary surgeons, they are all health-care professions in the widest sense. In everyday life, you can seek restitution for loss or damage suffered, but a human being is not a Golf, a Skoda or a Citroën that you can take to a professional or even an amateur mechanic to tinker about with. In such cases you can make a claim to make good the loss. But when it comes to health, the damage cannot normally be made good. That is why we have compensation for pain and suffering. From my own practice as a lawyer, I know of no one who would not gladly have repaid such compensation if the damage to his health could in that way have been reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may digress slightly, I think the whole procedure is a good example of why the Council ought in future to meet in public. From Greece to Ireland and from Italy to Finland, our citizens would have been very interested in much of what was said there and would have thought, “What are our governments proposing here? We want better safeguards!” There is therefore a lot of interest in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this brings me to my second concern, we have the internal market. Wherever a diploma has been obtained, we want it to be used in the context of the free movement of people and services. Of course, the Member State on the other side and the citizen is interested first of all in asking anyone who wants to pack his bags and go to another Member State straight after his exams about the training he has received. Likewise, if somebody decides to go to another Member State 10 or even 30 years after taking his exams, the citizens and the host Member States want to know what the person has been doing in the last years since his exams. Has he undertaken further training? Has he kept himself abreast of developments?</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my third reason. Parliament is keen that we should produce readable texts. I have already mentioned that I am a lawyer. When I was reading up on this matter, I have to say it was like going from one disaster to another. What we produce here is basically rubbish so far as the interested public is concerned. We must produce consolidated texts more quickly in future. For these various reasons, Parliament accepted 11 amendments with a large majority, and my only regret on going to conciliation was that I did not ask for that majority to be checked, because that would have shown that well over 400 of us were in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore also thank Mrs Gebhardt, with whom I worked closely to achieve that large majority, and who had confidence even though the conciliation delegation had three EVP members, that being how things turned out by the rules of the House. I will not bore you with the details – deadlines for transposition, the matter of qualifications obtained in third countries, replacement of the word “similar” by the word “equivalent” and the conclusion of Italian pharmacist studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, three more basic principles. Firstly, the Commission has said that it will produce consolidated texts in future. I can only urge all rapporteurs to call for this soon to be done in their own fields, too. Secondly, lifelong learning. We must not just keep on talking about it, we must make it a requirement. I believe we have reached a good compromise. For reasons of subsidiarity, we have not produced any legislation, but we had our way with the preamble. Thirdly and lastly, the specialised training course for general practitioners was extended to three years. France was persuaded to increase it from two and a half to three years, while we have conceded to Member States Belgium and Finland that this special type can also be accepted with a longer basic training.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore say that conciliation produced a good outcome, and I would ask you to vote in favour. But I should also like to say that we very much regret that the Commission was unfortunately not on our side from the outset on the points we were calling for and on which the Council finally gave way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Wieland possesses both qualities in good measure. With him as rapporteur, it was therefore almost a pleasure for myself and my colleagues to work towards the outcome that is now before us. We can be slightly proud of that. We have managed for the first time to get something that is normally only talked about enshrined in European law. I mean the necessity for lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of medicine, we shall in future not only have rules and criteria for the recognition of diplomas, examination certificates and other attestations of competence. We are now saying for the first time that passing the final professional examination is not enough, but that training must continue, in the interests of patients in particular, but also in the interests of doctors and nursing staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the very rapid pace of technological and scientific progress in medicine, lifelong learning in one’s chosen profession is particularly important. But we must not be content that it now appears in this recognition directive. Rather, our legislation should be a contribution to making this initial success and with it lifelong learning into one of the mainstays of working life for everyone in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention another point that has always concerned me in connection with the recognition of professional qualifications. I will dress it up in a question that has still not been answered by this directive: why are we so reluctant to recognise qualifications obtained outside the European Union? This question troubles me when I see how markets are becoming globalised and how easily we allow capital to move around. Our citizens are able to bring goods and money with them from every corner of the world, but very personal assets in the form of professional knowledge and skills are not freely transferable. There is something wrong there. We must put it right quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commission to abandon two arguments when preparing future recognition directives. First, that it affects only a small number of EU citizens. Second, that the Treaty provides only a limited basis in law. Things will go a lot better then, you will see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, the areas that we are talking about in this present raft of recognition of qualifications, are areas where we have experienced huge shortages within the EU in the recent past. Also there have been cases highlighted where barriers were put in place and people who wanted to move from one Member State to the other could not have the qualifications recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the important issues raised within the discussions at conciliation and also within the report itself is in clearing up some of the wording used. In particular there is the question of replacing the word “similar” with the word “equivalent”. I am presently dealing with a case in Ireland where someone who has trained as a physiotherapist in one Member State cannot get their qualification recognised in Ireland because of the formal academic aspect even though in every other country in the European Union work experience is recognised as the equivalent of the academic qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, there is also a necessity for us to make sure, once the legislation is passed at a European level, that the Member States strictly enforce the legislation and open up the opportunities that are available. Too often we have seen hidden barriers put in place to prevent people from one profession or another moving to a country to operate. If we are truly to bring about the idea of the single market, and if we are truly to live up to the principles of the freedom of movement of persons, than we must dismantle these barriers, which we can see are not so much at a European Union institution level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain individual professions. We need rigorous enforcement of all legislation so any complaints can be dealt with quickly.</p>
