I am also grateful to the Council and to the Austrian Presidency, which have taken note of the views of Parliament and given priority to the regulation of medicinal products for paediatric use. Finally, Commissioner, I should like to thank your staff for their technical input and recommendations. I was extremely pleased to work with them. Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we shall be able to approve on second reading a regulation of vital importance for health in Europe. We were unanimous as to the goal, and our discussions enabled us to reach agreement on the operational aspects of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems inconceivable that, in 2006, our children do not have treatment tailored to their needs. However, this is the situation we have. Today, numerous medicinal products administered to children have not been developed specifically for them. Frequently, products used for the youngest children are the same as those prescribed for adults, with only the dose reduced – and with consequences that are sometimes catastrophic. A child’s metabolism is different from that of an adult. Children therefore need specific pharmaceutical forms, not only for better tolerance but also for greater effectiveness and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Regulation creates all the conditions for the development of paediatric medicines, notably by supporting innovation and research and by creating incentives for pharmaceutical laboratories, while at the same time requiring them to develop a paediatric form for every new drug and to make it available in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On a large number of points, the Council had already followed Parliament’s recommendations at first reading. I am thinking particularly of the system of incentives which extends by six months the Protection Certificate for all new paediatric indications. The Council had also accepted on first reading Parliament's request to avoid additional clinical trials being carried out on children where not absolutely necessary. On the eve of the second reading, only a few differences of opinion remained. A common position had to be found on technical details.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reached an agreement between the three institutions, largely through application of the 'better regulation' principle. I am thinking in particular of the question of the independence of members of the Paediatric Committee and the issue of pharmacovigilance. Earlier legislation already included robust measures on these points. It is therefore more appropriate to refer to that legislation rather than create an accumulation of rules. This agreement was also helped by the Commission's response to our demands concerning the use of potentially dangerous substances in the outer covering of the medicinal product. We welcome the official declaration submitted to us and now, of course, await concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further point to which I should like to draw the Commission’s attention, namely the question of the period of time between the issue of a marketing authorisation and the availability of the medicinal product to patients. A directive exists on transparency, which establishes the deadlines for setting the price and for the reimbursement for medicines. The timing differences between Member States are too great. This is a situation which has negative consequences for patients. I have discussed this point with colleagues in all parliamentary groups and we should like to ask you what can be done to reduce these disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission’s initial proposal states that all requests for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate resulting from a new paediatric indication must be lodged no later than two years prior to expiry of the certificate. I support that approach, but, above all, we must be pragmatic. By adopting this measure as it stands, we would stand the risk of depriving ourselves of medicinal products which, when this law entered into force, happened to be in this two-year period. Under the terms of this article, it would be impossible to conduct research in order to develop a paediatric indication.</p>
<p class="contents">The transitional clause we are proposing, with the agreement of a majority of my colleagues, is intended to remedy this undesired effect. We are therefore requesting that, for five years, any application for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate as a result of a new paediatric indication may be lodged no later than six months before expiry of the certificate. After this period, the Commission’s initial proposal will apply. We should be grateful for your agreement on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this text provides the opportunity to match words with actions in supporting European research; that is what we shall do tomorrow. A great debate is currently in progress to find the best way of promoting Europe to our fellow citizens. Europeans are not interested in grandiose rhetoric – they expect action. This regulation on paediatric medication is a concrete response to that expectation. This text is a good example of the added value of Europe in everyday life, as no Member State acting on its own would be able to promote such a policy on behalf of all children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank the members of the committee for supporting this proposal. I would also like to emphasise the committed work of the Austrian Presidency in connection with this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the constructive cooperation between the three institutions we now have the opportunity to bring this legislative procedure to a close. We must be reticent about making new laws, but this proposal is necessary. In the European Union today, more than half of the medicinal products given to children have never been tested for this usage. The reason for this is that paediatric medicinal products frequently only have a tiny share of the market and clinical testing can be very expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice this means that a doctor who prescribes a medicinal product for a child does not always know if it works at all or whether it could have any side effects. With the new Regulation this problem will be solved in the interests of children. It creates incentives for first-class research in this field and promotes the development and licensing of high-quality, effective medicines for children.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise two items which were raised in this Parliament’s discussion. Firstly, the influence of the so-called Transparency Directive and, secondly, the treatment of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament was quite right to point out the significance of the Transparency Directive. I agree with you wholeheartedly that the decisions of national authorities on the price of paediatric medicinal products and on the reimbursement of costs in connection with these must not lead to the availability of these products being delayed. Decisions about pricing policies and reimbursement of costs are the responsibilities of the Member States. However, the Commission cannot accept any deviation from the procedural rules laid down in the Transparency Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore intensified our efforts to scrutinise more thoroughly the proper execution of the Directive in all Member States and to ensure that it is more effectively enforced. Furthermore, I have established the Pharmaceutical Forum together with my colleague Mr Kyprianou. Working in partnership with Member States and concerned groups, this framework is intended to provide solutions to urgent questions relating to the medicinal products sector, including among other things aspects of price and reimbursement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has also raised the important question of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. I share your judgment that we must be extremely careful in dealing with such dangerous substances in all areas. Nevertheless I believe that the amendments – which, together with this Regulation, aim at prohibiting the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products in general – are problematic for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: the regulation on paediatric medicinal products can only regulate the auxiliary agents in medicines for children. However, the rules governing auxiliary agents should be identical for all medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot rule out the possibility that – precisely for certain important medicinal products – such auxiliary agents are indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that a further thorough scientific analysis of these issues is necessary, before we decide on possible measures. The Commission therefore plans to ask the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for an opinion on the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products for human use. This opinion will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council. Within six months of the delivery of the opinion, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the measures that it plans to put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given a declaration to this effect to the Secretariat of the European Parliament so that the wording can be published and made accessible to all Members<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, allow me to stress that this regulation is a good example of better lawmaking, one that does equal justice to the aims of safeguarding public health and promoting innovation. This is one of the Commission’s first legislative proposals that is based on a detailed impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will improve health protection for our children and it will simultaneously promote innovation and competitiveness in the European medicinal products industry. I am grateful for your support of this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the culmination of a process which has, in my view, lasted six years. Six years ago we discussed the problem and possible solutions with experts in Strasbourg for the first time, and now we are at the end of the legislative procedure. I wish to thank the Commissioner and all those who have worked on this project, in particular however Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who contributed a great deal and who unfortunately cannot be here today. I wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal contributes to the solution of a serious problem. I myself have worked as a doctor in a children’s clinic and I have found out what a drama it is for children, parents and doctors when many forms of medication necessary for the treatment of children are prohibited. I myself have had problems, but not as many problems as other colleagues and other families. In some of these families children have died, because medicinal products that lacked authorisation were not administered or because, for example, children suffering from HIV were given too weak a dosage, which caused the children to become resistant to the medication.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so good that we now have this regulation. I particularly welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission have taken up the proposal to impose the MICE programme on off-patent medicines. At first reading I was not completely satisfied with the uniform period of six months. Even so, it is vital to make a start, and if we see that the six months are not appropriate for all cases, then perhaps we shall have to make further amendments. Now we just have to act quickly, and so I am very glad that Mrs Grossetête has persuaded the Council and the Commission to adopt Article 18. For if we had not managed this, then the first medicines would only have come onto the market on the basis of the incentive system in 2009 at the earliest. Now we shall be able to recognise positive effects immediately after the regulation is adopted, and that is important, because we have to act quickly in order to improve children’s health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important topic we are discussing this evening. Children take medicinal products; lots of them, relatively speaking. That is why it is so important that children are administered the right medicinal products, in the right dose and in the right form of administration. The Commission’s proposal is of major significance to children, parents and industry alike. That is why I find it so regrettable that today, Mrs Roth-Behrendt is unable to be present, for she went all-out for this legislation, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that our group was very divided on this proposal. Of course, everyone is agreed that medicinal products for paediatric use must be developed and that their manufacturers must be given reasonable compensation for research they carry out into them. This compensation could even be substantial, but for many of our group, the extension of the patent by another six months went a little too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Enquiries I made at a renowned enterprise revealed that, in most cases, research into the use of medicinal products for paediatric use costs no less than EUR 8 million. When patents are extended by six months, profits increase into a multiple of this sum, namely to some EUR 200 to 300 million, which are hefty profits. Blockbusters command even higher amounts. It is, of course, also possible that the profits are a little lower in the case of medicinal products for rare diseases. That is why we have argued in favour of proportionality. We think that the reward should be in proportion to the costs incurred. That is a very simple and normal principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The bill for medicinal products need not become unnecessarily steep and that is why – and that is also my final comment – we are looking forward with eager anticipation to the assessment and review of this directive, which will then make evident what the six months’ of patent extension have yielded, what the economic costs are and whether it causes detriment to the industry’s innovative strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation on the security of children’s medical products is a great success for patients in Europe. It is long overdue, and now it is important that it enter into force quickly. This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this helpful compromise, which makes an agreement with the Council at second reading possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had lengthy and extensive debates in this House on the renewal of patents for research-conducting producers of medicines, and sometimes there was haggling over each individual month of renewal. Many colleagues have been quite upset about the possibility of additional profits for the pharmaceutical industry. This unspeakable debate is now finally over. This is, after all, about the security of medical products for children, which must be guaranteed. If the research-conducting producers of medicines require an additional incentive in order to develop their products, then they should get it. Finally, economic logic requires it too.</p>
<p class="contents">If this incentive has the additional effect of strengthening European research and attracting research-conducting pharmaceutical businesses back to Europe, then this is positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête for the excellent work she has done on this regulation. It is apparent that she has put in a great deal of effort, commitment and skill.</p>
<p class="contents">Health, and particularly children’s health, is a priority in itself. When raising a sensitive issue such as medication for children, however, we should ask ourselves an honest question, namely whether it is possible to claim beyond doubt that prescribing adult medication to children is more ethical than involving children in controlled studies that are subject to stringent legislative provisions. This is a question we should all ask ourselves, and which should form the basis for further discussion. Unfortunately, we do not have much time for this at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regards to the regulation, however, I am definitely opposed to reducing the period during which a company can apply to extend sole marketing authorisation for the basic product from two years to six months. This proposal was voted on at first reading, when only 1% of votes cast in Parliament were in favour of it. The amendment was supported neither by the Council, nor by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my regret that due to lack of support during the vote in May, no amendments were adopted to prevent abuse of the system of remuneration and incentives that are permissible under the provisions of the regulation under discussion. I am keen that companies should not accumulate preferential instruments and remuneration for conducting the same studies for the same product, which would lead to abuse on too many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do believe that it is important that producers of medicinal products be reimbursed for the costs incurred when carrying out trials of the use of medicines in children. Such compensation could take the form of patenting new means of administering medication or forms of a medicinal substance and of giving sole marketing rights for medicinal products for children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important here to stress that medicinal products used in adults should only be subject to investigation for their use in children where this is reasonable and necessary. Finally, I would like to express my full support for the establishment of a Paediatrics Research Committee made up of members with specialist knowledge and competence, and who are independent experts in their fields. I believe this to be a very positive solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources – I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries – or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved. That is why we now have to legislate on the question of medicinal products for paediatric use.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that this report will be adopted tomorrow, as we all want children to have medication appropriate to their age and medical condition without delay. Having said that, I regret – and Mrs Grossetête has also pointed this out – that the two-year period for marketing a medicinal product has been maintained, and, moreover, I regret that the amendment intended to cut that period has not been supported. I also regret the long delay in obtaining an inventory of needs for paediatric treatments. These delays belie the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">We should, however, not lose sight of the ethical side of the matter, and must prevent children from being used as guinea pigs. That is why it is good that double testing is being cut out by the possibility of research already being done in third countries being valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Since estimates show that 50 to 90% of the medicinal products that are currently being used in paediatrics are never specifically studied or approved for use in that age category, the negative and positive effects of their application are virtually unknown.
