<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we used to learn at school: ‘Mens sana in corpore sano’ – a healthy mind in a healthy body, and we are, in theory, all acquainted with this wisdom from ancient Rome. Of all leisure activities, sport is the most widespread, with one out of every three Europeans participating in some form of it, some of them, indeed, continuing to do so well into old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Physical activity promotes health, and competition in sport develops a range of social skills, such as friendship, team spirit, solidarity, commitment, perseverance and, last but not least, fair play. As you will all be aware, you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins, but a great one by the way he loses.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite sport's essential social role, ladies and gentlemen, there is no policy on it at Community level. We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already, for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties. We can therefore unreservedly welcome the way the Commissioner has at last responded to the aspiration expressed in my last report on sport, produced as long ago as 1996, and proclaimed a year of sport. It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport, but, for many understandable reasons, the ‘Year of Education through Sport 2004’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is about using a large number of projects to highlight sport's role in informal learning and its educational value, and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in Europe. To come to the point, the objective and rationale of the ‘European Year of Education through Sport 2004’ is not to show what people are capable of in the sporting arena – something that we can demonstrate to ourselves to our own satisfaction every day of the year on dozens of television channels – but to show what sport can do in human terms and for people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is consensus in this House as regards the Year's seven objectives. It is to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sporting organisations, the development of social skills through sport, voluntary activity, pupils' mobility by means of international competitions, a balance between mental and physical activity, as well as consideration of how the educational needs of young sportsmen and women are to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage. What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved, the EUR 11.5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do. If everyone now plays their part – and that includes the media – then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport. I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round. By means of this Year, we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects. Research is always in progress, and that is not what this Year is for. I believe that the only research we need is to ask ourselves, when it is all over, ‘what has this Year achieved?’ but otherwise not to spend money on it. The Council shares our view on this. It has also accepted my idea of organising a European competition in the run-up to the Olympic Games – incorporating it, not into the Treaty, but into a protocol. I am very happy about this, and I very much hope that the Commission will respond to our concern by announcing a competition culminating in its victors being allowed to be present at the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia in 2004. That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">What, ladies and gentlemen, is all this about? It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers, institutions of state education and organisations. We want to kick-start cross-border initiatives and networks, and we have to set up an ideas exchange, enabling exemplary projects and initiatives – that is to say best practices – to be followed by as many as possible during the preparations in 2003 and the actual Year in 2004. The Community projects instrument will receive 80% support, and those things done at national level alone will receive 50% co-financing. This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year's European dimension centre-stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I will leave it at that, but would like to thank the Council and the Commission and express the hope that we will all be able to take the idea of this Year of Education through Sport back to our communities, and that, eventually, the Convention will be astute enough to give sport a legal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would even go so far as to say that it is almost a historic moment for the young people of our countries. Indeed, you are about to adopt the decision to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport. This is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport, particularly one focusing on its educational value.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens, showing them that the Community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education. It was right that the recognition of this value should take place in the European Parliament, for it is the European Parliament which has been calling for years for more focus on sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the European Year, resources, good intentions and imagination will be mobilised throughout an entire year to promote a policy, to promote an approach, to enable civil society to participate. I am sure that a European Year of Education through Sport can make a decisive contribution to the promotion of the ideals we share, the ideal of sport as having an educational role and as a means of imparting values.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, therefore, the decision that you are about to adopt with your vote is good news for the worlds of education and sport. It is also the formalisation of the astute work carried out together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Our spirit of partnership, our faultless cooperation and our consensus on the text mean that, today, if this were an Olympic competition, we would have to share the gold medal. All this means that everything is now in order and we can therefore move on and start the practical work, for the discussions have progressed quickly and well. There has been no need for red cards to be given out, to use a football metaphor, which is clear evidence that our joint effort has been carried out in a spirit of sincere friendship. Moreover, the European Parliament has played its part fully: our original text has been amended and altered and the result – I am not ashamed to admit – is an improvement on the Commission’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you emphasised the need to carry through practical measures relating to basic sport. You placed the emphasis on projects in the field rather than on reports and studies. You highlighted the need for a partnership between sports organisations and education organisations. Lastly, you clarified the objectives of our Year of Education through Sport and you pointed out the need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences. All these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision. At its last meetings, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deemed that the Council’s common position gave due consideration to Parliament’s main concerns, and I believe that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noticed, during my travels throughout Europe and my conversations and meetings how popular this new initiative is already and how high the expectations are of our citizens, in our schools, in sports organisations and public authorities. I am therefore quite convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that this European Year of Education through Sport will be a great Year. If, by way of example, we consider the European Year of Languages and the way it developed through the contributions of the citizens, I am sure that, run along the same lines, the European Year of Sport will be even more effective and have an even greater effect on our different societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Some days ago, in Vienna, at a conference on the subject of Europe and ethics, President Prodi said: ‘Europe … needs ideas and a soul’. Our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about. I am delighted to say that education and sport are at the centre of everyone’s daily concerns. The only thing we have to do, and we will succeed in this, is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">On a practical level, I can now tell you that my staff have already been working on the calls for proposals which need to be launched in the coming months. We are already thinking about a schedule, events and setting up an advisory committee. I must admit that, as you can see, this vote is not the final whistle marking the end of an impeccably played political game. Rather, it is the starting pistol. Of course, Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress made on the European Year. The Commission does, of course, have a formal obligation to keep Parliament informed, but this will also give me the opportunity to hear your ideas, for you have made such a useful contribution to the initial development of the idea of the Year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I spoke just now of the historic vote on education through sport. The year 2004, as everyone knows, will be a historic year in many other respects too: enlargement, then the Convention and many other major events. In this connection, I would like to ask you to reflect on the following questions. In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens, can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity? Should we not take notice of the fact that sport has pride of place in the citizens’ daily lives? Is sport not an important part of any citizenship policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know that Parliament has started to discuss these questions and that you are already aware of the role played by sport in European integration and in awakening a European spirit in our fellow citizens. In a similar way, the sporting values that we are going to promote vigorously among the younger generations and citizens of Europe will be the basis for active citizenship in which there is respect for others and respect for the European ideal.</p>

Both in normal situations and in extreme situations, in marginalized areas, when there is a need for integration, amongst many others. Furthermore, it is a great tool for educating on issues such as the environment, food, health, teamwork etc. We should take the greatest possible advantage of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take advantage of the fact that 2004 is the European Year of Education through Sport in order to demonstrate to the Europeans that we in the European Union are also concerned about sport and that we attach much importance, for example – since I do not want to give an interminable list – on the benefits which it brings for health, for the integration of people in our Europe and for the fight against xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take advantage of the possible impact of 2004 to demonstrate that it is entirely compatible to work for sport in the 15 Member States – or 25, when enlargement takes place – and also at Community level, at the same time, and that they must not fear that we are going to take over their competences. What we do want is to fill the vacuum left by subsidiarity so that the Europeans can benefit from the numerous positive aspects of sport. I therefore ask that we all make an additional effort so that, in the next review of the Treaty on European Union, an article relating to sport may be included, once and for all, so that the Europeans may see that here, in the European Parliament, in the European Commission and in all the European institutions, we care about sport as an essential tool for improving their quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see it as a good start that we are able, today, to discuss it during the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that 2004 will be so fully devoted to sport. The Olympic Games, the Paralympics, the European Cup in football, to name but a few, will draw the attention of millions of people, filling many of them with enthusiasm, disappointing others, but also prompting people to themselves get involved or step up their involvement. The European Year of Education through Sport can make use of this public interest in order to highlight the social value of sport. There is already evidence, provided by numerous studies, of sport's educational value, of its capacity for preventing ill-health and rehabilitating after illness, of the social skills that it imparts to young people and the elderly, and of much else that has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the fact that we will be producing no more new studies, but will be gathering new insights from practical experience of the Year of Sport's extension of activities such as the encouragement of cooperation between schools and sporting organisations. That is of great importance in bringing the two together and maximising the advantages to both in terms of the mobility of pupils, clubs and officials, and also supporting sport in performing its social functions and discharging its social obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, however, it all keeps coming back to the importance of asking what we mean by fair play, which is inseparable from sport. I believe that racism, doping, and the treatment of sportswomen and sportsmen as commodities have left deep scars on the image of fair play. In the same way, we should be treating women in sport with a new respect, and doing something about their status in this area too. That is also underlined by our call for clubs to be involved in the Year of Education through Sport – something not called for in the first proposals. There are 600 000 sports clubs, with thousands of officials, and they make a very important and essential educational contribution that we can never dispense with.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 2003, the Year of People with Disabilities, is almost upon us. I believe that here too we have to make use of this issue as an early preparation for 2004, asking even now how many opportunities disabled sportswomen and sportsmen have to integrate? What activities can the sports clubs – all 600 000 and more of them – offer these people? This is where there is a need for public awareness and also for financial support. All this underscores our demand for this to be incorporated into the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has been pressing us for a European year of sport in previous resolutions, the last of which was in 1997. Up to now, the European Union has primarily paid attention to professional sport and much less to recreational sport and its cultural, educational and social merits. As has rightly been said, this is probably and primarily due to the fact that the Treaty still contains no articles giving the European Union explicit powers in this area. Yet in view of the fact that a third of EU citizens actively participate in sports and that there are more than 600 000 sports clubs, sport is undeniably an important social phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is not only important on a social and cultural level but on a financial one as well. According to estimates, the sector accounts for about 2% of the European Union’s total gross domestic product. Sport is of great significance as a disseminator of positive values such as willpower, courage, tolerance, loyalty and friendship. In view of its enormous impact, however, sport is also often approached negatively with feelings of chauvinism, racism and violence, and it unfortunately also gets negative publicity as a result of violence, corruption or hooliganism. In this European Year the spotlight will be on sports education and training for young people, and this is therefore something to be celebrated. It is also true to say that less and less time and attention is devoted to sports education at school, a trend that urgently needs to be reversed. This is where sports clubs can play a complementary, supporting role for schools. It is therefore essential to improve links between clubs and schools. Sport should primarily be creating a physical and mental balance as well as social integration, and, as we are heading for enlargement in 2004, this is more than important, particularly at a time when intolerance is increasingly raising its ugly head. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from being an important social phenomenon and a way to improve psychological and physical health, sport is also an excellent educational instrument which helps young people acquire important social skills. That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme. It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities. Nevertheless, I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament's amendments providing for the organisation of school competitions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece. That said, however, I welcome the Council's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers’ funds on sporting activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the construction of Europe, the role of sport was formally recognised by the Communities in the Adonino report presented to the Milan European Council in June 1985. There can be no question that this issue was seen as a major asset, enabling the Communities to foster active engagement of the citizens of Europe in the construction of that project. Therefore, whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House, the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration. In other words, this is naked propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games. Members of this House may think otherwise, but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers’ money is to be spent on this project. The sum of EUR 11.5 million may be a small amount in the grander scheme of things, but it is still a lot of money. There is no justification. We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our dear friends, Mrs Zabell, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström and Mr Mennea, are in some way an example, evidence of the simple fact that educating people through sport means producing a generation which knows the value of things as well as the price. Precisely because it understands their value, it is able to display a great passion for social values when it matures, displaying a strength and commitment which are not limited to the quest for results at all costs, and that is why these Members are fully entitled to sit in this Chamber and are worthy representatives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our intention is to convey this concept and these values in a debate which embraces the education systems too. At the moment, if there is any severe criticism in our report, it is criticism of the European education systems, which are devoting increasingly less time to the playing of sport in schools and under which there are an ever-increasing number of schools with dilapidated sports facilities. These must receive support and assistance. This is one reason for the rapporteur’s concern to approach the matter in a practical way, promoting a practical debate on the educational potential of sport through the staging of the competitions. In other words, I believe that the European Year of Education through Sport may be the right stimulus to get schools to do something for the European youth of tomorrow, to change the fate of a generation, so that, in the future, we have different young people who not only become champions but, more importantly, become people who see sport as a path to truth, in other words who become champions of humanity, for a champion of humanity can become a sporting champion too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education. It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that the Commission should have begun to organise a Year of Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe. Leaving aside for a moment the benefits of having a regular, wide-ranging hobby and an attitude to life that goes with it, even a little exercise prevents heart and vascular diseases, ailments that affect the organs of locomotion, rheumatic illnesses and mental health problems. The very fact that exercise is able to prevent mental problems often gets little attention. Exercise can help keep a nation’s major economic problems in check. An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen in this light, the budget of EUR 11.5 million granted for the Year is at least not oversized. Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished. Resources to make these afternoon activities possible must be increased considerably, as there is a huge demand for what they can provide. Afternoon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work. Afternoon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise. At the same time, they are doing something meaningful and social problems and exclusion are being prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Why can we not talk of sport as sport? It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles, as there is not one for sport. It is better to call things by their own name, both now and in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to add my congratulations to those of all the Members who have highlighted Mrs Pack’s remarkable work and her vigorous, tenacious endeavours over many years, which have, at last, brought success. Today one might say, her baby is being taken to church to be baptised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it has not been possible to include in the text Parliament’s suggestion that schools competitions could be staged and that winners could be present at the ceremony of the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, I can let you into a secret. My co-workers are already working with the International School Sport Federation to see what can be done to accommodate Parliament’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware, Mr President, that Parliament does not want an avalanche of studies on the matter. That is all well and good, provided that it does not turn round afterwards and say that studies would have been useful after all. While I acknowledge the need for practical work, I still feel that it is necessary for an evaluation to be carried out afterwards, as, moreover, happened in the case of the European Year of Languages, which was such a success that I feel we can use it as a model in terms of what to do and what not to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I can let you into another secret. I have already received numerous requests from the major European sports federations, who want to contribute to or participate in the project or to work with us. They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise. They will not ask us for money, for they have much more money than we have! The EUR 11.5 million budget is intended to encourage, to set in motion a driving force, for it is civil society, sportspeople and schools which will actually do the practical work.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions have been asked relating to the European Year of People with Disabilities, on which we are actively working. The Special World Olympics will take place in summer 2003 in Dublin. In this context, we will fund the hiring of Irish volunteers to make this major sporting festival for people with disabilities possible. This is an experiment which will be repeated throughout 2003 and 2004: getting young volunteers – 100, 200, 300 volunteers – from all the countries of Europe to work together in the service of sport during major events of great symbolic importance. The first experiment, in Dublin, will thus bring together 200 volunteers from all over Europe. This will be repeated in Athens for both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, and for all the major sporting events where the voluntary contributions, good will and idealism of our young people can come into their own. In other words, our young people will take centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">You can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken. As I promised you, you will be kept informed of developments, and I am also counting on your contribution so that we can make this year the year of all the citizens in your regions and your countries, for, as representatives of the citizens, you have a major role to play in this sense.</p>
