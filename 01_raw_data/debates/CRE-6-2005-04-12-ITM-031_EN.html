<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pittella (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span><span class="bold"></span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Council representative, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the 2006 budget has numerous peculiarities.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it is a bridging budget; while we approve the general principles – at least I hope we do – the debate on the financial perspectives is approaching its final hurdle.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to take a decision on how much, what and how – in other words to decide whether to resign ourselves to a pared-down, impotent Europe or to fight together so that financial rigour can be combined with adequate resources for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The key exists, but we have to know how to use it with courage. The key is the quality of spending, which must be focused on high-value-added sectors and common policies with a European logic and significance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a challenge which – on an annual perspective – we, too, face with the 2005 budget. The principles unanimously approved in the Committee on Budgets – and I take this opportunity of thanking all colleagues and political groups for their constructive input – point in that direction: rigour, transparency, a further step towards simplification and a concentration on priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals – as I must reiterate to the Commissioner – are consistent with the Commission’s annual strategic plan. We shall obviously see whether, during the course of the procedure, we can continue to remain in step – that, in any event, is our hope – and we shall see if the cautious openness shown by the Council will give rise to any firm decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some points on which, quite frankly, I cannot see how or why we should differ. The first is the increased emphasis on rural development as compared to direct support for agriculture; the second is an adequate level of payments under the Structural Funds heading. After so many years of legitimate complaints, expenditure on Structural Funds by states and regions has accelerated sharply. That was what everyone was hoping to see, and is why it would now be illogical to refrain from guaranteeing adequate resources via supplementary budgets, as has already occurred during the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the reinforcement of support for research, innovation, competitiveness and the internationalisation of companies; the fourth is the promotion of measures for information and the knowledge society; the fifth is the implementation of Europe-wide cultural activities and social policies and the continuation of infrastructure programmes developing the great physical infrastructure of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point – which for me constitutes the first on a political level – is lifelong training, education and youth exchange programmes. Young people must be the prime beneficiaries of our measures because without them there is no Europe and no future. Many of you will recall the beautiful words written by a student on the walls of Berkeley university campus: ‘The future interests me because that is where I plan to live’.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too – here and now – can do something for our youth and for their future. Who can be satisfied that European expenditure for the young represents a mere 0.5% of our budget? That is why we must introduce a European youth pact, increasing measures to foster knowledge, training, language learning and access to the employment market.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are taking place with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, the Commission and the Council, on the possibility of extending the Erasmus programme to secondary school pupils, of launching an Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and of following up a pilot project promoting the mobility of young apprentices. However, I am also thinking of pilot projects providing access to credit through ethical and solidarity-based financing and measures to prepare small companies to face the new situations defined in the Basle agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must agree that the Union’s traditional tasks and priorities have to be reconciled with the new priorities for external action, from the provision of further aid to Afghanistan and Iraq to support for countries hit by the tsunami or other natural disasters. Otherwise, how can we maintain a high and adequate level of financing for the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle East and the Balkans, or for development and humanitarian aid measures, for action to combat poverty and the diseases linked to it, for the respect for human rights and the struggle against terrorism – to name but a few major commitments – while at the same time providing what we have promised to Afghanistan, Iraq and South-East Asia, without adequate financial provision under heading 4?</p>
<p class="contents">We, the members of the Committee on Budgets, believe that there can be a natural and inherent convergence in these areas between current budget concerns and a positive agreement with the Commission’s stance.</p>
<p class="contents">Things which may appear logical, natural and rightful do not always have an easy passage, however. All too often, there are other considerations that take precedence, sectional interests and selfish calculations which prevail over this great joint project, which we can, and must, develop together. Perhaps all it would need is for each of us to take the trouble every day to do a simple little calculation, one requiring no calculator, a very quick sum which always gives the same result, namely a comparison of the costs of Europe with the costs of no Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall do our part and I hope that at the end of the process, thanks to everyone’s contribution, we shall obtain a result which is positive for the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank Mr Pittella for having formed a very balanced approach; it is a step in the direction of achieving the platform of priorities common to both the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission adopted the APS 2006 decision on 2 March. For the Commission’s APS, this will frame both the PDB and the work programme for 2006 in line with the Commission’s five-year strategic objective. In particular, the first APS priority is focused on improving the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, as you also mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is Parliament’s turn to put forward its guidelines, and from Mr Pittella’s report I am pleased to see that the positions of Parliament and the Commission are close on many issues. The Commission’s general approach to the preparation of the 2006 budget will be mainly concentrated on five priorities. Firstly, to keep modulation for the Commission’s proposals to reinforce the ceilings for agriculture. Secondly, on payment appropriations, the Commission will base its position on the most reliable estimates of needs, and will report on the implementation of the funds in 2005 by July. Thirdly, on internal policies, Parliament’s priorities are globally shared by the Commission and will be reflected in its proposal, while leaving the margin under the ceiling well over EUR 100 million, including the youth policies, as already mentioned today. Fourthly, on external action, the needs are once again significant. That means that the Commission will call for the use of the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards human resources, we hear that there is a new proposal and that the Commission subscribes fully to the analysis made by the previous Commission. This was presented in 2002 in a communication on the consequences of enlargement on human resources. Parliament has also acknowledged the legitimacy of this request by inserting the principle of 3900 new posts for the EU-10 enlargement in the budgetary remarks of the 2005 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In our mind there is no need for a review just one year after accession, but we need to implement what we have jointly agreed with Parliament. On this basis, for 2006, the Commission confirms the request of 700 new posts for the current enlargement and, in addition, it will request 100 external staff for preparing the next enlargement to remain in Bulgaria. The Commission will cooperate closely with the rapporteur and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and with the other arms of the budget authority to agree in December on the 2006 budget for the European Union and its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Millennium Project’s ‘quick wins’, which we have put into our budget opinion acknowledges that often the simplest ideas turn out to be the best. Too often in politics we see the quest for headline-grabbing initiatives taking priority over what should be the actual aim.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome what this ‘quick wins’ budgetary proposal involved because the result of the investment into the quick wins programmes is visible after two years. That means giving out malaria bed nets, free primary education and fertiliser, and promoting basic hygiene. These are simple things that we can do quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Water and sanitation are also critical for human welfare. One hygiene measure that I feel particularly strongly about is hand washing. This is not a glamorous subject. Hand washing with soap is not an innovative idea, but diarrhoeal diseases kill 2 million children every year. Hand washing with soap and water can reduce this by 47%. A million lives per year can be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">As we strive towards the development goals, these are simple projects that I ask the Commission to put into place, which will make a huge difference over the vast quantities of money that we have already spent under the EDF and the Community development budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Another under-utilised resource we need to concentrate on is the European Investment Bank. The EIB has the capacity to lend money. It can lend three times as much as the World Bank. The world knows about the World Bank but knows nothing about the European Investment Bank. Therefore I have put into the budget a grant element to support the interest on the EIB’s lending.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend our opinion to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Pittella is to be congratulated on the external element of his report, but the Trade Committee has three specific points that are not, in our opinion, adequately covered in the report. Firstly, the World Trade talks are going to come to a conclusion in the next year or two and they will go through a crucial phase at the end of this year. We believe that to have credibility these talks need a parliamentary dimension and for a parliamentary dimension to be successful it needs to be funded, so we would like to see more money in the budget to cover the parliamentary dimension of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the macro-financial assistance that goes to third countries, most particularly to Bosnia and Herzegovina, does not, in our opinion, have an adequate legal base and it is not properly monitored. We believe we need the codecision procedure implemented for this to bring transparency and accountability to this important area of expenditure. Finally, for a long time we have had an executive trading programme for Japan and Korea which has enabled us to get access to these markets. We believe it is now time to extend these programmes to cover China and India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact is that this sector, which is crucial to many European regions, is facing problems that urgently require decisive action at Community level to protect the income and employment of fishing communities and coastal areas. Furthermore, 2006 is a crucial transitional year for the reform of the common fisheries policy, which will have a new financial instrument: the European Fisheries Fund. The allocation planned for this Fund seems to us to be clearly insufficient to meet our needs, which include improving the control of the application of the legislation, greater guarantees in the field of data protection, as well as quality and objectivity in scientific information and, furthermore, we are being asked to guarantee sustainable development and proper management of natural resources, as well as support for the implementation of the new regional councils. We believe it to be essential to increase the budgetary resources for the CFP, in order to deal with the real needs of a Europe of 27. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Annual Policy Strategy presented by the Commission in March establishes the Commission’s policy priorities for 2006, identifies the initiatives that will help to achieve them, and adopts the budgetary framework so that the priorities receive the necessary resources. It is important to know that this is the first APS adopted by the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At EU level 2006 will be critical with regard to the implementation of the five EU strategic objectives adopted by Parliament, including the Lisbon Strategy, the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Social Agenda (2006-2010), as well as the achievement of the main target of restored growth and jobs in Europe. A review of the Hague Programme, linked to the entry into force of the Constitution, is already foreseen for the second half of 2006. In addition, the EU enlargement process will enter into a new phase and the European Neighbourhood Policy will be deepened.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2006 will be critical in preparing for the 2007-13 Financial Perspective period, to ensure adequate programming, and establishing a new generation of financial instruments to be fully operational on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priorities for 2006 are the following: prosperity and solidarity; security within the Union; a more competitive and cohesive Europe; a Europe that is stronger in the world. Our budgetary strategy – its principles as well as sectoral priorities – are clearly identified in the report and a motion for a resolution that concerns structural operations, internal policies, agriculture, external actions as well as personnel and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Pittella for his cooperation and I support his report and motion for a resolution with the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group and, in particular, an amendment that calls on the Commission to present by 31 July a review of the medium-term staff needs related to the requested new posts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted to congratulate Mr Pittella on this report and also for succeeding in the by no means trivial task of anticipating the Commission’s communication on its annual strategy some time ago. We do indeed want to continue to identify the European Union’s priorities, be successful in our continuing work on enlargement and above all succeed in re-launching the Lisbon policy. Mr Pittella has also succeeded in taking account of the current status of the negotiations on the future financial perspective. The objectives set out by the Commission in its communication are ambitious. But already we fear that the budgetary resources will not be commensurate with our hopes. For us, re-launching the Lisbon Strategy means above all creating high-quality jobs. We will therefore pay particular attention to assessing how realistic the aid to SMEs and micro-enterprises is and how it will be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you to our rapporteur for introducing a new notion into our budget: ethical financing instruments. The European Union should continue and indeed consolidate all of those actions that help to create social cohesion and promote human rights everywhere, as well as those that give our young people and our citizens opportunities to meet each other and listen to each other, thus gaining a better understanding of our culture and European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen that we should continue to work with the Commission to set up pilot projects and preparatory actions. If we are to do so, we will also need to find new and better forms of communication. So far, despite our requests, the results really have fallen short of our expectations. The Commission needs to develop a professional strategy to meet our needs, which are to inform the public regularly about our political projects and the decisions taken by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I should like to draw your attention to the amendment that we will be putting to the vote tomorrow. The solidarity fund should be available to all European citizens, regardless of where they are in the world, if disaster strikes. When providing aid, the European Union should keep its word and remember the commitments it has made about its objectives, in particular when it comes to giving development aid to the poorest countries of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to support democratic change in those countries that expect European Union support. There too, we are going to lack sufficient resources. This year, once again, the ball will be in the Council’s court. We hope that it proves to be equal to its promises and commitments. The role of the European Union depends on it, as does the credibility, for our citizens, of our promises and projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, 2006 is a special year in budgetary terms because it is the last year falling under the ‘Agenda 2000’ budgetary framework. This means that, in certain respects, we have a limited degree of freedom. There are a number of issues, however, that are raised year after year. We in Parliament must once again make efforts to ensure that the payment appropriations required for the structural policy are in place. Last year, we saw that, in fact, more money was needed than was budgeted for. The funding of the decentralised agencies is another recurring problem, as we saw in the negotiations concerning the 2005 budget. This is something for which a solution needs to be found. Finally, there is the problem of funding new priorities and new tasks that arise, such as the reconstruction following the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe attach great importance to the Lisbon Process and particularly to the programmes in which we develop the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises through the European Investment Fund, because a fairly low level of resources in the budget has a very great dispersal effect and secures economic growth in a way that is very cheap for the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Where EU foreign policy is concerned, we consider it very important to give the combating of HIV/AIDS high priority in the budget. We also believe that the budget should particularly support the EU’s neighbourhood policy, so that we promote democracy and human rights in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the EU information policy, for which special efforts and particular attention are also required. In this area, we must, in particular, develop cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are only the first kilometres of a long marathon.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has been in touch with different groups and investigated their focus areas for the preparation of the budget. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left consider it important that social and economic solidarity is strengthened, as well as environmental policy. We give our support to the rapporteur in his endeavours to give these issues priority in the budget. Our group understands all too well that adequate payment appropriations should be secured to finance all payment commitments made.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to remind the representatives of the Council of the fact that, if no agreement on this budget or on the financial perspective in future years are reached, according to the current basic agreement, payment appropriations will in any case be 1.06% of the GNP. As seen from the point of view of Parliament, there is no point in the Council proposing any lower payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention the financing of the Natura 2000 programme, one of the rapporteur’s focus areas. It is unclear how funds are being allocated for the purposes of the programme. I agree with the rapporteur that we should cautiously prepare for new Community-subsidised areas. Today nobody knows how joint funding is used for Natura 2000 or how exactly the costs should be shared between the Member States and the Union. It would be reasonable, if Member States with large populations and few Natura areas would, through the EU, contribute towards the protection of our common European natural environment in the more sparsely populated Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The view of our group is negative as regards the financing of any expenditure to militarise the Union or which, protected by the smoke screen of information services, is used to finance propaganda to support the federal development of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Demands for increased appropriations for new areas of expenditure are put forward without the basic problems being dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you of three such problems. Firstly, almost half of EU expenditure goes on an agricultural policy that all sensible people without vested interests in the issue have to regard as completely unreasonable. Secondly, almost another third goes on regional aid to rich countries. There is no way in which we can agree to increasing the Member States’ contributions to the EU as long as most of the money that is now paid in is used in this directly damaging way. Thirdly, the problems are not analysed in a sensible, sociological way. The basic attitude here is to throw money at problems. Often, however – and perhaps more often than not – it is systems of rules that determine how the economy operates, not money from the state. We must allow the countries themselves to decide on these issues. That is what democracy is about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
