In this respect, I am that much wiser now and wished to thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter, heckling: cynic!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to get to the point, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf!</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is prepared to provide exceptional assistance to Kosovo as quickly as possible, which is why we accepted the request for urgent procedure this week. We want to make our contribution as quickly as possible; we do not want to throw up any obstacles which prevent peace from being restored in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">But, my dear Commissioner, please take our request seriously; after all the cooperation in this procedure, this will only happen in the long run if we are given the information we need to carry out our parliamentary control function properly, safeguard coherence with other programmes, such as CARDS, and apply a uniform procedure here, in cooperation with UNMIK.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we have to understand that one of the main problems in this region is due to the fact that numerous groups are trying – with a great deal of commitment – to provide help, but with very little coordination. It is an age-old problem which Parliament deplores and which the Commission itself deplores. That is why, despite all this commitment, many of them are still failing to achieve the positive results which we consider necessary. Because, if too little progress has been made in Kosovo so far, this also has to do with the fact that Macedonia is being destabilised from within Kosovo, with all that this implies.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we also think that a correlation needs to be established with other donors and how much rapid financial assistance they are willing to provide. We expressly adopted a proposed amendment in committee which does not attach any conditions to services by other donors, but the correlation needs to be established, so that the European Union is not left standing alone in the front row here and other donors honour their promises accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of this programme is to build up a reasonable administration, to build up a reasonable infrastructure and to build up reasonable, self-perpetuating economic growth, thereby creating the conditions needed to bring about lasting stability and peaceful coexistence between people and ethnic groups. That is why we look on this assistance as an offer to the people there. But now the people must show willing and understand that the circle of violence has to be broken.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lechner and I specifically discussed today, this political correlation needs to be clearly discussed here. That is why, Commissioner, I should like once again to stress that we do not want to be a hindrance when it comes to approving funds quickly and that we need to make a joint effort to ensure that these funds are used sensibly and are not wasted and that urgent objectives are in fact achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need and we want to give money and we want to give it quickly. We are more than prepared to do so but certain framework conditions have to be complied with. One thing is for sure and that is that we demand that the majority in Kosovo give the present minority, i.e. the Serbs, Romas, Sinti, Bosnians etc. a chance to develop and live a proper life in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a particularly decisive question when elections are held in autumn. How representative will these elections be? I am delighted that elections are being held, but how representative will they be if not everyone in the country can take part or those who do later flee?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: another decisive point – as Mr Brok mentioned – is that we expect the Albanian majority in Kosovo to distance itself from all the small groups – not the Albanians per se in Macedonia, but the small groups, the KLA or quasi-KLA organisations up to no good in Macedonia. This is absolutely essential because Macedonia has a democracy, unlike in former Yugoslavia, where it is understandable up to a point when people take up arms in order to defend themselves against terrorism and repression. But Macedonia has a democracy, democratic potential, and the European Union in particular will help the Albanian minority, which is a large minority in Macedonia, to develop. But we expect the Albanian majority in Kosovo, with all due respect for the justified claims of their brothers and sisters in Macedonia, to distance themselves from terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: I think that, as far as economic questions are concerned, it is important for Kosovo to develop its own economic resources over the course of time. I refer in particular to the question of the mines in Trebca. I know that mines are not necessarily a modern economy's first choice nowadays, but I think that every avenue needs to be explored – even if the conditions of ownership have not been completely clarified – so that they can develop their own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">A problem arises in this context and I am delighted that Commissioner Solbes Mira is here and I can specifically ask him. The problem which arises concerns the changeover to the euro. What will happen to the de facto currency in Kosovo and in other areas of the Balkans, but especially in Kosovo? I refer to the Deutschmark. I read in a report recently that this will cause huge problems and I should like to ask you Commissioner if the Commission has thought about this or made any announcements on this? Will the Commission address this and, if so, when, so that some form of solution can be found to this question, which is fundamental to the development of Kosovo? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we still have not worked out how to cut the Gordian knot around Kosovo, despite numerous attempts. Ladies and gentlemen, if a neutral observer were to come to every sitting of the European Parliament, he would conclude that we are a monotonous lot. FYROM, Kosovo, former Yugoslavia. Our obsession with this subject basically illustrates that we are at an impasse. We must find a way out of this impasse. Meeting after meeting, prime ministers, ministers, representatives, visits, but still no results.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are being asked to approve more financial assistance for Kosovo and we must approve it so that we can help the people working there to resolve the problems. But, you see, every irregularity in the area as a whole emanates from Kosovo. In other words, maybe we are providing a safe haven there, from which various terrorist groups are able to organise terrorist attacks on the area with impunity?</p>
<p class="contents">We have witnessed the end of the Milosevic era and that is a good thing. But immediately afterwards we witnessed a development in southern Serbia, a half-hearted attempt at destabilisation in Montenegro, which proper intervention halted. And then, you see, there was the threat in southern Serbia that the Yugoslav army would return to the border. Perhaps we should now allow the Yugoslav army to proceed to the border with Kosovo, as provided for by the UN, perhaps this threat can be partly defused? I find it really strange that, with thousands of soldiers in Kosovo, it is not possible to close the border, it is not possible to seal the border and prevent FYROM and the area as a whole from being destabilised. It is most strange. If one soldier were to sit next to another at five-metre intervals, they would form an unbroken barrier at the border.</p>
<p class="contents">So in this sense, it is good that the political efforts being made on all sides are accompanied by grim determination. Because, you see, any continuation of this instability in the area will lead nowhere. If some people think that new nation states are going to emerge from this tragedy, they are wrong. The area is so badly fragmented by minorities, which in some places have the majority vote and in some places have the minority vote, that we shall end up with federations of villages, with federations of towns if we are to be able to say that there is some sort of cohesion. In other words, if anyone ever dreams about ethnically clean areas, they will look like DNA diagrams.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I believe that, apart from financial assistance, we need pressure, pressure and political unity to stabilise and develop the area, and we need political solutions within existing borders. And that is what we must secure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that it is essential to point out that we are not talking here today about part of the action used by the CART programmes and therefore, we are not talking about Kosovo aid projects as part of the European Agency for Reconstruction. We are talking about macroeconomic aid to Kosovo, which is a different type of measure. We are talking simply about budget aid for the United Nations administration in the area. As a result, some of the problems that you have put forward in your proposals, as we will see later, should, in our opinion, be interpreted differently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community made a contribution of this type in 2000, amounting to EUR 35 million, and the proposal that we adopted in March of this year involves EUR 30 million, which will be allocated to the Kosovo budget in two parts, in order to start up or rather to maintain the operation of UNMIK in the area. Of course we are responsible for the fourth pillar, and this also means paying particular attention to some of the essential changes to the economic system that are currently being made. We are not talking about our aid, but about elements associated with the introduction of a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a great deal of progress, for example, in establishing a banking and payment system, in developing the private sector and in aspects of taxation, including obviously all aspects of public spending.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about an exceptional type of aid, which is not dedicated to specific projects and is not linked to any other type of commitment. In this respect it is radically different from the CART aid, which is why it needs a different legal basis, as we explain in our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With this aid, as in the past, we are going to fund the current expenditure of Kosovo’s budget, and we are talking about salaries for judges, teachers, doctors, the sale, or rather support of public utilities, and, in short, about the basic costs of running the country. It is true that there is some investment expenditure associated with public companies, but we are mainly talking about current expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in answer to some of Mr Brok’s questions, first of all a system should be put in place to enable Kosovo to gradually take on its own financial costs. We agree with this idea and our medium-term objective is for the Kosovo budget to be able to fund itself. Last year, the funding was 50-50. Our aim is that progress should continue to be made and we hope that in 2001, 75% of the total budget will be covered by own funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of your concerns was to know what is happening with the other donors. There is a reasonable amount of burden-sharing between the donors. For the 2001 budget there are other donors who are going to contribute, namely the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Turkey, Canada and the World Bank, to a total of EUR 43 million. Out of these EUR 43 million, EUR 31 million have already been paid out, which is clearly positive and enables us to be reasonably satisfied about the problem of equal distribution of the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are not considering an additional budgetary allocation. There are resources to carry out this funding with the proportion of the macroeconomic aid included in budgetary heading B7-548 related to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, when we implement this assistance, we not only insist on establishing a stable economic framework, but also on policies being created that are aimed at achieving economic stability. Along with the other donors we are continuing with the necessary commitments in order to pay out these amounts, as the Kosovo authorities have to comply with the obligations and commitments made.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments that have been put forward, I would like to make a few comments that could help the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we can quite readily accept some of the amendments. I am referring to Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6 and 9. We feel that there are other amendments that are not justified, not because we disagree with them in principle, but because they are not necessary: for example, Amendments Nos 4 and 5, which refer to the distribution of the burden. This is clearly covered in Recital 9, which says that "the provision of external budgetary support, fairly shared among donors, is essential to help cover the residual financing needs ".</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we consider Amendment No 10 to be necessary, because it states that the aid must clearly focus on the budget. The aid is purely budgetary, and it is not therefore necessary to highlight a point that we feel should be taken for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a series of amendments which, in my opinion, are mistaken in their understanding of the nature of macroeconomic aid: these are Amendments Nos 2, 8 and 13, which refer to linking this type of macroeconomic aid with the CART programme, and they therefore ask for the same conditions as for the CART projects. However, we are not talking about CART, but about something completely different. This is not one of my colleague Chris Patten’s responsibilities. I myself have direct sole and exclusive responsibility for the budget within the area of macroeconomic aid. Therefore, we think that these amendments should not be included, because they would cause some confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a series of amendments regarding deadlines, procedures and monitoring, in particular Amendments Nos 7, 11 and 14. I would like to comment on each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">A problem about which Mr Brok is particularly concerned is that of information. Obviously we are prepared to provide all the necessary information. The problem arises if this information has to be drawn up in the context of other aid, in accordance with the progress of the reform. We are currently providing information on macroeconomic aid and we are prepared to do so and include this aid with other macroeconomic aid, providing all the necessary information so that Parliament can effectively carry out its monitoring work.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 considers the possibility of creating a group within the Council, of a political nature, to undertake consultations on the implementation of this aid. I stress this again, we are talking about a different type of aid, and we think that the systems already in place for macroeconomic aid should be applied, and not systems for other types of measure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem indicated in Amendment No 14, the need for the conditions of economic policy to be fulfilled and for a link to be established with Amendment No 4 and for the funds to be used for this type of aid, we do not think that this corresponds to the nature of this measure. We are talking here about assistance, as I was saying, for UNMIK’s budget, with very specific objectives. It is true that we should also use these objectives in order to improve the economic situation and the market economy in Kosovo, but there are not conditions as with other types of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a comment on two other amendments that I think are of interest: Amendment No 12 asks for two things. Firstly, for the aid to be implemented within a maximum of six weeks. We can undertake to implement it as soon as possible. We think that to aim to pay out the assistance in the middle of August, at a time when we all know the difficulties with budgetary procedures, is at best a risky idea. For this reason we do not think that this request is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possibility of passing on the memorandum of understanding that is made between UNMIK and the Commission, I must point out that this memorandum contains some sensitive information and therefore we think that a more efficient system is for this information to be given to the chairmen of the various committees, but under no circumstances for the memorandum of understanding to be sent out.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission could accept Amendment No 14 if it were worded differently. That is, if the report were presented in September of the previous year, as these reports are prepared for June and if we could provide the information by September, but not before. The Commission accepts the spirit of the request, but we think that its wording needs to be improved in order to prevent practical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment on Mr Swoboda’s question on the use of the euro in the Kosovo area. I would remind you that, as you know, this was a unilateral decision taken by the Kosovo authorities. The German Central Bank is perfectly aware of this information and of this situation, and the Kosovo bank and payment authority, the German Central Bank and the Austrian Central Bank are currently in contact in order to seek a solution to the problem. I can therefore inform you that these talks are now taking place and I hope that they will achieve a favourable result so that the change will pose as few problems as possible. The Commission is following this matter with the greatest interest, although it is more directly the responsibility of the European Central Bank and the national central banks than of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
