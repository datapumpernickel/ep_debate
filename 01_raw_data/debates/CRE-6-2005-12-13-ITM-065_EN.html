<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miloš Koterec (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(SK)</span> The provision of state aid is an issue that has long been the focus of attention in the European Union, for the reason that differences in approach and in the resources deployed by the various Member States have led to unfair competition, favouring some companies and distorting economic development across regions and even states of the European Union. Uncoordinated state aid has also distorted the Community’s basic objectives in the area of cohesion. It was therefore only natural that the Union should start to regulate state aid and that the bodies of the Community should increasingly strive, within the context of such experience, to develop a unified approach in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">When the opportunity came along of producing a report for the European Parliament on the Commission’s draft guidelines dealing with regional aid as a tool of regional development, I viewed it as an invitation to contribute towards improving the way the Community functions in this area. It is an area that attracts widespread attention not only because of the practice of providing significant cash injections for private companies, but also because of the way that taxpayers’ money is used for what may be seen as private purposes, albeit where there is a clear public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The long process of negotiation between the Commission, the Council, Parliament and other interested parties, which eventually took a year despite the modest scope of the issue, provided confirmation of the complexities involved in the task of seeking to balance regulation in this area. In July of this year, the Commission presented the revised proposal which forms the basis of my current report and which itself is based on the second informal draft and on the previously mentioned negotiations. I can say that I broadly welcome the Commission’s decision to pursue a philosophy of providing less and better-targeted state aid, in fulfilment of the Barcelona and Gothenburg European Councils’ conclusions concerning reductions in the level of state aid and its focus on subjects of common interest, including economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking account also of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, I have concluded that the Commission’s interest is to provide clear support for the fulfilment of cohesion objectives. I say this because I am convinced that the provision of state aid and assistance programmes through structural funds are two complementary instruments for the EU to employ in pursuit of cohesion. That is why I think also that it is so important to support the Commission proposals for providing state aid under the process of convergence with EU standards to regions located mainly in the new Member States. It is fanciful to think that state aid can be properly regulated in the interests of fair economic competition without taking full account of all the aspects of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In my original draft of the report I sought to emphasise the above-mentioned approach, along with the need for an equitable distribution of state aid throughout the whole of the EU. I also stressed that we must not neglect any region or sub-region where state aid is needed in order to achieve cohesion. My aim was to back those proposals that would make the Commission’s regional aid guidelines a real tool for the support of regional development. During the approval process I was happy to accept any amendment proposals that coincided with these aims, and that is why I supported the idea of including statistical regions in the category under Article 87(3)(a) for the provision of relevant state aid to all regions with natural handicaps or disadvantages that make it impossible for them to initiate development, or regions that have for various reasons fallen into the group of poor areas, as well as proposals restricting the destructive relocation of enterprises receiving state aid, and others. I was also happy to add proposals requesting that the criteria for determining the entitlement to state aid for individual regions and firms be defined as precisely as possible, and I expect the Commission to make a thorough assessment of the negative impacts of inappropriately provided aid and to draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I fully supported the idea of taking regional factors into account in the horizontal guidelines for the provision of state aid. It will not be possible, however, to implement effectively all of the Commission’s well-intentioned proposals for the regional aid guidelines or the related recommendations from the European Parliament unless the procedures are simplified, which the Commission has to a large extent suggested as well. Implementation will also require complete transparency over the provision of state aid both at the national and European levels, including the integration of state aid for regional development into the national reference framework. The recommendations for integrating regional self-government into the process of state aid distribution, for the publication of all cases of state aid on the Internet, and for public access to the assessments of the implementation of state aid instruments for regional development carried out by the Commission will certainly contribute to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I must say that the final text of my report differs somewhat from my expectations. Along with many fellow Members who participated in the creation of the final text, I have had to cut back my plans for an objective assessment of the Commission’s proposals. Some of the recommendations may go beyond the frame of reference defined in the principles set out by the Commission, but I trust that the Commission will examine all well-intended recommendations from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the regions affected by poverty and inadequate development are looking to the guidelines we are proposing in the hope that they will contribute effectively to their development. Only then will they be able to say, along with all of us who are working for the successful advancement of the whole European Union together, that Community instruments are the right means for ensuring the welfare of all citizens of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, the review of the regional aid rules is an integral part of the general reform of state aid policy, as was mentioned by the rapporteur. The overall objective is to adjust the state aid rules to the new approach to the structural funds for 2007-2013, and to give practical effect to the conclusions of the European Council, which call for less and better targeted state aid. Regional aid reform implies strict control of the more distortive aids by limiting the scope for investment aid for large firms to the regions most in need, in particular, as regards very large investment projects. The reform also allows Member States a sufficient degree of flexibility to design aid matters to promote the realisation of the Lisbon objectives and targets.</p>
<p class="contents">That additional flexibility is just one of the elements which was introduced into the package as a result of consultation, including my discussions with the Committee on Regional Development. Our approach is coherent with the state aid action plan, which recognises the need to allow regional aid in order to promote cohesion and convergence but emphasises that this should be targeted on the regions most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate the importance of the principle of concentration. If the aid is spread too thinly and too widely, it simply will not help the regions most in need. We also provide for limited additional coverage, which is put at the disposal of the Member States concerned. Naturally, we expect Member States to target that aid on the areas most in need at national level and it is up to them to identify those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">When I read the report, I feel bound to say that we are being asked to spread this form of aid too widely. The assumption seems to be that areas which are not eligible for regional aid are not eligible for any form of state aid. Allow me to correct that impression: according to the latest state aid scoreboard, the type of aid we are talking about today – regional aid – makes up less than 20% of all state aid granted in the EU, excluding the agricultural, fisheries and transport sectors. Those regions not eligible for regional aid will continue to receive other forms of support through the horizontal aid measures that are covered by the state aid action plan: aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, research and development, innovation, training, employment and risk capital. Following a very extensive consultation process, I believe we are moving towards a global compromise that should meet the legitimate concerns of the vast majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">No compromise is perfect and some limited adjustments to the text are always possible. However, I will study your proposals very carefully before putting a final package before the College next week for adoption. However, it will not be possible significantly to modify the overall balance that has been struck in the guidelines; otherwise we would risk upsetting the large majority of Member States which welcome and support our text, and might call the whole exercise into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This aid therefore also contributes to economic growth and job creation in the region in question. It is entirely natural that most State aid is granted in the European Union’s neediest regions, since it helps to reduce regional disparities, similarly to the Structural Funds. The priority should therefore be to use State aid in convergence regions, pursuant to Article 87(3)(a).</p>
<p class="contents">The same Article must also, however, apply to regions affected by the statistical effect, as demanded in the Third Progress Report on economic and social cohesion, and it must continue to apply until the end of the programming period in 2013. The obligation to maintain investment within the relevant regions must remain in place for at least five years – I repeat, five years – after the investment. Seven years would have been preferable, but five years is the absolute minimum needed in order to prevent ‘investment hopping’ wherever possible. This five-year period should be enforced in the case of both large companies and SMEs, in order to avoid State aid being used as an incentive to relocate jobs to other areas of the EU, and as a source of funding for large-scale redundancies and plant closures. If State aid is used, monitored and analysed correctly, it can be a useful tool to boost growth and job creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these is the relocation of businesses. It goes without saying that no one in this European Union of ours wants businesses to relocate their operations with the sole purpose of qualifying for aid. There have already been cases in every Member State, however, where the regions were glad to have the opportunity to provide State aid for investments, with the support of the European Union. What we need here are regulations that are not only clear and transparent, but also fair and guided by the principle of solidarity. This is what the report calls for, and I hope that the Commission will play its part in achieving such regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to the regions affected by the statistical effect, to which Mr Berend has already referred. I fail to understand how it can be possible, given that Commissioner Hübner has always supported our decision to treat the statistical effect regions as Objective 1 regions for the entire 2007-2013 period – and this decision was backed by a large majority – for Mrs Kroes now to put forward an entirely different idea, namely that this period should be divided into two parts. I hope that the Commission will start to realise that Parliament can also have good ideas now and again, and that it is entirely justified in wanting to provide support to the statistical effect regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was a little disappointed to hear the comments of the Commissioner that only minor changes will be accommodated. I was certainly pleased that our committee supported the amendments to maintain as Article 87(3)(a) the status of the statistical effect regions for the entire programming period. I also fully supported the call for the economic development regions to be entitled to the maximum levels of aid intensity with their transitional arrangement for these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of my own region, the BMW region in Ireland, this will help to ensure that there is not a sudden fall in aid levels but rather a gradual change, which will not cause too severe a shock to the system. Furthermore, I commend the proposal to create a safety net, to ensure that no Member State loses more than 50% of its population covered during 2000-2006 because that will allow Member States the flexibility to intervene in certain areas where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I want briefly to raise another issue in the context of state aid, which is not dealt with by this report but is critical nonetheless. Sometimes state aid rules hinder EU regions from competing with non-Member regions and states for mobile investment projects. The Commissioner referred to Lisbon and, in order to achieve the objectives of more and better jobs, EU regions must be competitive within Europe but equally competitive with the rest of the world. We do not exist in a vacuum and we must look outwards as well as inwards. It should be possible for the EU to devise a system whereby Member States and regions can compete with non-Member States for mobile projects, while at the same time ensuring that Member States do not attempt to outbid each other.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I believe that we need an assessment of the impact that state aids have in determining if a project can be located in the EU with state aid, or outside the EU without state aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the report confirms, cohesion policies and state aid policies are complementary. State aid is a key instrument available to Member States to promote regional development and genuine convergence between the various countries of the EU. It is also an important lever in promoting public investment and sustainable economic development, and in ensuring that public services are provided in the least favoured regions. High quality public services are a crucial factor in implementing the objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Each State must define its public sectors and services, its suitable financing and its organisation. Under no circumstances, therefore, must these areas fall within the scope of the implementation of rules on state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must be able, in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, to use this instrument to respond appropriately to the specific needs relating to the development of the least favoured regions. Competition in international trade is putting increasing pressure on the least favoured regions, by causing the closure and relocation of companies and increased unemployment, which has a terrible impact on the development of many regions, not least in countries such as Portugal. We therefore say once again that the Member States, with EU backing, have a duty to take action to address these situations, be it through state aid or other funding measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that the obligation to maintain investment in the regions for a minimum period of five years is woefully inadequate and must be increased. State aid must not promote the relocation of companies, either in full or in part, within or outside the EU. We believe that the state aid awarded to companies should be subject to a long-term commitment in terms of the duration of the investment, the number of jobs created and guarantees on workers’ rights. Money should be returned in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore we believe that the relative wealth of the regions and consequent eligibility for this aid should be based on GDP per capita. With new indicators being incorporated, we believe that the population’s level of qualifications is a relevant factor. These are just some of the proposals that we put forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That should ring serious alarm bells, but we are turning a deaf ear. The eight eastern European countries that have already joined the EU, plus Bulgaria and Romania, have been promised EUR 139 billion out of the total structural funds budget of EUR 336 billion for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">An exhibition that the Dutch Presidency put on in Brussels last December predicted that another ten impoverished countries will join the EU by 2022.

It is about time we scrapped this whole crazy idea and helped out those poorer countries by creating opportunities for increased trade, tourism, etc.</p>

It should therefore be distributed on the basis of clear and transparent criteria, and targeted at areas where it really will produce the desired results. If these principles are followed, State aid will help individual EU regions to develop more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to present an annual report on the actual amount of State aid granted by each Member State. After all, this type of aid is a clear-cut case of interference in the free market. It goes without saying that this interference is more often than not justified, but it is certainly not justified when it is used to support inefficient companies. We should bear this in mind in view of the growing interest in the use of public-private partnerships to implement a variety of infrastructure investments. Although such interest is otherwise legitimate, these partnerships offer a great temptation for all sorts of abuses, which we can only hope will be resisted.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information at my disposal, around EUR 62 billion was spent on State aid last year in the EU as a whole. EUR 17.2 billion of this figure was spent in Germany, EUR 8.9 billion in France, EUR 7 billion in Italy and only EUR 2.9 billion in Poland. I have my doubts as to whether this money was spent in an entirely rational manner. There are not enough forms of aid for what are known as horizontal investments, examples of which include support for small and medium-sized enterprises, environmental protection measures, the development of research and the stimulation of innovation. The Commissioner herself said as much a few moments ago. This should be the main focus of State aid, as it is only by prioritising such goals that it will contribute to the real development of individual regions. Sectors or large companies that perform poorly should only receive public funds on a temporary basis, and only when these funds are genuinely used for restructuring activities and to increase the profitability of businesses. If this is not the case, public funds will simply go to waste.</p>
<p class="contents">State aid that directly or indirectly supports regional development should promote territorial, social and economic cohesion. It should serve as a unique tool for implementing a policy of alignment, which would be an expression of solidarity between the Member States and within the Community as a whole. In this context, I believe that the initiative of the Polish Government, aimed at launching a programme for Eastern Poland, is eminently sensible. Eastern Poland covers regions that have the lowest GDP per capita in the EU, such as Subcarpathia, Lubelszczyzna and Podlasie.</p>
<p class="contents">Urban conurbations act as metropolitan centres for local regions, and merit particular attention. The recent events in French cities are proof that the consequences of social exclusion can be truly dramatic. In addition, we should not neglect regions suffering high unemployment, which is an affliction that is sometimes passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural areas are another key focus of action, since an increasing number of challenging economic, social and demographic problems are encountered there. In my opinion, it is essential that a clear definition of ‘eligible costs’ be provided, so that the Member States are in a position to take final decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by voicing my support for the report that has been tabled on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, provided that the additional amendments to it are adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The original proposal did not measure the difference in aid on the basis of GDP levels, but only on whether two different regions had state borders. This supremely discriminatory and inconsistent rule has been replaced, under pressure from Member States, by a different, rule, which one can say is at least consistent. The state borders between regions no longer play a role. The problem was supposedly solved by bringing in regions affected by the statistical effect of enlargement. This technical terminology is misleading in the extreme, however, in that it covers enormous differences in the development levels of individual regions. In the Algarve region of Portugal, for example, or the Lüneburg region of Germany, GDP stands at over 80% of the EU average, whereas in the South West of the Czech Republic the figure is only 60.5% of the EU average. Yet all of these regions will have a right to a virtually identical level of aid, which is neither fortunate nor fair, and which is certainly not in keeping with the spirit of solidarity. The new rules on national regional aid were also intended to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness and economic growth, and that is something that the Commission has not come close to achieving. The rules on aid in place before, which were workable on the whole, have been drastically watered down. There is no doubt in my mind that the new rules will lead neither to economic growth nor to the creation of new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, these restrictions on state aid must also have a limit. A large and simultaneous reduction in the appropriations received by the regions through the Structural Funds, on the one hand, and in state aid, on the other, risks turning out to be a disaster for their essential development. Obviously, one such example, as already pointed out, is the regions which fall victim to the statistical effect and see subsidies through the Structural Funds limited as a result of enlargement, on the one hand, and the European Commission saying they may be able to get state aid up to 2009, but that from 2009 onwards there will be problems, on the other. This is unfair. This has been pointed out repeatedly by Parliament and in the Koterec report. This is the third time that this has been pointed out and the Commission needs to take it into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the problem of the islands needs to be addressed, especially in relation to the additional cost of transport for island regions. I have examples from Greece which illustrate that the cost of transport on the islands is three times that needed to travel the same distance on the mainland. My final comment is that we need to look carefully at the risk of company relocations. It must be made clear both by us and by the Commission that companies which receive state aid need to stay where they were when they received the subsidies for at least five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A reduction in assistance would increase the risk of failure in terms of the desired aims of state aid in the new Member States, as it is often the case that these states simply do not have any funding of their own for these purposes. If they did, we would be approaching state aid, the problems of less advanced regions and the issue of cohesion in a completely different way.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a lack of proper analysis and of verifiable studies into the impact of the decisions under consideration. Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed resolution of the Committee on Regional Development and rapporteur Koterec is good, but it will be meaningful only if the level of assistance for new Member States remains unchanged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, however, it is not too far removed from debates on the solidarity principle or on the factors driving economic development, in particular those factors that promote or hinder the existence of functioning economies in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions on State aid granted at regional level fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the European Commission. At the same time, however, Parliament cannot merely be a passive observer of developments in this field, given that it is working actively on a legislative package on cohesion policy. Particular emphasis should therefore be placed on a point made in the report, namely that we expect the Commission to delay its adoption of a position until the new Financial Perspective is agreed on, and until the budget for cohesion policy is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulations on levels of State aid should, if they are formulated correctly, heighten the impact of structural interventions rather than curtailing economic freedoms, by which I also mean business activity. State aid should not become an alternative means of artificially prohibiting such measures as the relocation of businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic activities in the Member States should also be targeted at creating an environment that is conducive to investment in the EU, and at establishing favourable operating conditions that enable forward planning for businesses, rather than at imposing artificial prohibitions that disrupt relations between EU Member States. The consultation of regional and local authorities on the criteria for identifying aid-recipient regions is also absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about a reduced level but improved targeting of state aid in order to provide an effective response to the challenges of economic globalisation, enlargement and the need to restore the Union’s competitiveness. However, there is the risk that some areas will be penalised: state aid must be used to promote competitiveness and innovation, research and development across the whole territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, it would be particularly desirable to create a transition mechanism for the statistical effect regions. I would therefore ask the Commission to take account of the new wording of paragraph 7 of the text of the Koterec report, as approved in the Committee on Regional Development. I invite the European Commission to take note of this and to take the appropriate action, and also to take greater account of the rate of unemployment in a region when determining its status. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of the European Union acknowledges, however, that such aid is acceptable when it is intended to contribute towards the economic development of those regions in which the standard of living is well below the European average. The principle whereby active public policy is justified when it is intended to boost social cohesion is thus enshrined.</p>
<p class="contents">While the free functioning of the market brings benefits in terms of economic development, it alone cannot ensure development. In terms of regional policy, therefore, this kind of state aid could serve to support the least favoured regions. Accordingly, given that state aid and regional policy are complementary, they need to be brought closer together. In this regard, I agree with the rapporteur that regions affected by the statistical effect should be subject to the same arrangements as the convergence objective regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to globalisation, which has brought a fresh problem to the EU’s table, to which I have repeatedly drawn the House’s attention. The problem centres on the fact that regions and sectors built, economically speaking, on manufacturing, run the risk of being wiped off the map. In order to redress this trend, the EU has put forward the idea of the globalisation adjustment fund, an initiative that I support, albeit on the proviso that it be implemented only in regions that, according to likely trends, are at acute social risk.</p>
<p class="contents">This fund must therefore be highly selective and applied only in exceptional circumstances. The focus must be on those regions that fulfil three key characteristics at any given time: high rate of population concentration, high unemployment and specialisation across a range of sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this measure results in a considerable reduction in support, which is inconsistent with the trends in the macroeconomic indicators in some of our regions. It would therefore be a good idea to increase the safety net. Indeed, reducing minimum coverage by considerably less than the 50% proposed would enable us to do justice to the situation in States where the statistical divisions do not take account of regional disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same note, although I am pleased to note that the outermost regions are still eligible under Article 87(3)(a), I find it regrettable that the new proposals are not able to compensate for the announced reduction in aid. The level of aid in the outermost regions must be looked at in a quite specific way, because it is vital to the survival of their economies, not just a competitive adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is illogical to ask the outermost regions to cooperate with neighbouring countries that have much, much lower salary costs, while at the same time drastically reducing the aid provided to their businesses, which is a vital tool in re-establishing fair conditions for regional competition, which has been distorted. The overseas territories absolutely must continue to benefit from a level of aid equal to that currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for adopting my amendment stressing that the guidelines should expressly provide Member States with the possibility of notifying aid projects and the Commission with the possibility of assessing the compatibility of these aid projects using more flexible criteria so that they can take account of any specific issues in the sector or region, and of innovative approaches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ineffective state aid has a detrimental effect on the internal market and economic competitiveness. The text under discussion is a balanced one, taking account of the needs of the poorest regions and those regions affected by the statistical effect. I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has retreated from its original proposal to reduce the intensity of state aid in neighbouring regions to the wealthiest countries, not least the Czech-German and Czech-Austrian border regions, which, as neighbours of the former Iron Curtain, have for many years lagged behind. I do not believe that the solution to the problem of so-called relocation lies in demonising the businesses concerned. For this reason, I feel it would be right and proper for the Commission to pursue an approach to SMEs whereby the proposed deadline for projects undertaken by SMEs be cut to three years. Small businessmen need to be flexible. State aid is an important tool in regional development. The reform of the rules should therefore be based on the principles of effectiveness, transparency and solidarity. I support the drive towards such reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the new draft regional aid guidelines, two principles have been of fundamental importance. Firstly, there is the need to provide a solid contribution to the cohesion policy of the Union by ensuring the maximum possible coherence with the structural fund regulations. Second, there is the need to implement the conclusions of successive European Councils calling for less and better-targeted aid, following the general approach set out in the state aid action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that this reform, which is only a first step in our overall review of state aid rules, will constitute an important contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda and the restoration of European competitiveness, and will act as a driver for the virtuous circle of economic growth, better standards of living and more and better jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the next stage of the wider debate: this is not the last evening that we will be discussing this issue. The next stage of the wider debate will come when Parliament discusses the state aid action plan next year. It is in that context that I take note of several of the comments in the report relating to more wide-ranging issues, such as those mentioned by a couple of honourable Members: block exemptions, the de minimis thresholds and the general rules applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises. I would also like to remind you that important amounts of aid to small and medium-sized enterprises may be granted anywhere, including outside the assisted areas. Aid for research, for development, for training and for environmental protection is also available for large companies wherever they are located, subject to a number of conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘statistical effect regions’ are regions with less than 75% of EU-15 GDP per capita but more than 75% of EU-25 average GDP per capita. De facto they go up to 82.2% EU-25 GDP per capita. Under the draft guidelines these regions will benefit from Article 87(3)(a) status and a 30% aid intensity for aid to large companies for the first part of the programming period as well as the possibility of granting operating aids.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of these regions will be subject to a mid-term review if their GDP has fallen below the 75% EU-25 GDP per capita. They will continue to benefit from Article 87(3)(a) and from operating aid. Otherwise they will be eligible under Article 87(3)(c) with an aid intensity of 20% and they will benefit from transitional provisions. In particular they will be able to continue granting operating aid for two additional years. Therefore, all statistical effect regions will continue to be eligible for regional aid for the whole programming period, either as Article 87(3)(a) or as Article 87(3)(c) regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussions this evening and the amendments tabled to the motion for a resolution lead me to add three more specific points. Firstly, it remains essential to focus regional aid on the neediest regions. That also means defining well balanced and distinctively shaded aid intensities. Secondly, increasing the safety net would risk going against the principle of the exceptional nature of regional aid and might endanger the objective of giving the assisted regions a real boost compared to others. Thirdly, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring that investment remains in a region for the time necessary to contribute to development, and overly restrictive obligations on the investing companies, which would become a disincentive to investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional aid is de facto cofinanced by structural funds in new Member States; old Member States generally use their own budget. A cut in the financial perspective as well as an increase in population coverage would be anti-cohesion and I would like to underline that.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close by simply noting that, on a subject as important as this, any reform can only be successful if it is built on a broad consensus amongst stakeholders. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is an active contributor in this. Again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koterec, and the members of his team, for all their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore an important tool available to Member States to assist poorer regions, such as those impacted by the so-called statistical effect following enlargement, or less-favoured regions such as islands or mountainous areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction and better targeting of state aid are vital factors in promoting effective competition, but care is needed with the parameters proposed in this new approach. They impose excessively high differentials between the 15 and the new Member States, leading to a waste of incentives. This will prejudice subsequent success in attracting new companies, cause the relocation of uncompetitive companies able to survive only with the help of subsidies, and create unjustified competition among the poorest areas of Europe. It is therefore necessary to restore more limited aid levels and reduce the differentials between the maxima of less-developed regions. Lastly, the accent needs to be placed on the planned ‘flexibility’ for aid to large companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
