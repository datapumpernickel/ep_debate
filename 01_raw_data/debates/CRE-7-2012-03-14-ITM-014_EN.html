<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villy Søvndal, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it is again a pleasure to deal with the latest developments on EU activities in Kazakhstan on behalf of Vice-President/High Representative Ashton.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan is a key player in the wider region of Central Asia and an influential actor in international forums. It has recently held the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Since its independence 20 years ago, it has been the European Union’s policy to support Kazakhstan’s economic and political progress. The EU has a strategic interest to further deepen our involvement with Kazakhstan and to fully develop mutual political cooperation potentials, especially considering the rapidly evolving regional integration dynamics.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan is a pragmatic partner, open to reform and willing to explore opportunities. The EU is also an important trade and investment partner for Kazakhstan. The recent start of negotiations on a new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan was a sign of the importance that the EU attaches to its cooperation with Kazakhstan. However, strengthening EU-Kazakhstan relations does not – and cannot – occur independently from the progress of political reforms in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">The respect for common values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights are the basis for deepening our relations. This is a statement we jointly made with Kazakhstan in 2009, and we stand by it. Therefore, we maintain our position that the success of negotiations on the new agreement will be influenced by the advancement of political reforms and fulfilment of Kazakhstan’s international commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we are concerned about the recent developments and the overall slow progress of political reform in Kazakhstan, including the limited implementation of international commitments. According to independent observers from the OSCE, both the early presidential and early parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012 fell short of meeting democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time since Kazakhstan’s independence, we have seen considerable social tension, including a number of terrorist attacks. The strike of oil workers that started in May 2011 culminated in violent clashes with the police in December 2011, resulting in 17 dead and about 110 injured. To cope with evolving security challenges and threats, the Kazakh Government has amended a number of laws over the past few months. It has introduced changes that seem to empower the state more and more, while restricting the rights and freedoms of citizens, civil society and political opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vice-President/High Representative received several questions from honourable Members of the Parliament about these developments and about the EU’s approach, opinions and actions taken. She and her service are actively following the situation in Kazakhstan. Over the past 11 months, there have been more than 10 statements issued by Catherine Ashton herself, and by the EU, at the OSCE Permanent Council. On 17 December 2011, immediately after the violent clashes, the High Representative’s spokesperson published a statement expressing concerns, calling for immediate investigation of the events and a peaceful solution to the situation of the striking oil workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European External Action Service and the EU Delegation in Astana have maintained regular contacts with the authorities, calling on Kazakhstan to uphold its international obligations and commitments, in particular, regarding freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly. The Prosecutor General’s Office in Kazakhstan is carrying out an investigation, and the EU has requested that this process be thorough, transparent and not used to target any specific group or intimidate the Kazakh opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 February, the Vice-President/High Representative met with the Kazakh Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Kazykhanov, where she expressed her concerns and raised specifically the issue of the arrest of a number of opposition activists, including Mr Kozlov, leader of the Alga opposition movement and Mr Vinyavski, an independent journalist. As a follow-up, on 9 February, the EU Delegation in Astana carried out a démarche, asking for information on the health of Mr Kozlov and access to him for his wife and lawyer. As a result, the EU Delegation visited Mr Kozlov in a military hospital in Almaty where he had undergone surgery. The EU Delegation was able to confirm that he had not been ill-treated and that his surgery was due to a previously existing health issue, which was not an urgent matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s efforts and communication with the authorities, notably, the cases discussed in the regular human rights dialogue with Kazakhstan, also yielded results. The jailed human rights activist, Mr Zhovtis, was granted amnesty and released in February 2012. The trade union lawyer, Natalya Sokolova, who was sentenced to six years due to her role in the strikes, was also released, on 7 March, and her sentence was replaced by a three-year conditional sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has several times expressed its readiness to provide support to Kazakhstan for reforms and for the investigation of the events in December, as well as to address the underlying socio-economic problems that led to tensions in the country to begin with.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is funding several projects that are already tackling issues that contribute directly to the improvement of the social, economic and political situation. These include projects on regional development, public service reform and modernisation, support for judicial and legal reform, for local governance and for civil society development, as well as several projects relating to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting and supporting reforms in these areas, and further establishing relevant actors, are priorities both for civil society and the Kazakhstani authorities, at both central and regional levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect that the perspective and negotiation process of the new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will provide a stimulus for Kazakhstan to make more progress, notably in enhancing freedom of expression and freedom of association and encouraging real political pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">To motivate progress, we foresee including fundamental political and economic reform commitments in the new agreement, including aligning regulations to EU norms and standards, and essential political clauses on human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan’s commitments to these fundamental principles will be a strong and clear expression of its will to step up political and economic reforms. WTO accession would also be a clear expression that the country is taking economic transition seriously and is ready to commit to multilateral rules and would show that Kazakhstan is willing to bring increased legal certainty to our relations. This is in the interest not only of Kazakhstan, but also of the EU and the wider international community.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, by no means, a simple process. We are only at the beginning of these important negotiations. However, we are determined to ensure that the European Union continues to stand alongside the Republic of Kazakhstan and its citizens, both as a friend and a partner, on the path of political reform and economic development. In this endeavour, we count on the support of the European Parliament and we look forward to the resolution that you will adopt tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you that just now, Kazakhstan is very open and we must use this situation and use the leverage and power of the European Parliament to put pressure on Kazakhstan to enhance the human rights situation in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, since last year, we have witnessed not only an increase in civil protest and peaceful resistance, but also a decline in fundamental and human rights. This decline is the key word. It is not going better but it is in decline. We are concerned to see an increase in harassments, intimidation and detention of opposition leaders, of independent media persons and other civil actors. In a joint resolution, which I hope will be accepted tomorrow, we urge the Kazakh authorities to reverse the negative trend in human and fundamental rights and to understand that economic cooperation must go hand in hand with political cooperation and the improvement of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">These are both very important – economic cooperation and human rights. That is why it is important for the Kazakh authorities to understand that we expect Kazakhstan to show some positive actions during the PCA negotiation. Therefore, a truly positive action Kazakhstan could take immediately is to fully implement its adopted national human rights action plan. In fact, Kazakhstan could be one of the happiest countries in Central Asia. Economically, it has become a wealthy country but socially and politically, however, it still has to live up to its international commitments and to allow democratic involvement and participation of the citizens in social, political and labour issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we Europeans wish for Kazakhstan to become a true forerunner for such a ‘spring’ in central Asia and we need to use our leverage in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that not only Kazakhstan, but the whole of Central Asia, should represent a strategic partnership for the European Union, because we cannot speak only about human rights, but also about social rights, and this should be of particular concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to welcome the start of negotiations for this partnership and cooperation agreement, because I never had the cynicism to simply criticise, and instead I understood, as a politician, the need to get involved in order to change things. In my opinion, this seems to be the way to follow in an active foreign policy action of the European Union. Under this agreement, the issues related to human rights must be a priority. However, we cannot fail to sanction the major deviations from democracy we are facing in Kazakhstan. I also welcome the release of Natalya Sokolova, but I request, in particular, the release of the opposition leader, Mr Kozlov, and of the leader of one of the most notable media authorities, the editor-in-chief, Igor Vinyavski. They are not the only leaders who are facing unjust and unfair trials at present, under a law aimed at national security in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the main signal that Kazakhstan’s leaders want to democratise their country and ensure a future destined for its citizens lies in the way they address fundamental rights and freedoms. It is vital to re-examine that national security law because it is the source of these oppressions and this should not be tolerated. We cannot consider freedom of speech a violation of a law that concerns national security. No concept of national security in the world can violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these developments should determine our position on upgrading the partnership with Kazakhstan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kazakhstan plays an important stabilising role in this strategic region of the world, and the Kazakh authorities attach great importance to relations with the European Union.

<p class="contents">We think, however, that we should be careful in our judgment of these events, since we do not know all the facts about what took place. The European Parliament’s resolution must not turn into an indictment, particularly when it is not supported by evidence. I think we should appeal to the authorities in Kazakhstan to provide a full explanation of these tragic events, to punish those who are found to be guilty and to exonerate those who are innocent, but in this situation, we must not charge the Kazakh authorities and we must not take over their role.

However, this regression – seen, for example, in the brutal crackdown in Zhanaozen, which saw at least 17 people killed – did not prevent the German Government from signing a lucrative trade deal for rare earths this February. Here we have an example of fine words about human rights not matched by actions, particularly when it comes to vested economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us have some action here and ask the Vice-President/High Representative’s representative to give a clear commitment that the negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will be suspended until there is meaningful change and until all political prisoners, including Vladimir Kozlov and human rights defender, Vadim Kuramshin, have been unconditionally released, and all trumped-up charges and investigations against the 43 strikers and their supporters awaiting trial – and the leaders of the political opposition – have been dropped, including those against Ainur Kurmanov, leader of the Socialist movement in Kazakhstan, and the leader of the independent trade union ‘Zhanartu’, Esenbek Ukteshbaev. It is those who gave the order to shoot down peaceful protestors who should be in the dock, not these opposition activists.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Natalya Sokolova’s release from prison, but all charges against her must be dropped and there must be no restrictions on her trade union activity. The Kazakh Government is suggesting that they have learnt lessons, but actions speak much louder than words, and their actions suggest that the crackdown on workers’ rights and democratic rights is continuing and going even further. For example, February’s amendments to the labour code allow the dismissal of workers involved in strike action, makes it easier to dismiss trade union representatives during strike negotiations, and legalises lock-outs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the general prosecutor’s office has insufficiently accounted for the role of the state forces in the events in Zhanaozen, and the number of people who died according to that report is massively disputed by eyewitnesses. An independent, international inquiry is still desperately needed. If I am granted a visa, I will be travelling to Zhanaozen as part of a delegation of trade unionists, human rights activists and journalists to try and help bring out the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">En passant</span>, the Kazakh authorities are flagrantly violating the fundamental right of religious freedom.

Searches of the houses of defenceless Christian citizens, confiscation of their property, all without any legal grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the murky backdrop to the compulsory re-registration of religious groups. Harassment of house churches, including huge fines for their leaders, completes the factors raising the spectre of religious persecution in Kazakhstan. That is the reality, Council and Commission.

The government and the authorities there are never to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">It was probably on account of international pressure and the fear of country-wide strikes that Kazakhstan changed the sentence imposed on the lawyer who gave legal advice to the striking oil workers from a prison sentence to a suspended sentence. In this regard, we should not forget that the arrest itself should never have happened in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to remember the activists and oil workers who are still awaiting trial. The fact that police officers, who, according to video footage, killed fleeing striking workers by shooting them in the back, can probably expect only mild punishments is also worthy of criticism. A full investigation of the incidents will probably only be possible by an independent international commission of inquiry. The only right and proper step can be to put an end to the violence against activists and to return to an open dialogue.</p>

Kazakhstan is our most important partner in the region, from both a political and an economic point of view. Since the start of the negotiations on an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which I very much welcome, and following the regrettable events in the Zhanaozen district and in connection with the parliamentary elections, we have now focused particular attention on Kazakhstan. I expressly support a close and open dialogue with Kazakhstan in order to enhance our relations. It is crucial that we pay tribute to Kazakhstan’s positive development in the areas of democratisation, human rights and the rule of law, even if, from our Western point of view, these only represent small steps and we rightly expect more progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to see the willingness of the Kazakh authorities to deal with the events in Zhanaozen. In a mutual exchange, including with non-governmental organisations and representatives of Kazakh civil society, we were able to build up a comprehensive picture. The constructive dialogue between governmental and non-governmental representatives around a table in this way with us parliamentarians in Parliament was groundbreaking. The resolution should support this positive development. From this point of view, I think a postponement would also have been sensible, in order to wait and see what the investigations bring to light and so that we would then have clearer conditions for our position, which we do not really have at the moment. That is the position of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and I stand by that, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is the direction it took following the elections in May 2011 when Nursultan Nazarbayev became President again. For a long time, Kazakhstan had been very different to other countries in Central Asia: it was more tolerant and more secular than other countries in the region and ahead of them in terms of both its economic progress and its openness. Sadly, what we have witnessed lately are attacks on freedom of opinion and thought, politically motivated courts, many political prisoners, and the brutal shooting of demonstrating workers in the town of Zhanaozen.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore convinced that we cannot renege on such things as democracy, human rights and the very fact that these are non-negotiable just because here we are talking about an important and rich country with economic potential. I therefore want to add that the thing that shocked me was that, for instance, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the People’s Party was arrested as soon as he returned from Strasbourg, after the plenary session during which he met me and my other colleagues. It seems to me that until these people are released, until they are no longer considered <span class="italic">incommunicado</span>, as they are currently, then there can be no talk of the government becoming more aware of what is going on or of some concessions that we would make. Either the political prisoners and dissidents are released or we have to issue a very severe warning and respond even more harshly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I find it completely unacceptable that, following his recent meeting here in Strasbourg with MEPs to discuss the tragedy in Zhanaozen, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the opposition political party, Alga, was arrested by the Kazakh Committee of National Security on his return to the country. Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think we should call on the Kazakh authorities to end the clampdown on the political opposition and independent media in the country and to immediately release all people incarcerated on politically motivated grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, Kazakhstan is a country with which we can pursue a rational policy, on condition that the Union is consistent and remains true to its values. The borderline is always the same. If the people we know in Kazakhstan – our friends – are in prison, if force is being used, we cannot treat this situation as if it were normal. It seems to me, however, that Kazakhstan today needs to be given a chance, not just by the European Union, but in this case together with the United States. I have the impression that the Kazakh Government is still ready to accept such a proposal, but for this to happen, we need to speak in unison. The borderline we have set – where there are arrests and where force is used – is one we cannot cross. However, we can make an offer, the price of which is freedom for the media and preparations for free elections, elections which will one day take place in Kazakhstan, just as they do in any other country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development of democracy is a long-term affair, requiring first of all the establishment of the rule of law as a foundation. The Kazakh leadership is striving for this, and on the basis of my discussions with Kazakh citizens, I can say that they value the fact that Kazakhstan is an oasis of stability and secular values in Central Asia. That is the first point. Secondly, I can say that even though this is undoubtedly a state where rather authoritative forms of governance prevail, Kazakhs nonetheless value their President, and this can be seen from the fact that they have now got a per capita GDP level of USD 9 000, compared to USD 400 in 1991 when Kazakhstan started out as an independent state. I think it will be some time before this country can be compared to European countries, or the EU, but I believe that they are on their way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I met the victims’ families and offered expressions of the deepest sympathy on behalf of the European Parliament. I met most of the prosecutors who are leading the investigation, and I met regional leaders, the new municipal authorities, independent non-governmental organisations and representatives of independent media. I would like to thank the Polish Embassy for this visit, but also the Kazakh Embassy, which made many of the meetings possible, and I would also like to thank the independent opposition for the meeting I had with them.</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons can be learned from this? Well, we have the assurance of the Kazakh authorities that they will explain the circumstances of the tragedy in which innocent people were killed, and also that they will explain the circumstances of the tragic beatings inflicted on people who have been arrested. We have their assurances that these investigations will be conducted. We also have assurances about transparent, objective trials for those who have been arrested, among whom we are most concerned about Mr Kozlov, Mr Vinyavskiy and Ms Amirova. This is very important. It seems to me that we should continue to monitor the situation concerning transparency. I would also like to say that I see this visit and this situation as a further step in democracy, but there is no democracy in Kazakhstan if truly objective trials are not given to those who have been arrested, and, in particular, to Mr Kozlov, Mr Vinyavskiy and Ms Amirova. I think Kazakhstan is taking a test of its democracy today. In my opinion, this democracy will be expressed by free media, by a free opposition and by a relaxation of certain restrictive laws which are in force today in Kazakhstan.</p>

However, the arrests of opposition members and journalists working for free media which were made following the events of Zhanaozen have given rise to serious doubts. Today, as a consequence, after meetings at the highest level with representatives of the regional and local authorities and prosecutors, I see a certain openness. However, I do think that today, we are going to have to test this information and the promises made by the authorities. In my opinion, the test of full democracy will be the trials of the people we are speaking about today, and I think it is in Kazakhstan’s interest to provide an objective explanation of the situation, but it is also in Kazakhstan’s interest to allow more space for the opposition and free media. We have to monitor this, and we have to show that democracy develops through certain stages and that in Kazakhstan, it needs to be extended further, along European lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that Kazakhstan should not punish its citizens, for example, if they visit the European Parliament, as in the case of Mr Kozlov.

Recent events in connection with the strike by oil workers, when 16 people were killed and members of the opposition imprisoned, demonstrate that we must insist on our values in our contact with Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2010, Kazakhstan held the chairmanship of the OSCE. Membership of an organisation like the OSCE also carries obligations and it means that the common values and rules must be respected. Nevertheless, the OSCE reported that the parliamentary elections in January did not meet international election standards.</p>
<p class="contents">After everything that has happened since December 2011, it is clear that there is a need to build trust between the people in Kazakhstan. This will not be possible, however, if we do not investigate where the responsibility lies with regard to the strike, nor will it be possible if we do not ensure that there is respect for the principles of the rule of law, that legislation is implemented, that there is respect for international regulations and values and if we do not strengthen the position of non-governmental organisations in society.

Their legitimate demands for social justice and better lives were met with bullets. Not less worrying is the fact that, right after the parliamentary elections in January won by the ruling Nur Otan party with 80% of the votes, opposition leaders and journalists were detained. It seems that every effort was made to silence critical voices.</p>
<p class="contents">I am encouraged that some limited steps have already been taken in response to criticism: for example, the release of Natalya Sokolova last week, and of other activists who should not have been detained and convicted in the first place.</p>

The investigation must examine the responsibilities of the authorities, including the alleged torture of arrested demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The confrontations in Zhanaozen arose from the growing wave of government oppression of the independent press, opposition political parties and civil society. The European Union has to remind the Kazakhstan authorities that the new cooperation agreement cannot progress without credible political reforms that make the democratic rule of law a reality in that country, regardless of the strategic importance of the economic and military interests at stake. The reforms must include the freeing of human rights campaigners and political prisoners, such as Vladimir Kozlov, who was detained after a visit to the European Parliament and whose wife is, at this moment, the target of threats and intimidation for attempting to defend the rights of her husband. He has to be freed as soon as possible and, at the very least, has to be allowed visits by his wife and the lawyers he has selected. The state of his health is a concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The European External Action Service must continue to monitor this and other cases, linking the negotiations on the future cooperation agreement to the freeing of political prisoners and effective progress with regard to press freedom, employment rights and other basic human rights such as the right to an independent judiciary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few weeks after the resolution on a strategy for Central Asia was adopted here in this House, which sought to censure the states of Central Asia, we are now responding to events in connection with strikes in Zhanaozen in Kazakhstan without waiting for the outcome of the ongoing investigations that are being carried out with international involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regrettable as the deaths are and as much as those who were injured and imprisoned during the course of these events have the right to a review of what happened, the reasons behind these events remain unclear. Thus, Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the unregistered opposition party, Alga, stated that ‘it was a different group of people; the unrest was by no means in the interests of those who were striking, as it merely provided a reason for violence to be used against them’. The Central Asia expert, Arkady Dubnov, also said: ‘It cannot be ruled out that elements of the Kazakh opposition who live abroad will also get involved. On the other hand, maintaining the tensions could be very much in the interest of someone in the Kazakh capital, Astana. After all, Kazakhstan’s power elite are already fighting for the chance to become President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s successor’.</p>
<p class="contents">We had the opportunity here in Parliament to speak with the Kazakh opposition in the presence of the Kazakh ambassador. The UN Special Representative stated today that he is impressed by the attention that the Kazakh Government is giving to the events in Zhanaozen and that it is necessary to uncover the true facts behind the unrest. We ought to take the Kazakh authorities at their word and measure them by their actions, but we should not make premature, reflex judgments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The democratisation of Kazakhstan is certainly a slow process. This is only the beginning for Kazakhstan, on the way to further democratisation and approximation with European values and standards, and equally in the field of human rights and the development of democratic standards. The country needs to invest considerable efforts and political will in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Kazakhstan will justify the expectations of its European partners, will heed the criticisms levelled today, and will try to take the necessary action. It has recently been invited to join the Venice Commission and is about to receive the status of ‘Partner for Democracy’ in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The citizens of Kazakhstan deserve better human rights standards, the rule of law and a democratic future – in other words, a much better future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a country of great economic opportunities, a partner in economic exchange with Europe. The recent huge contracts concerning the search for natural deposits in Kazakhstan should be mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, we also know it is a country whose recent elections have attracted criticism from the OSCE, which Kazakhstan was leading at the time, and here we are also concerned by the lack of full democracy and, in particular, the failure to respect the rights of the opposition, human rights and the rights of journalists. For many years, the opposition party Alga has not been able to achieve registration – why not? The party’s leader visited the European Parliament, and when he returned, he was arrested. He has undergone an operation, and his wife is being denied contact with him. On the other hand, we also have reports of journalists who have been arrested. There is, in fact, a whole list of these activists – both public activists and opposition journalists – who are at this moment in prison. This is the basic standard we expect – freedom for opposition activists, and freedom for journalists – and when these things are achieved, they could then be a basis for a constructive dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several measures are essential in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the irregularities reported by OSCE/ODIHR on the occasion of elections in January must be investigated.

However, there are still too many other people being held in custody and awaiting trial. We insist that the authorities keep their word that these trials will be fair and just.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back to the question of a realistic policy again. Of course, we are aware that high standards of democracy are not achieved in a very short space of time; they are not achieved in a flash. However, to ensure that this process moves forward in Kazakhstan at a reasonable pace, the authorities there have to know that future EU-Kazakh relations, including economic relations and the benefits the Kazakhs expect to receive from the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, also depend on how quickly improvements are introduced in the field of human rights and political reforms in Kazakhstan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those who have followed events in Kazakhstan in the last few years have had the opportunity to appreciate the steps taken to improve social dialogue, workers’ rights, the independence of the judiciary and the development of democracy. We were therefore struck by the deaths in December and would like to express our sincere condolences to the victims and our hope that the facts will be established, the true facts. We are talking about a country where there are still a lot of open wounds left by the Soviet Union, and we are aware of the difficulties the government of Kazakhstan faces in governing such a vast area midway between the two worlds of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a long way to go, but we believe that in this Parliament, there are some specific groups that intentionally ignore what is happening in our partner countries, such as China and India, where international law and the respect for market rules come second to their economic and electoral priorities, while we focus our criticisms on countries that are trying to make progress in developing democracy. Their progress may be slower than we would wish, but it must be helped and not hindered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should also consider where this country is coming from. Circumstances are not continuing to improve for the people in all of the countries in the region. Not all of them have freedom of religion or respect for minorities, for example. However, Kazakhstan has nevertheless achieved this, and that is also something we should remember.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not simply measure Kazakhstan by European standards, and we must take into account the situation in the region as a whole. Obviously, human rights violations must not simply be ignored, that goes without saying. However, I think this situation is not just black and white; there are also shades of grey, and we have experienced a good level of cooperation with the Kazakh authorities, the ambassador and the public prosecutor in recent weeks, including in the Central Asia Delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should simply help the Kazakh Government on its way to democratisation and demand this democratisation, and I think the partnership agreement that is to be negotiated is a good way to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The events of December 2011 should, however, encourage us to monitor the political developments in the country more closely, so that we can better formulate our views in the talks on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that is under preparation. The requirement of stronger commitments by Kazakhstan, adherence to human rights and religious and political freedoms, as well as structural and economic reforms, should therefore be an important part of negotiations on the new agreement with the European Union, and where there are problems in adhering to these commitments, we should be consistent in drawing the attention of our Kazakh friends to those problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to reiterate that Kazakhstan is an important partner for the EU for very many reasons. However, it is clear that we also have misgivings with regard to current developments and the slow progress of the political reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is necessary to emphasise that President Nazarbayev is well aware of what we stand for. It is precisely because he knows what we stand for that he has chosen to cooperate with us. This, in particular, gives us the opportunity to mention our concerns as well as how we can contribute to helping Kazakhstan develop in the way that we would like it to. We will obviously make it clear what we expect of Kazakhstan as a condition for the conclusion of a new trade agreement. It is very important for us to take this opportunity, in particular, to emphasise our clear expectations. This means that we are, of course, willing to cooperate with Kazakhstan in these matters. It means that the negotiations are an important tool for us, both to strengthen relations and to emphasise the need, and provide an incentive, for reforms, both economic and political, as well as reforms in the area of human rights in the broadest sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now answer the question of what role we see Kazakhstan playing in the region. It is clear that Kazakhstan can play a very important role in the whole of Central Asia. It did so in 2010 in connection with Kyrgyzstan and the unrest there. Thus, we consider Kazakhstan to be a country that will help to stabilise the situation in the region. We believe it is possible to establish even better regional cooperation in Central Asia, and that, in this context, Kazakhstan will play a very significant role, which is something to which we also want to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take away with me what I have heard in this debate. We must use our presence to develop democratic standards and an even stronger strategic partnership. We must also utilise the negotiations because it is these negotiations that will give us the opportunity to initiate a debate, including concerning the values that the EU stands for and that Kazakhstan is obviously familiar with, and that the country wishes to work with us to achieve. We also have an EU delegation in Astana that is providing practical assistance in all of these areas.</p>

In view of the geopolitical situation of Kazakhstan, a country which has had a difficult past, but which is trying to introduce precisely these principles, we should continue to stress the seriousness of the situation in Zhanaozen, but should also remember that Kazakhstan is the country with the most dynamically developing European standards in Central Asia. I would like to point out that Kazakhstan is, for us, a strategic partner, and that it is making every effort to develop our bilateral relations. Kazakhstan’s successful chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has shown that it is able to rise to formidable challenges. I think that as we develop our relations and cooperation further we should take account of the specific nature of the region and the very complicated relationships with which we are dealing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
