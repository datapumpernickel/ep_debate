<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pittella (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report that takes a snapshot of a problem, identifies a risk and outlines some solutions. The problem is the outstanding commitments, this gap that is still too wide between commitments and payments, as regards both the Structural Funds and other fields, too. Outstanding commitments are a composite phenomenon: some are physiological whereas others are pathological, and it is on the latter that action needs to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk is not just the loss of Structural Funds by the regions to which they are assigned; a greater risk is the loss of credibility for cohesion policy within the European Union. We firmly believe that the Union, and the enlarged Union to an even greater extent, needs an effective, consolidated, modern cohesion policy. The solutions we have outlined, on which we seem to have a good understanding with Mr Barnier, who has always been open to dialogue and debate, can be split into two groups: short-term and medium-term solutions. The former include, in particular, the solution of adjusting the level of the payments entered in the budget. Of course, this provision of resources must go hand in hand with a more effective working partnership between the Commission and governments, between governments and regions, and between regions and subregional and local entities. Moreover, the work of monitoring the new Member States, something that is already being done by the Commission, urgently needs to be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards medium-term solutions, the Commission should promptly present its guidelines on the regulation governing the next programming period so that future objectives and implementing arrangements can be laid down in a clear and readily comprehensible form. To this end, we believe the following approach will be necessary: firstly, stressing the Commission’s key role, which ought to be focused on defining development priorities, on the consistency of operations with those priorities and on monitoring the effectiveness of implementing systems, while responsibility for implementing and managing operations should be devolved to the Member States; secondly, being straightforward, clear and precise, and, in connection with this simplification objective, it would therefore appear vital to combine the funds and entrust management of the single fund to a single Commission department; thirdly, provide for programming arrangements to be decided upon in the context of a partnership between the Commission and the Member State concerned; fourthly, give the monitoring committee a greater role, so that decisions on the programme and programme changes can be taken over by the monitoring committee; and, lastly, maintain the incentive measures for effective implementation of operations, such as the n+2 automatic decommitment rule and the reserve for rewarding positive performance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by addressing the automatic decommitment issue. 31 December is nearly here and there is a new deadline. We believe the rule should still be retained for the next few years, since there is no doubt that it has had a major deterrent effect. It is true, however, as Commissioner Barnier has pointed out, that in many situations regions and national governments have adopted a number of devices in order to certify 100% expenditure and avoid losing the funds. We call on Commissioner Barnier to exercise the strictest surveillance on this issue and we invite him in the meantime to prevent resources released through so-called ‘side projects’ from being spent on anything other than the regional and national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude with an example: if the Italian Government – to speak of my home country – receives transport funds to carry out transport infrastructure work in southern Italy and then, after releasing resources through side projects, passes that saving on to infrastructure work in the north, we should intervene to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Parliament will grant this report a very broad consensus, since that would give the approaches it contains great political credibility.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you, Mr Pittella, for the quality of the dialogue that you have established – again uncompromisingly, with each person in their role – not only with the Commissioner responsible for regional policy but also with my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that you have just presented is the fruit of that dialogue, which took place both in the context of the Committee on Budgets and of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, both of which I am always happy to attend, as you kindly said. I was very pleased to hear you presenting your report from a dual perspective, both historical – I will say a few words about settling the past – and looking forward. You also stressed, almost more so, through your proposals and ideas regarding future regional policy, the need to learn both from the most distant past and also the most recent past.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that at the end of 2003 we are at a crossroads where we need to firstly settle the previous period, 1994-1999, using certain methods and regulations, secondly manage the current 2000-2006 period in the best way possible, using other methods and regulations, and thirdly prepare for the future period based on the proposals that the Commission makes at the end of this year in the third report on cohesion, using other methods and regulations. This is why, Mr Pittella, what you are suggesting and recommending will, I promise you, be very useful for this report on cohesion and for preparing for the new period.</p>
<p class="contents">In the text that you presented, you stress two important issues. The first question is: why is there an under-execution of payments under the Structural Funds this year and what will be the payment appropriations requirements for 2004? You mentioned the second question earlier: what are the foreseeable effects of the n+2 rule and what measures should be implemented to simplify it in the future cohesion policy after 2006?</p>
<p class="contents">To add to the speeches that I already made last month on the 2004 budget and in May, before the Committee on Budgets, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give some answers to these two major issues, based on three points:</p>
<p class="contents">The first point: where are we today? Budget execution worked correctly in 2003 despite some unforeseen events. With regard to the current planning period, our efforts at simplification are beginning to bear fruit. It has been possible to make the payments more quickly than before: EUR 12 billion at the end of August, compared with only 9.6 billion in August 2002, which represents real progress from one year to the next. However – once again I will be frank, because I am in the habit of saying what I think and see – for the 1994-1999 period, in other words the first period, the closure operations are progressing slowly, too slowly, and we are faced with an excess of appropriations. The Member States sent their files at the very last minute, in January, February and often even in March, with the last deadline being on 31 March, and I am sorry to say that it is taking longer than foreseen to examine all of these files, of which there are several thousand. This issue of the closure of programmes for the 1994-1999 period is therefore essential for what we call the ‘outstanding commitments’ or RAL.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point: faced with this situation, what can we do and what should we do? My aim, Mr Pittella, ladies and gentlemen, is still to reduce these ‘outstanding commitments’ as much as possible by the end of 2003, and we are going to continue to reduce them from both ends. Today I also sent you, Mr Pittella, and the Committee on Budgets, some information demonstrating the size of this reduction, on the one hand by cancelling commitments that should not give rise to a payment – release of appropriations is already being prepared – and, on the other hand, by actually and genuinely executing payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Will this be enough to deal with all the appropriations available in the 2003 budget? I do not think so. This is why the Commission is soon going to put forward an amending budget in order to cancel part of these appropriations. With regard to the 2004 payment appropriations, I am not going to go back over in detail what I said to you last month, but simply point out that our approach is prudent given the experience of previous years. Nevertheless, if the payment appropriations were insufficient due to a faster execution than foreseen for the 2000-2006 period and a legacy from the 1994-1999 period, the Commission would naturally suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted in passing your particular concern regarding good execution of appropriations in the new Member States for 2004-2006, a concern that I entirely share. I would also like to note that this depends on good planning, which will only be successful if the budgetary authority provides us with the human resources that we have requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pittella, like you, I am very concerned that this good planning should succeed and that appropriations should be well utilised in the new Member States in 2004-2006, which is a very small period: two and a half years. A few days ago I met with the Ministers of Finance of these ten countries plus Bulgaria and Romania. I met with them again yesterday in Rome along with the Ministers from the current countries. I am even going to add something very important to prove that I am in full agreement with you. I think that the accession of these countries, and therefore the success of enlargement, is currently based on rules, laws and regulations that are still a little restrictive. However, in most people’s minds, the success of the accession in the first few years is based on the success of the cohesion policy, on the fact that we will be capable, with the authorities of those countries, of using the money available, which is significant because we are talking about EUR 22 billion for cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Third point: what can we do together, collectively? In the immediate future, we need to maintain and even improve the circulation of information between us. Mr Pittella, I am absolutely in favour of the <span class="italic">monitoring</span> that you propose, although there are some arrangements that we need to discuss. My intention is also to continue to be transparent. This is why you will be regularly informed, with updates several times per year, of the progress of three parameters: forecasts regarding the application of the n+2 rule, which I hope to maintain for the next period, forecasts for execution by the Member States, and finally, the progress of closure of the 1994-1999 programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by stressing how appealing this cooperation is for me and for the Commission as a whole. As we are preparing to adopt, as I said earlier, and submit to you the third report on economic, social and territorial cohesion, it is clear, as you have constantly pointed out yourselves, that good execution of the Structural Funds and Community initiatives is one of the conditions required for this ambitious policy that we wish to preserve and revive to be credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I will use your formula, Mr Pittella, of pathological RALs, which are different from physiological RALs. Like you, I am very concerned with this credibility, which relies largely on our capacity to utilise the money available, to show that we need it and to prove that it has been used effectively. To go a little further in my answer, over and above the comments that you made, which I will probably largely repeat in the draft regulations, the idea that we have of the future cohesion policy is that it should be more focused on the objective of convergence and competitiveness for Objective 1 and the Cohesion Funds and entirely focused on the ambitions of Lisbon and Gotenborg for Objectives 2 and 3, in other words more generally qualitative and decentralised for the other regions that are not the most behind in development.</p>
<p class="contents">I will repeat your idea, which I agree with, Mr Pittella, that during the next period, the Commission should be able to concentrate on its strategic objective and also that the Member States and regional authorities should be given more responsibility for management. This requires a better sharing of financial responsibility, but you also made comments and suggestions on this point, which we are going to look at during the very last weeks of preparation of the third report on cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pohjamo (ELDR),</span></span>   – <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – (FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, for the fundamentally important work he has done with regard to this pressing issue. I was glad to see that the report takes a very similar line to that of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the problem of outstanding commitments in respect of the Structural Funds. Many of the issues contained in our committee’s opinion have also been included in the report. The rapporteur has taken creditable account of factors that impact on the system, dealt with problematic issues critically, and proposes solutions with regard to the delays. In my opinion, the most important of these are the simplification and clarification of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural Funds payments have piled up to an alarming extent. The main procedure for controlling this trend in the current term is the n+2 rule. The rapporteur has found a sufficiently rigid and balanced approach to its application. The application of the n+2 rule is now facing its first real test, as payments requested by the end of the year are to be brought to the Commission’s attention and the overall amount will be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s monitoring system and the way it reports to Parliament must be improved. One problem is the inadequate nature of Member State payment claim forecasts. In a system that is decentralised in the way it operates, Member States have an important responsibility for seeing to it that the system works as a whole. In regional policy it is time we switched from the debate on payments to one on the quality and effectiveness of measures. We will have the necessary ingredients for this when we have data based on the mid-term reviews. Above all, there must be a debate on quality and results by the Monitoring Committees at regional level. More reports and less bureaucracy serve as a guiding principle for better regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope somebody explained to them why it is ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… that there are so very few Members in the Chamber. That brings me back to the question of whether it makes sense to be here at this late hour. We few Members of this House here present know what we think. We have exchanged views in lengthy discussions in very in-depth preparatory meetings. It dishonours the rapporteur, who has invested so much zeal in this work, to have his words declaimed shortly before midnight to an almost empty Chamber. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses his report. I am grateful to Mr Pittella for his good cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the problems have been aired, let me draw your attention to just a few points. It is not acceptable for national ministers to rejoice when funds in Brussels are not drawn on. They may well be glad when a few million euros are returned to them and can be used for this or that other purpose, but if that happens, then the Structural Funds, which were set up to benefit the most needy regions in the EU, are failing in their purpose. When we analyse the way funds are administered, we cannot but note with a critical eye the re-emergence of old familiar problems. Although national co-financing creates great problems for some Member States, we have good reasons for wanting to hold fast to the principle of it; we should, on the other hand, abandon excessively complicated and extensive, even sometimes unnecessary requirements in the procedure as a whole. Simplification and clarity, too, can result in stringent and necessary monitoring and even make it easier. This is something for the Commission and the Member States to do. The excessively lengthy planning procedures mean that delays are virtually inevitable. The current state of affairs as regards the outflow of funds is disturbing, but surely no surprise to the actors involved. It will be no simpler after the European Union gains ten new members. That is why there is a need for coordination between the actors to be simplified in order to enable EU funds to be targeted and used in a rational way.</p>

This becomes stranger still in view of the fact that the first objective of structural policy is the sustainable development of the Union. It is quite true that the persistence of high and rising levels of outstanding financial commitments does not necessarily mean that none of the final objectives of cohesion policy can ever be reached. In any case, those objectives must be reached – and fast – so that the lion’s share, at least, of the outstanding commitments does not become lost through the bureaucracy of the institutions or through the political and administrative incompetence of the governments of the Member States. Moreover, the blame can and should be shared by the two decision-making tiers. That is a logical consequence of the disparities in the breakdown of executions between the countries of the Union, and between the different Structural Funds. Rendering regional policy and Structural Fund management more effective, therefore, depends on the right choices being made at national level, but it also stems from regulations and from the elimination of pointless bureaucratic requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, moreover, recognises the Commission’s role in introducing simplifying measures, but also argues that those measures are inadequate and proposes, quite rightly, that they be revised. Furthermore, cohesion policy is on the agenda and the tabling of the Sapir report means that its reevaluation cannot be avoided. Without wanting to pre-empt a separate political debate at this stage, it is important to emphasise that the fastest and easiest way to render political policies superfluous is to make them incomprehensible and impracticable in advance by administering the prescribed dose of bureaucracy and red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, therefore, must urgently enhance and emphasise its strategic function in defining priorities, leaving the responsibility for implementing and managing funds to the Member States. Hence I welcome Mr Pittella’s report, acknowledge its timeliness and support its proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism deal on a regular basis with the monitoring of how the European regional and structural policy is implemented in political and budgetary terms. In all the years in which I have been following this process, one problem has always been pre-eminent, namely that of the hesitant and delayed realisation of the various European programmes, expressed in concrete figures in the RALs.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what Mr Pittella has elucidated in precise terms in his very fine report. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you expect the position with regard to 2003 to turn out better. It is indeed the case that a number of points show improvement, but I ask you to note that, in the year up to 20 September this year, the RALs for Objectives 1 and 2 have increased. INTERREG’s flow of appropriations is overwhelming; Objective 2’s is inadequate. Over and over again, the problems are the same. When it adopted the Berlin agenda for the period 2000-2006, the Commission made a series of changes to the planning, administration and realisation of a whole range of programmes. Today, I believe, we can already see how inadequate those changes were.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social cohesion, one of the cornerstones of EU policy, is already, in an EU with fifteen Member States, exposed to severe strain, let alone what will happen in an EU of twenty-five. If we want to face up to this challenge and retain the solidarity principle, the existing rules will have to undergo fundamental changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the first of these, the economies of most of the Member States are in a crisis situation. The Member States’ budgetary discipline, as demanded by the Stability and Growth Pact, is pro-cyclical in its effects. Governments are restricted as to what they can do to fund national development programmes. Gaps are becoming apparent in their capacity to cofinance, with a consequent increase in the amounts of European funds left unused. Can we draw from this the conclusion that the Member States no longer need the money? No, we cannot. It follows that greater flexibility must be permitted in the Stability Pact both as it relates to investments and to cofinance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although I have always been, and still am, a defender of the ‘n+2’ rule for the current planning period, I urge that it be handled in a more flexible manner, for example, that it be, in exceptional cases, deferred to ‘n+3’ or, indeed, that funds be released to those countries and regions that can guarantee that they will be applied in due time and order. Finance ministers should not be able to celebrate annual injections of billions of euros into their national economies just because EU funds have not been used within the deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, just like the rapporteur, I regard it as necessary to simplify the implementing regulations and those on the transfer of responsibility for the monitoring of funds and their use in an appropriate and flexible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to say what I expect the Commission’s mid-term assessment to include, particularly with a view to a detailed analysis with reference to those countries, regions and programmes that contribute to the problem with unspent funds. With the prospect of Parliamentary elections in 2004, we have to prove to the public that we are capable of using tax revenue properly, efficiently, and in a targeted way. If we fail to do so, we will have lost some of the justification for our own existence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of the ever growing reservoir of commitments outstanding in the framework of Structural Funds policy seems to have become a permanent feature now. The content of the reservoir is no less than EUR 92 billion and therefore approximately equivalent to the whole of the EU budget for a year.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'n+2' rule is a first necessary step in order to reduce the level of this reservoir. However, the ultimate goal is, of course, for this Structural Funds policy to be better aligned to its objectives. This question is even more pressing in the light of the pending enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has tabled a number of proposals which should deal with the problems involved in implementing the policy and make it more effective. A first requirement seems to be to reduce the complexity and cut back on the endless decision-making procedures. A clarification of the rules and improving coordination will equally have a positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have not tackled a number of fundamental problems, though. I would like to mention the fact that an important share of aid still ends up in relatively prosperous regions. The situation in Italy provides very clear evidence of this. The south remains poverty-stricken while the north is immensely rich. And this while Italy’s GDP as a whole is around the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, the Central Planning Office in the Netherlands presented a study identifying the possible causes of the ineffectiveness of Structural Funds policy. In summary, the researchers concluded that the Structural Funds policy cannot be effective until the four conditions have been met. They are, first of all, sound institutional quality; secondly, low inflation; thirdly, transparent and reliable government policy, and fourthly a low level of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sad to say, but remarkably enough, the four largest recipients of funds from the Structural Funds score very badly in terms of the above criteria. Consequently, the institutional quality in those countries will need to be improved as a matter of priority. This also applies to the EU’s future Member States. If not, we will be fighting a losing battle, and a renewed increase in the level of the reservoir would loom from May 2004 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">European policy that aims to promote economic growth in poor regions and narrow the prosperity gap should be more coherent. We would therefore suggest that Structural Funds policy should focus on Objective 1, for which only the poorest regions qualify. Other forms of structural policy, especially those that benefit relatively prosperous regions, very often seem to frustrate labour mobility or lead to distortion of competition. What also happens regularly is that national or regional authorities submit their least effective projects for application for European aid. We should put a stop to the recycling, or transfer, of European funds between the rich Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With its proposals, the Commission has made a start on improvement. However, we need thorough reform, so that the poorer regions can actually make progress. The added advantage is that more coherence and greater clarity in the policy allow for outgoings to be monitored more efficiently. Finally, the Member States will also be able to submit a reliable estimate prior to the drafting of the budget. After all, the reservoir of payment appropriations is mainly the result of excessive levels of commitment appropriations. If we no longer want this reservoir, we will need to tackle the problem at source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It pains me greatly, therefore, to see that as much as EUR 91.6 billion in available funds – or the equivalent of the European Union’s annual budget – has not yet been used. In the run-up to the deadline for the 1994-99 programming period, there were still some 300 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programmes which had made no claims for payment whatsoever. Under the circumstances, such figures verge on the disgraceful. My sole consolation is the knowledge that, of all the Member States, Portugal is one of the best at implementing the Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, for Community support framework II (QSF II), for which complete data have only recently become available, Portugal’s implementation rates are exemplary: 99.6% for the ERDF, 98.3% for the European Social Fund (ESF), 100% for the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund<span class="bold"> </span>(EAGGF) and 90% for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). Portugal’s overall execution rate of 94.2% is significantly higher than those of its European partners. Similarly, the QSF-III for 2000-2006 is still proving very irksome for the European Union. Yet again, the figures for Portugal are on track, according to the mid-term reviews.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of this under-implementation are well-known: long, complex programmes, unreliable payment forecasts and overlapping programming periods. In the face of the large amounts of unused funds, the Council has proposed solutions which, to my mind, err on the side of caution. I am convinced that measures such as these will not yield the results expected of them, and that some of them will even be counterproductive. The Commission should be forced to take responsibility for defining priorities, enhancing the consistency of operations and monitoring implementation, leaving the Member States solely responsible for implementing and managing structural operations. Apart from anything else, this under-execution of the Structural Funds is extremely bad for the image of the European Union among its citizens. Finally, as a citizen of Portugal and a native of the Algarve, I am hopeful that the forthcoming QSF-IV for 2007-2013 will continue to allow the Algarve region to benefit from structural operations, even in the context of an enlarged Europe. If that does not happen, I feel it would be legitimate to call for a fair solution permitting regions such as this, which are ineligible simply due to the effects of the statistical impoverishment of the enlarged European Union, to be assisted in their quest for convergence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My concern deepens given that, as we know, outstanding payments for the years 2000-2006 have now risen to more than EUR 76 billion, thus running the risk of decommitment under the n+2 rule. This is deplorable in view of the high levels of unemployment and poverty pertaining in some Member States, such as Portugal, and the lack of social services and infrastructure, which are essential for social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social cohesion is a central aim of the European Union. For this very reason, the Structural Funds are vital to promoting genuine convergence; they also contribute to redistribution within the Community budget. Failure to execute those funds, therefore, does not merely jeopardise the aim of economic and social cohesion. It also serves to accentuate existing regional inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of this situation, then, must be dealt with, both by resolving bureaucratic problems through simplifying and decentralising measures, and, above all, by eliminating the budgetary constraints imposed by the Stability Pact. That pact must be reviewed, not forgetting that the Structural Funds are even more important in the run-up to the enlargement of the European Union. The policy of economic and social cohesion, then, demands that these procedures be reviewed so that we can effectively benefit from all the funds available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Pohjamo and Mr van Dam pointed out, as did Mr Pittella, that it was important that this new n+2 rule was properly used for the 2000-2006 programme: we noticed at the end of 2002 that it had not caused very significant decommitments. The moment of truth will be at the end of 2003, as many of the regionalised programmes were signed in 2001. Personally, I think that the rules are useful. It is a rule of good management. Like Mr Pohjamo, I also think that the key lies largely in the Member States improving their forecasts. You have stressed this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Glase mentioned over-complicated procedures. I would like to put forward my point of view, and I must say again, as I would say to Mr Markov, that I have to implement these procedures because they are in the regulations, which you are well aware of, which were established at Berlin 2000-2006. I have sought to use all the margins for flexibility in these regulations and I have found some, which you were informed of last year when I met with the Ministers to propose them: we are already seeing some effects of these simplification and flexibility measures. Nevertheless, I cannot act as if these Berlin rules did not exist. I admit that they are complicated. I think that we can simplify them.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of avoiding having to make such observations during the next period – Mrs Glase mentioned planning for too long a period – is to reduce the time of that planning: I agree with this idea. When I became a Commissioner at the end of 1999, I had to implement this new period. What have I been doing for one or two years, practically two years? I have been consulting and planning with the regions and Member States. For the first two years of the programme, we did not use any money, we did not undertake any projects, because the first two years, 2000 and 2001, were used for negotiating the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I have moved the debate forward for the future period and why at the end of 2003 the Commission is proposing its guidelines and new policies for cohesion and its plans for regulation for 2004, is in order to move the whole process forward, and, as long as the governments, the Council and Parliament give their views on the future Agenda, the Financial Perspectives and these policies as soon as possible, we will then be able to use the last year of this 2000-2006 period, 2006, for consultation rather than waiting for the start of the next period.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope that I have – I am again being very cautious – what I am working for, Mr Pittella, ladies and gentlemen, is for us to have clear ideas as to the amount of money available, on the new cohesion policies and the new regulations quite soon in order to be able to devote the whole of 2006 to consultation regarding future programmes and for us to thus be able to undertake programmes and projects from the start of the future period and not two years after the start. That is my aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr dos Santos and Mr Markov mentioned the outstanding commitments. Personally, I say to Mr dos Santos, I have not tried to deny Mr Pittella’s figures: I know these figures well, and I have tried to explain them impartially, because there are explanations. At the same time, along with my colleagues I have endeavoured to gradually reduce this RAL: for example, for the ERDF, the outstanding commitments for the 1994-1999 period were EUR 7 billion at the end of 2002; they will probably be EUR 3.8 billion at the end of 2003. We have therefore reduced them practically by half.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov, I was surprised by one of your comments regarding making the n+2 rule more flexible: you talked about the possibility of n+3. If we go down this road, we risk worsening the utilisation problems and worsening the outstanding commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr van Dam, I am working on simplification for the next period: I want to reduce the number of instruments, I want to reduce the number of planning decisions. I will undoubtedly propose abolishing the zoning of Objective 2. I want to focus the priorities and also base matters on the projects and increase the flexibility and redeployment margins during the period. These are the simplification ideas that we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Dam, I do not, however, share your feelings regarding the results of this Structural Funds policy. I do not think that it is possible to create a map of bad management as rapidly as you did: I know of cases of bad management in countries that have been members of the European Union for a long time and not only in the new countries in the South. I do not think that we can point the finger at any particular country, as in those countries I am seeing an overall effort, even if it is sometimes quite slow, to improve management and control and to modernise administration.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked for the next policy to concentrate on Objective 1, on the regions that are poorest or most behind in their development: that is what we will propose but, nevertheless, I have not decided on removing all European action from the other regions. In the current Member States of the Union, sometimes even in the developed regions, there are real problems linked to industrial relocation, restructuring, poverty, extreme poverty in cities, and the problems of desertification in certain areas of the countryside. I do not think that Europe can be indifferent, that the Union can be indifferent to these problems in the fifteen countries of the current Union, because if the Union is indifferent, if it has to concentrate all of its budget on the new countries plus a few regions in the South, we should not be surprised if the people themselves become indifferent to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole policy that I am aiming at with this reform of the Structural Funds for the future period is focusing and using this policy to serve the broad objectives of solidarity and of the Lisbon and Gotenborg Agenda, making the regions, rather than spectators, the partners in these objectives. In any case, Mr van Dam, I can tell you very clearly that personally, I am in favour of a real reform, sometimes even a radical reform: I will never be in favour of the re-nationalisation of this cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piscarreta mentioned the idea of going further, as did Mr Pittella himself, in entrusting the Member States with management: yes, I am ready to go very far in decentralising management, but naturally, that means that first there must be a better sharing of financial responsibility. As long as the European Commission is practically solely responsible to the budgetary authority, and the Court of Auditors, I am obliged to check, control and ensure that the control systems are correct and are operational. Probably, in the spirit of what is written in the new European Constitution, we will be able to move towards a better sharing of responsibility and therefore towards a greater decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I wanted to say very quickly in response, and to say to Mr Pittella and each of you that I remain prepared to answer all of your questions before your committees and the plenary and to continue this dialogue: we need it, and many of the suggestions made in Mr Pittella’s report will be among the proposals that the Commission will make, particularly in terms of managing the future cohesion period, in the third cohesion report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
