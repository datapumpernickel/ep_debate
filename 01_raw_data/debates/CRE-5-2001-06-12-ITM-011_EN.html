<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission has just – and when I say ‘just’, I mean only ten minutes ago – approved the proposal for a generalised system of preferences for 2002-2004 and has also decided to refer this to Parliament. I am therefore happy to be able to comment on the proposal briefly and to place it in the double context of the common commercial policy on the one hand and the European Union’s strategy on sustainable development and the combating of poverty on the other. The generalised Community’s system of preferences (GSP) actually lies at the intersection between these two major policies of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of you who are familiar with this subject know that the GSP is exclusively a tariff instrument which was created about thirty years ago, following an initiative by the European Community of the time within UNCTAD, the object of which was to reduce customs duties on industrial exports from developing countries, since its principal raison d’être was the industrialisation of the third world. At the time, high rates of duty were the main obstacle to trade. Of course, things have since changed to some extent, because the average level of duty has gone down. On the other hand, the non-tariff barriers have grown in relative importance, and we are trying to deal with this question in relation to non-tariff barriers by giving a certain number of countries the financial resources to enable them to improve their institutional capacity and by concluding ad hoc technical agreements with them, such as mutual recognition agreements or agreements on veterinary or plant-health matters.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that some tariff barriers are still important, even now. I shall quote a few examples. In the textile and agriculture sectors, developing countries often have comparatively large advantages, and there we are retaining tariff protection. In the primary processing sector we still have the combination of zero duty on imported raw materials and significant rates of duty on processed products, those rates corresponding to the degree to which those raw materials have been used. This is known as tariff escalation, and quite rightly, because this method of calculating our tariffs has the effect of discouraging processing on the spot in the country of origin. Then we also have certain tariff peaks which, despite the fact that we have made them less extreme – to a greater extent than they have done in the United States, for example – are still significant in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission is proposing, then, is the updating of the GSP in order to respond to three concerns. First, there is the question of compensating for the erosion in preferential tariff margins which involves lowering the average tariff levels. Then there is the need to simplify the system for tariff modulation, according to how sensitive the products are. We have got rid of some categories. There were four categories before, whereas now there are only two. It is more simple, less complicated. It will make the work of operators and customs officers easier and will thus make it possible to raise the GSP take-up rate.</p>
<p class="contents">The third concern is that we need to carry out a graduation process, in other words to deal with cases in which we are withdrawing the benefits of the GSP from countries with a high GDP, for products in which their competitiveness has been demonstrated by the relative level of their share of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, in these circumstances, these countries can do without the GSP for those products, in which case ‘graduation’ offers new prospects for exports from other, less competitive developing countries, thus giving them a potential advantage in terms of development and the struggle against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We have carried out this updating of the GSP in order to try to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to give a new, positive signal to the developing countries, to show them that we are determined to meet their expectations with regard to access to the market – this is a result of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative (EBA), hence the idea of recreating the preferential margins – and, on the other hand, the tactical ploy of retaining, with a view to the multilateral tariff-negotiations round, opportunities for additional access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all agree that the developing countries generally, and rightly, acknowledge the special value of a concession which is given in a multilateral context, compared with a unilateral preference. The former is certain and stable, while the latter remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a rapid overview of the various GSP arrangements, we can see that there are four of them, the general arrangements, which apply to the countries of Asia and Latin America, the only continents not to benefit from bilateral preferential advantages like those which are reserved for the ACP countries and the Mediterranean countries. In this area, we are respecting the economy in general, restoring the preferential margins, simplifying modulation and applying normal graduation rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The second arrangements are for the least developed countries, which were radically improved by the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative. They are not affected by this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The third arrangements relate to social and environmental incentives, such as allocating additional tariff reductions to those countries which effectively implement the framework conventions of the International Labour Organisation and which undertake to ensure that there is sustainable management of tropical rainforests. These additional tariff reductions have been strengthened, in the Commission’s proposal, in order to correct their current weakness. We have done this, in our proposal, by doubling the preference margin in line with social and environmental commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and last arrangements are the ‘drugs’ arrangements for the countries of the Andean Pact and the countries of Central America. These arrangements have been maintained and extended for a significant period of three years, until 2004. They deserve your special attention because they fit in with the Union’s great ambition with regard to Latin America and, to some extent, the privileged alliance which links us to that continent, but also because the arrangements are the Union’s main contribution to the fight against drugs, in which these countries are both the scene of operations and the protagonists. In my view, we should regard the drugs phenomenon in these countries as a symptom, rather than the cause, of the poor level of development that is endemic to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘drugs’ arrangements are very generous, very similar to the EBA initiative, because they consist in granting access to the Community market, at a ‘zero’ rate of tariff, for the most important industrial and agricultural products of these middle-income countries. When I say ‘middle-income’ I mean with a per capita GDP, at current rates of exchange, of about USD 1 100 for Bolivia, and USD 4 600 for Venezuela, in other words well above the USD 700 per head in the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary objective of the ‘drugs’ arrangements is not to directly replace illegal coca crops, but to promote development for its own sake, to create jobs and to diversify industrial and agricultural production, an area in which these countries are falling behind to an extent which gives rise for concern and which is, in our opinion, one of the factors that encourages the expansion of the production and trafficking of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">We would expect these countries to respond to the special access that we are offering them to the European market by promoting – and in particular European – direct investment, tackling corruption and battling for social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want these countries to do is to make more use of our GSP arrangements, while implementing more effective sustainable development strategies that address the root causes of the economic problems, and drugs and violence. This is the concept of sustainable development, which hinges on job-creating growth, social progress – entailing the effective implementation of ILO framework conventions – and environmental protection, including the sustainable management of the tropical rainforest which is a crucial aspect in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore proposing to our Andean partners the very close monitoring of their efforts with regard to the diversification of their exports, the anti-drugs campaign and the promotion of these social and environmental aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are already somewhat alarmed by this parallel which the Commission is drawing between the generosity of the ‘drugs’ arrangements and the concern to evaluate the economic, social and environmental performance of our partner countries. We must remember that it would be difficult, otherwise, to justify the special nature of the arrangements that specifically apply to Latin America, to which we are linked by a political and economic partnership that is very ambitious compared with our relationship with other countries, and Asian countries in particular, which have a comparable level of development and are also facing the task of combating drugs but do not benefit from the ‘drugs’ arrangements. The only way that we can justify this difference is by subjecting these exceptional tariff preferences to standards of implementation that are acceptable to just those countries sharing our European values on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, as well as being good things in their own right, the encouraging of sound policies, the monitoring that is carried out by the Commission and the resulting dialogue with each country are also the counter-concession which allows the ‘drugs’ arrangements to escape being called into question, even by a WTO panel, on the grounds that it creates unjustified discrimination between countries benefiting from the Community GSP.</p>
<p class="contents">This monitoring is not, therefore, an abusive or offensive intrusion into the internal affairs of these countries. On the contrary, in our view it is a kind of lightning conductor to deflect any complaints to the WTO by other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect that at Doha our Latin American partners will be working in close cooperation with us in order to push ahead with the bilateral liberalisation and standardisation which should consolidate, rather than threaten, the ‘drugs’ GSP arrangements which are specific to the Andean Pact and Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the EBA initiative, this proposal on the new Community GSP, which we are putting forward on the eve of Doha, confirms the priority which the Union intends to give, via the new round, to the integration of developing countries into the world economy, with the aim of achieving a fairer and more sustainable development, and the Commission needs your support in order to achieve this ambitious undertaking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, I believe, an initiative which once again shows far-sightedness and which attempts to solve problems which we all know lie ahead before they even arise. We all know that we can only enjoy success in world trade if we offer products and services which are also actually bought. Hence my question: thanks to trade on the Internet we have now attained a very high level of activity internationally in the small consignments sector. In Europe we have 18 million employers in a labour force of 250 million. Could you envisage our putting in place appropriate measures for individual small consignments up to a certain number of euros, so that this small-scale trade is also able to develop completely freely, without barriers and without excessive bureaucracy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these concerns the nature of the existing obstacles to imports. Broadly speaking, there are two categories of obstacles, customs barriers, whether tariff or quantitative, and more technical barriers. As far as tariff barriers and quantitative barriers and concerned, I believe that, with the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative and with the enhanced GSP which we are proposing now, the developing countries’ access to our market, particularly via modern, electronic means, is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of customs procedures, and in particular the implementation of inspections related to the rules of origin. Inasmuch as we are giving specific customs advantages, as compared with a most-favoured-nation clause, we cannot risk ignoring the existence of rules of origin and therefore of certificates, which require customs procedures. So, on the one hand we are dealing with tariffs, but on the other hand, because we are dealing with tariffs, we need rules of origin and therefore customs procedures, so customs procedures will continue to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should explain that these customs procedures apply subject to exemptions which are conditional upon the value of consignments, and which to some extent transactions via the Internet will not pick up. In other words, as long as you remain below a certain number of exemptions, Internet exports can go ahead without any customs procedures. Beyond that, I think that for the time being, unless we run into any serious and dangerous problems over rules of origin, we should retain a certain number of formalities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a few questions. I was very glad to hear what you said about tariff escalation. Could say a little more about the specific actions that will be undertaken within this new GSP scheme and the particular margins that might be anticipated on that particular issue?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding enhanced GSP that will, hopefully, provide an incentive for improved social and environmental performance, could you say how successful the existing scheme has been, and whether you think a doubling is going to be enough? A doubling sounds very good, but we are starting from an extremely low base. One can always say it is never enough but do you seriously think you have any indications that this is going to attract more people into the scheme than before?</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question about the longer term. Given as you say that the value of GSP is being eroded all the time because of the lowering of tariffs overall, what other mechanisms would you foresee in order to try to strengthen social and environmental performance among different developing countries? The GSP, or its worth, is not going to be there for ever, as tariffs go down across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could you say little more about human rights violations as a whole? The enhanced GSP system obviously works as a system of incentives. Have you had any thoughts about whether it might be necessary to reform the GSP, so that those who are perpetrating human rights violations, Colombia in particular, are actually excluded from the scheme across the board? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regarding the problems of tariff escalation, inasmuch as we are increasing the preference margin, we are reducing, by that amount, the difference caused by tariff escalation. However, and on this point I am absolutely clear, we are not changing the tariff-escalation system to any great extent. There will still be a zero rate for certain products. Tariff escalation comes into play, but its impact is reduced by the preference margin that we are offering.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the generalised system of preferences, from the point of view of its providing an incentive for social and environmental performance, the Commission thought it would be useful to go further, in other words to double the preference already granted, because it shares what I think is the view implied by your question, i.e. that at the moment the scheme has not given rise to many specific projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as social matters are concerned, in our proposal we have introduced an innovation, to the extent that we now refer to the International Labour Organisation as regards what amounts, to some extent, to the certification of the advantages that we are granting. This is an innovation which I would draw to your attention and which has the double effect of making the diagnosis more objective, if I can use that word, and also of giving the ILO a greater profile in this international social governance which is, as you know, one of our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of drugs we have also been innovative, because we have made provision, in the countries which benefit from the GSP, for ‘drug-specific’ monitoring in relation to social conditions and also in relation to environmental conditions. In the case of social conditions, this takes place with reference to the ILO framework conventions, and in the case of environmental conditions it takes place in the context of tropical rainforest management, which more or less coincides geographically with the region in question. Therefore, from this point of view, conditionality via monitoring is increased, and I believe that I was attempting, in this proposal, to bear in mind, as you are doing, certain specific cases in which what was happening on the ground in relation to social rights did not necessarily comply with the spirit of the agreements between the Union and the countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to your last point, as far as preferences are concerned, whether for social performance or environmental performance, have we any alternative? As you know, we took a decision of principle, to the effect that, when taking into consideration social and environmental questions, we should not come down too heavily on the side of sanctions, but opt instead for incentives. We are therefore increasing the incentive here. We are making it clearer and more objective, with reference to a certain number of standards, but we are not coming down on the sanctions side. What we already have in unilateral and bilateral form, where we have greater room to manœuvre, must be translated into multilateral form, though probably in a more diluted form, in the multilateral negotiations in preparation for the Doha round, and you know what the Union’s mandate is there. In view of the fact that the WTO is a multilateral institution, we are obliged to make certain compromises in WTO negotiations which we do not necessarily have to make in bilateral negotiations and which we do not have to make at all when it comes to unilateral measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the problem of human rights violations, we are dealing with this on the basis of the specific ILO conventions, and in particular the convention on forced labour and slavery. This proposal includes temporary withdrawal in the case of slavery or forced labour. This was already included in the previous proposal. We are now adding to it violations of the fundamental social standards covered by the five ILO basic conventions, so on this point we have to some extent added to what was already included and was also, as you know, applied in the case of Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In making them you have already answered part of the first question which I am about to put to you. I should like to come back once more to the system of incentives in the GSP, in the generalised system of preferences, which has of course been extended to social policy and the environment. From what I have heard, this programme – which I consider to be very sensible – has not yet met with the desired response in the countries concerned. At this early stage, and leaving aside the fact that the scheme does not of course impose any negative penalties, do you have any indications why the response has been so poor?</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is: has an assessment been made of the extent to which the large free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, which is of course planned by the USA and within which it is intended to reduce tariffs to zero would – if it ever becomes a reality – impair or stimulate trade with us in particular in the generalised system of preferences? Has the Commission already considered this?</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final question on the WTO: recently it was written that people would actually welcome a decision in Qatar to open a new negotiating round in various sectors. Can you say anything more about this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the first question, the current use of social or environmental incentive clauses, we have so far received four applications with reference to the social incentive clause. These applications are from Moldavia, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia. Of these four applications, one of them, and I believe I am right in saying it was the Moldavian application, was accepted immediately. The others are being examined. It is not a very long list, in fact it is a short list if you think of how many countries could be interested in the scheme in theory.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it not a longer list? In my opinion there are two reasons. The first of these is concerned with a matter of principle: a certain number of developing countries do not, as a matter of principle, wish to make a link between a commercial advantage and the observance of social standards. This is not a unanimous position, nor is it equally firm in every country. The spectrum is relatively broad, but it still poses problems sometimes. We are aware of this, and it is a matter for the countries in question to decide; that is their right, their understanding of the matter, and they are sovereign. We simply believe that, by increasing the margin and the advantage that they might gain from ‘matching’ these criteria, we can perhaps give some countries, who may be hesitating and who may be undecided between economic advantages and matters of principle, a nudge in what we believe to be the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question, the North-South America free trade zone, at the moment negotiations are proceeding between the 34 countries of the American continent. These negotiations have been going on for almost five years and will probably last another five. In the short term, therefore, this is not a problem, and it does not affect the relative advantage that we give to countries in that region under the ‘drugs’ regime, whether in Central America, the Andes region or the member countries of the Andean Pact. In a sense, we are each making a contribution, the United States in various forms, in particular credits and operations, while our contribution is commercial in nature. We each have our own way of doing things and I think that, from that point of view, the negotiations on the North-South America free trade zone will not change anything very much in the short term. In the medium and long term, it will all depend on the level of tariff preference that they achieve, and this is still an unknown factor.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the last question, the prospects in Qatar, as you are no doubt aware, since you are one of the specialists on this subject, we are working flat out, with a number of developing countries, with a view to improving their perception of the advantage that would accrue to them as a result of starting a new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar. We are making quite good progress here. For example, looking at the results of last week’s meeting of APEC trade ministers from countries bordering on the Pacific, we can see that progress has been made on this subject. In addition, we are working, at this very moment, with the new administration in the United States of America, again at full stretch, to try to ensure that the summit between the United States and the European Union which is to take place next Thursday morning, at the European Council in Gothenburg, will be able, on this point, to give a signal that will help to demonstrate that the movement has now been launched. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
