<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sörensen (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report, that is to say, all collaborators, but also the people from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the interpreters, who have worked very hard. This report is also a reaction to the excellent communication by the Committee on new measures to fight trafficking in women. By way of preparing for the report, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities organised a public hearing which involved experts and the presence of a victim who came to give her story. A delegation of this committee, together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, visited a shelter for victims of trafficking in people. Moreover, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Member States and candidate countries received a questionnaire on how they tackle trafficking in women, the results of which will be made available to the European Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">The report primarily aims to fight trafficking in women, but also in children and men, that is to say in people in general. Trafficking in children does exist, but they are used as adults. Men, too, are victims of trafficking in people and are sexually abused. In fact, the sex industry is not the only market on which the victims of such trafficking are sold. In Belgium, 40 percent of the victims end up on the labour market, in the textile, hotel and catering and fruit-picking industries, bakeries and the construction industry, or as house staff or au-pair girls, obliged to work as slaves in degrading conditions. Victims are also recruited for the marriage market, as well as to sports clubs and football clubs. According to estimates by the United Nations and the International Organisation for Migration, the IOM, every year four million people throughout the world fall victim to trafficking, 500 000 of whom end up in Europe. All the signs are there that the number of victims is rising and that the influx from Central and Eastern European countries has exceeded the existing stream from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia. </p>
<p class="contents">In a report by the United Nations, it is stressed that trafficking in people is one of the fastest growing forms of organised crime. The huge profits and relative safety for the perpetrators who generate this type of crime will undoubtedly have something to do with this. The penalties for smuggling narcotics, for example, are far higher than those for trafficking in women. Victims are often unable to speak out on account of the illegal situation they are in. Since there are clear indications that these problems are developing within the framework of international networks, it is important that these problems are addressed and tackled at European level. In order to tackle trafficking in people adequately, we first of all need a clear definition of trafficking in people. Priority must also be given to the fight against organised networks which are not only involved in trafficking in people but which are also involved in all kinds of other criminal activity, such as the trade in narcotics, arms and such like. I therefore applaud the new Community initiatives concerning money laundering where the income from trafficking in women plays a major role. Various initiatives have already been taken at European level. Efforts to increase public awareness have got off to a good start in the form of activities on the part of Interpol and Europol, initiatives in every individual Member State, Habitat projects, etc. However, the harmonisation of the different national legislations in this field and the ensuing discrepancies in methods of investigation and prosecution have to be tackled at European level as a matter of priority. From a survey organised in connection with this report, it is quite clear that there are considerable discrepancies in this sphere between the Member States and between one candidate country and another. Some countries which have strict legislation on prostitution do not even have any legislation at all on trafficking in people. </p>
<p class="contents">By introducing the STOP programme, Europe is striking while the iron is hot, and opportunities for collaboration have opened up. Last year, the Council adopted the DAPHNE programme. This is a new policy tool intended to prevent all kinds of violence – physical, sexual and psychological – against women and children. It is encouraging that, in the first half of this year, the Commission wishes to submit detailed proposals for harmonising criminal legislation in the Member States on trafficking in people with a view to their sexual exploitation and, specifically, proposals for granting temporary residence permits to victims who are prepared to cooperate in the investigations which are necessary if legal action is to be taken against the traffickers. </p>
<p class="contents">Scanning the amendments, I have the impression that some people want to hijack this report, which is about victims of trafficking in people, to start a debate on prostitution. In the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, a clear decision was made to discuss trafficking in women, or forced prostitution, within the framework of this report. A debate on whether or not to ban or legalise prostitution may be pressing, but cannot be held at this point in the interest of the victims of trafficking in people. As I said, trafficking in people is not just about the problem of demand for prostitution. Victims of trafficking in women also find it extremely difficult to re-integrate into their place of origin and even within their own families. Once they have, as victims, worked in prostitution, they are labelled prostitutes for the rest of their lives or, as the saying goes, once a prostitute, always a prostitute. </p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives which have been taken are the first step towards a solution but the number of victims continues to grow. A great deal therefore remains to be done. We have submitted proposals on prevention, reception of victims and legislation. A society faced with such a phenomenon has a moral duty towards the victims and must give a high priority to the fight against trafficking in people and to victim support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are profoundly affected by the tragedy of trafficking in women which is a modern form of slavery. Our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims. We must fight to eliminate all the links in the chain, namely recruitment, transport, managers, middlemen and clients. By holding this debate today in the European Parliament, we are helping the victims to regain their dignity and integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and children are being traded like goods and doomed to prostitution. Trafficking in women is an important type of trade for organised crime which regards human beings as goods to be bought and sold. Misfortune, misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries. They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married. They have no idea of the miserable conditions in which they will be exploited, beaten, tortured and threatened. Over half of the victims are under the age of 25 and around 10% are between 15 and 18. Even if these very young girls seem willing, because they are being threatened or are in love, we cannot, at any price, allow prostitution to continue freely when you see how these women are terrorised and traded.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in our opinion, we cannot use the term ‘forced prostitution’ in this report. Trafficking in women involves terrible sexual exploitation. We must help these victims to speak out and denounce their living conditions. We must welcome and help them. The pimps are very violent and victims must pay off large debts to cover the cost of their journeys and the various identity documents which they must acquire. When they resist the pressure of traffickers and pimps, they are threatened either personally or through their families. The traffickers belong to a Mafia-like criminal organisation and control several links in the network that has power over the victim. There is no way out for victims and the very nature of the environment in which they work often reduces them to despair and drug addiction. Some even go as far as committing suicide.</p>
<p class="contents">Fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this. It is therefore vital to establish a system of information and preventive education for both young people in the countries concerned and also clients who are often what we would call ‘family men’.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that trafficking has economic roots. Inequalities and relationships of dependency between privileged and disadvantaged countries mean that it is still always the weakest in society, particularly the women, who pay the price. We demand a coherent European policy which is why this report is so important. Trafficking in women is a crime. Trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation are unworthy of humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are touching upon an important topic here, namely that of people’s dignity. As has been said, it is not just about trafficking in women, although that is the subject of the communication, but it extends to trafficking in people generally. Men, girls and boys, are also involved. </p>
<p class="contents">It is a growing problem in the EU, too. Trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative. Not only do women from Asian countries fall victim, but also more and more women from Central and Eastern European countries, including women from candidate countries. They are lured under false pretences – through job advertisements, for example – into becoming hairdressers or into working in bars or as dancers, or else they are enticed via the lonely hearts columns. Women are often easy prey, given the poor conditions they live under. </p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in women is increasingly linked with international criminal organisations. A great deal has been done, but still more needs to be done, especially when it comes to aligning different countries’ legislation for the purposes of tracing and prosecution and when it comes to providing information to the police and courts. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I welcome the European Commission’s initiative, as well as the specific proposals in the report, for example, with regard to the further harmonisation of legislation which may facilitate the tracing of victims and prosecution of offenders and make these activities more efficient; with regard to cooperation and coordination, especially during investigations, at police stations and in the courts; and also specifically with regard to the reception and protection of victims. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope it will be possible to adopt the amendment on non-governmental organisations, tabled by our group and amended in consultation with the Greens. Whenever new needs arise, emergency help is often provided by people or groups of people who feel compelled to do something about these on ideological grounds or out of religious conviction. These groups do not always get the recognition they deserve. The amendment states that NGOs can also include ideologically-based organisations. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to state that this is an important communication from the Commission. It is a sound communication and a sound report on which I would like to congratulate Mrs Sörensen. I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The victims have described savage beatings, rapes, abductions, death threats and, on occasions, murders. The real scandal is that we not only tolerate it in Europe, but we contribute to its expansion. Every time members of the public purchase the sexual services of a woman trapped in a trafficking ring, they are adding to the abhorrent wealth of these criminal organisations, which employ increasingly cruel methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the institutions’ search for solutions is progressing very slowly, and the problem is growing. In any event, we should recognise that the European Commission’s proposals are, on the whole, reasonable and hopefully useful. Nevertheless, and given the cross-border nature of this crime, we need to harmonise its classification in all the Member States, including cross-border aspects and universal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">The receiving countries should grant the victims a temporary residence permit for the duration of legal proceedings, regardless of whether or not they wish to testify. Furthermore, the extremely harsh conditions in which the victims live more than justify the Member States granting them permanent residence permits for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, persecution on the basis of gender and, specifically, the trafficking in women, should be considered appropriate grounds for the granting of refugee status. If we really want to help the victims, we must guarantee their safety as well as that of their families and compensate them through the seizure of the networks’ assets. These victims should also have free access to shelter, medical and psychological assistance, social services, help in finding work, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these considerations have been approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, but they will not be enough. Combating the trafficking in women and immigration policy must become a priority within the political agenda of the European Union and the Member States. Immigration policies which revolve around the consequences and which are not aimed at tackling the causes will do nothing more than exacerbate this terrible pattern of exploitation which is tantamount to slavery. Poverty, social inequality and armed conflict explain migratory flows. Until we find overall solutions to the question of development, the number of people searching for a better life will be unstoppable and migratory pressure uncontainable.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us analyse, assess and implement genuine development and integration policies. At the end of the day, the fight against the trafficking in human beings, as well as being essential to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, is an unavoidable ethical duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only is she proficient, she is also extremely committed to the subject matter. The fact that she managed to put this important topic on the European agenda is a huge achievement. </p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in women has been overlooked for too long, and politicians underestimate its importance. A good illustration of this is that it is now three years since the Justice Ministers declared that it was important to appoint national rapporteurs to monitor trafficking in women. This actually happened in the Netherlands, not least thanks to the efforts of Secretary of State Verstand. Unfortunately, many Member States still do not have national rapporteurs and they really should remedy this as soon as possible. At the same time, legislation as well as cooperation are inadequate. </p>
<p class="contents">This report offers many ideas and specific proposals and therefore has the backing of the Liberal Group. There are, however, two points which may seem commendable, but to which we are unfortunately unable to subscribe. The first concerns automatic refugee status for victims of trafficking in women. In our opinion, this is a bridge too far, because this would require the entire Geneva Convention to be overturned. We do find it important, however, that it should be possible to grant residence permits on humanitarian grounds. We will therefore continue to support this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof. What is required here is tantamount to surrendering an important and fundamental part of legal protection, namely the fact that one is considered innocent until proven guilty. This principle is important in a constitutional state. The concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace. To incorporate this principle into criminal law would be a huge step. Liberals attach great importance to legal protection and we are not prepared to take that step now. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency. This is why it would be wrong to weigh down this discussion with moral judgements on prostitution, as certain people here are attempting to do. If we do this, it will make the discussion infinitely more complex and will get in the way of effective measures against the trafficking in women. This should not happen. </p>
<p class="contents">The problem is urgent and effective measures are required. Not just words, but deeds are what are needed now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is very fortunate that Mrs Sörensen should have been given the responsibility of preparing this report on trafficking in women. There are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for Mrs Sörensen has been concerned for over 20 years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution. We should therefore place our full trust in her proposals. I myself totally support her report. However, I should like to comment briefly on the discussions held on this subject in committee and also in the Member States, given that the United Nations Conference on the situation of women throughout the world, to be held in New York in June, is now approaching.</p>
<p class="contents">In these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women, prostitution and pimping. They have therefore encouraged a certain amount of generalisation and are, as a result, opposed to any form of debate on these issues, hiding behind moral considerations such as the inalienability of the human body and its treatment as a saleable commodity. To this end, they have attacked the latest report by the International Labour Office on trafficking in women and prostitution, and the work of Mrs Lin Lean Lim highlighting the need for a statute to protect prostitutes. They have also decried Europe as a pimp on the grounds that certain countries are trying to establish non-abolitionist legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We surely cannot leave an issue such as this in the hands of associations of which some, and only some, having fought against abortion, are now refusing the distribution of condoms to prostitutes, which they see as encouraging prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate. The only solution for prostitutes is to be integrated within a common law system, to look after themselves, to live decently, to defend themselves against the violence to which they are subjected by pimps, clients and institutions. The only solution is to recognise prostitutes as such and, as a first step, to give them a voice. Recognition of their professional activity, full social rights and police protection from any form of violence are what they are demanding. We must listen to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether legislation is abolitionist as in France, prohibitionist as in Sweden or even sometimes regulatory, if it fails to recognise a whole population this can only reinforce discrimination against forced immigrants and also prostitutes, irrespective of whether they are immigrants or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The ineffectiveness of the law reinforces the enslavement of male and female prostitutes by pimps, for some, and the impossibility for others of living with dignity or of getting out of prostitution. This leads to a breakdown in any fragile solidarity and further damage to their self-image. Mrs Roure is right in her analysis of this problem but we accept that different solutions must be examined and that various proposals must be made and considered. The Commission absolutely must examine all forms of common legislation on prostitution which would give real status to prostitutes in order to protect these women and men from pimping, violence and marginalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are almost one hundred per cent in agreement in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. We would emphasise not only the cooperation from the police which has fed into this report, but also the importance of contributions at all levels of society. </p>
<p class="contents">There are nonetheless two things we do not entirely agree with. The first concerns the role of the sex industry in this issue. We are, all of us, right across the political spectrum, completely agreed that it is poverty that is the major cause of prostitution and trafficking in women. I nonetheless believe that the sex industry, which is now moreover beginning to register some of its activities on the stock exchange, must be called into question and, in future, also held to account. </p>
<p class="contents">The other disputed issue is – as always where this subject is concerned – the view to be taken of prostitution. Almost throughout the report, the term <span class="italic">enforced</span> prostitution is used. However, the use of this term implies that there is an opposite, that is to say <span class="italic">voluntary</span> prostitution. That is very strange, especially when we are talking about slavery and trafficking in women. </p>
<p class="contents">The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has tabled a few amendments, some of them on this subject and in connection with which we naturally hope that we shall receive support. I would again thank Mrs Sörensen and all our colleagues. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the last time we debate this issue, even though it is so far only the second time we have done so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also falls within the wider global context of international crime and trafficking in human beings. Raising such an issue today might seem anachronistic but slavery will indeed be a part of the 21st century. It is a potent force which takes advantage of the misery of the displaced who travel the world against their will, who are sold, bought and then brought to Europe. Nothing is preventing these global pimps from pressurising families to sell their children and luring girls to Europe to make them work and become prostitutes.</p>
<p class="contents">During a conference organised jointly by the United States of America and the Philippines in March, the very lucrative aspect of this new market was also raised. Trafficking in human beings is, after drugs and weapons, the third largest source of income for organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet trafficking in human beings is, above all, a violation of human dignity and human rights. Our societies are demanding the right to happiness, pleasure and freedom, and the removal of taboos. It seems not to matter if people, women and children in particular, are paying the price by being dragged down into the underworld. Prostitution is a form of slavery which we like to make out to be exotic and romantic in order to hide its tragedy and sordidness. Yet it is actually a denial of freedom. These crimes are committed solely for the sake of pleasure and are treated with widespread indifference by a society which accepts prostitution as the oldest profession in the world. This is also true of pornography which is found in the daily papers, on television and on the Internet, where everything can be bought, even girls. Prostitution, trafficking in human beings, sex tourism and paedophilia are all issues highlighted by the media which are gradually becoming less taboo. So much the better, for the resignation shown towards what society has deemed to be irreversible is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now help these people whose bodies are being exploited for commercial purposes, both in our countries and in their countries of origin, by increasing aid for development, education and cooperation between countries. The European Union must wake up to this situation and, rather than giving lessons to the women of the world, five years after the Beijing Conference, it would do better to clean up its own backyard. Trafficking in human beings is incredibly widespread in our countries because the demand exists and because the European Union is adept at showing itself to be a greedy customer, disdainful of the distress caused to these adults and children who have been denied any choice.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will refer to the slogan of the seminar organised in Paris on 15 May under the patronage of the European Parliament which says that the humiliation of human beings through prostitution represents an intolerable attack on human rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are sure that Parliament will adopt this extremely well-balanced report by a very large majority, for no one could tolerate the current violence perpetrated against women who are abducted or forced by deception and threats to enter the European Union, where they are compelled to live a life of forced prostitution or do some other sort of job under coercion. </p>
<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the horrific stories of prostitutes, often minors, who are abducted from their native countries, forced to enter the Union – we are told – illegally, raped and threatened with retaliation against their relatives or even killed if they have the courage to denounce their pimps. The report recommends possible solutions which have already been successfully implemented, such as issuing victims with residence permits and providing protection and free healthcare. These measures, which have already been successfully implemented in some States, must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw your attention to a matter of paramount importance: is it not the direct and indirect prohibition of prostitution and the restrictive laws on immigration which are responsible for trafficking in women and forced prostitution? Is it not the case that the victims of prostitution-related crimes are compelled to enter that profession because of their illegal immigrant status and their vulnerability, caught between the violence of their pimps and the forces of the law? Is it not the very fact of prohibition which renders the phenomenon it is intended to control uncontrollable, tragic and inhuman? And why should those people who, of their own free will, want to be prostitutes have to suffer from what is essentially a ban<span class="bold"> </span>on related activities and the subterfuge which, in practice, criminalise the practice of voluntary prostitution, even though prostitution is formally legal in many Member States?<span class="bold"> </span>Moreover, would the legalisation of voluntary prostitution not also allow foreign prostitutes to improve their situation in that they would no longer be obliged to work illegally in violent conditions as they are now?</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we have tabled two amendments: the first amendment calls for the preparation of a cost/benefit analysis of the various laws and policies currently in place and those which may be adopted in the future; the second amendment proposes measures to protect adults from criminal exploitation and violence, adults who, in all freedom from direct or indirect coercion, choose to work as prostitutes, accepting to run their business in accordance with legal procedures.<span class="bold"> </span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some 500 000 victims of the traffic in human beings arrive each year in Western Europe. It is imperative to tackle trafficking in women because, having shown its determination to fight money laundering, drug trafficking and organised crime, the European Union has forgotten that trafficking in human beings is one of the major aspects of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate Mrs Sörensen on her report which has come on the eve of the enlargement of the Union to the CCEEs, which are often singled out as the countries of origin or transit in prostitution and modern-day slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the method, I must say that the fight against trafficking in human beings does not necessarily need full communitarisation but rather close cooperation between Member States under the aegis of Europol and Interpol. These inter-state structures have proven their effectiveness on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to ensure that trafficking in human beings is regarded as a criminal offence to be severely punished in all Member States. In doing so, examples must also be made of those responsible for instigating such networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current state of legislation, we are faced with a wide diversity of penal traditions in our Member States. Establishing specific offences at Community level would therefore lead to an impasse. Instead, we must take inspiration from the method in the Schmid report on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. The Council of Ministers could, on a proposal from the Commission, draw up a list of criminal behaviour to be combated, which the Member States would be responsible for converting into criminal offences in accordance with their legal traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am sure that this would render the action we are taking to combat this scourge more effective and that we would avoid the pitfalls of a harmonisation which would delay the measures which must now be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
