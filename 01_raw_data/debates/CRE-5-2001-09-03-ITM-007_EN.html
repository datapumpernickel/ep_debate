<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menrad (PPE-DE)</span></span>  ,<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in September 1994 the Council adopted the Directive on the establishment of a European works council. The transposition of this Directive is the subject of a Commission report. The report submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopts a position on this Commission report. In terms of sheer numbers, we can already talk about the European works council as a success story. When the Directive was adopted by Parliament and the Council in 1994, there were approximately 30 voluntary agreements governing information and consultation in respect of the work forces of companies and groups of companies throughout Europe. In the meantime, this number has risen to above 650. The Commission report demonstrates that the Directive on the European works council was the main driving force behind this development.</p>
<p class="contents">In establishing European works councils, the solutions, more or less made to measure and reached at company level between the management and the special employee negotiating body, are granted priority. As with the European limited liability company, here too the formula of flexibility, negotiations and minimum standards – applicable if negotiations have not reached a successful conclusion – applies. These are referred to as subsidiary requirements in the EWC Directive. The shocking events at Renault Vilvoorde in Brussels demonstrated for the first time that the aim of the European works councils had not always been achieved, whereby the relocation of production should not be effected in the form of a commando raid but only after the employees concerned have been informed and consulted in good time. However, every light has its shadow. The directive has its weak points, and the Committee for Social Affairs is pressing for a revision. We did not say that this should have been undertaken as early as 1999 or 2000. In the discussion of the social agenda, the Commission specified the year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Our motion for a resolution is intended to form the basis for discussion with a view to the amendment of the EWC Directive. In a range of discussions, hearings and symposia, I have heard the complaint that, in some serious cases – especially in the case of emergency consultation – information and consultation have not been taking place in good time. Therefore, the proposed improvements, which aim to ensure that information and consultation take place in good time, remain the main focus of the report, the object being that advice from the European works council is listened to, and can also be taken into account, prior to decisions by the management. The report is in favour of an enhanced consultation procedure with a view to reaching agreement. Today I would like to add the words: with a view to reaching agreement ‘on the further procedure’. I am not saying that it shall be compulsory to reach agreement, though, as previously in the Committee meetings, I reject the right of veto of the European works council in accordance with Amendment No 5, which was submitted today.</p>
<p class="contents">My report contains the more elegant solution, proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, to hold, if necessary, a second round of meetings, as is also provided for by the Directive on the European limited liability company. A broader right to information and consultation on the part of the European works council shall not affect an important stipulation of the directive, formulated in recital K of the present report at the request of Mr Bushill-Matthews. The management’s right to communicate directly with the workforce remains as unaffected as its right to manage the company. Partnership and subsidiarity must also, according to the amendment, determine the contents of the EWC Directive. There are principles of Christian social doctrine which, of course, has supporters in different parties. Based on the initiative of the European Parliament, the legislative text of 1994 established an EWC Directive calling for the spirit of cooperation. Partnership is not a soporific measure. Partnership is intended to provide a clear representation of interests, and also a balancing of the interests of employee and employer by means of information and consultation, which is also advantageous from an economic point of view. The failure to provide information results in uncertainty, distrust and finally anxiety, which leads to blockades. Providing information in good time is a sign of transparency, which breeds trust…</p>

The experience up until that point was positive, with clear benefits being brought about by this directive. However, recent events have shown some weaknesses in the works council directive, noticeably in relation to restructuring as we have seen several cases recently of major restructuring in multinationals in which workers have not been consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">We should note that, even before the adoption of this directive, the Court of Justice in various cases held that works councils were parties concerned for the purposes of merger control proceedings. That presupposes a duty to inform and consult on the part of the employer. We should like to see a strengthening of the directive in relation to consultation in the event of restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission in its report also refers to the vagueness of the requirement for an information and consultation meeting to be held with the workers as soon as possible in the event of exceptional circumstances which affect employees. That also needs to be tightened. Article 27 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights says that workers should be guaranteed information and consultation ‘in good time’, which is a rather more strict interpretation than ‘as soon as possible’. The Committee on Legal Affairs would like to see strengthening in relation to that point.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we find that part-time workers are dealt with differently in different Member States. We would like to see the Commission look into that aspect, and into the question of time off for activities in the works councils, which varies from Member State to Member State. This should also apply regarding the matter of training, which also varies considerably. We would like to see the Commission come forward with proposals to ensure that there is harmonised training across Member States in order to ensure that workers' representatives are able to put their case as effectively as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, however, like to stress three points that I consider to be vital. The first point was mentioned in paragraph 12 with the reference to the 1998 directive on redundancies for operational reasons, which provides employee representatives with the possibility of notifying a competent authority on the basis of information submitted by the company’s management, if they believe that alternative solutions have not been explored in order to avoid redundancies, site closures or if there is doubt surrounding the legality of the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, with regard to current problems in European-based companies, including sometimes those problems which occur when there are mergers and acquisitions authorised by the Commission and by its Competition Directorate, the issue raised, and which was also raised by Mrs Diamantopolou, the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, in the wake of the Marks &amp; Spencer case, is how do employees, their representatives and their works councils go about notifying the European Commission and showing that their social right is sometimes brushed aside because the issues involved are purely financial and stock market-related. From this perspective, I support Amendment No 5 by Mrs Ainardi and Mrs Figueiredo, and personally I shall be voting in favour of this. The second point, which is related to this amendment, is that of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must put in place considerable sanctions which will act as a deterrent, and also specify – and this is the underlying meaning of one of Mr Menrad’s paragraphs, but I would have liked this to be clearer so that employees and citizens are aware – that, in the event of non-compliance with the procedures for information and consultation, decisions to make employees redundant or to close down sites can be overturned. I will conclude, as Mr Menrad did, by asking the Commission to realise the urgent nature of this request by Parliament, not to wait until 2002 and to formulate a proposal that reflects the determination of the overwhelming majority of the groups to see an increase in the rights of employees of companies that are based in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it should be noted that certain countries only implemented this directive last year and that at least one country has not yet implemented certain provisions at all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that companies and their employees still need some time to complete the learning process involved in establishing European works councils. Premature changes to the rules can only cause confusion, though it is clearly useful for the Commission and Council to take note of Parliament's views at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur knows, I believe in information and consultation. I support the principle of works councils, I share his wish for their success. However, as he also knows, I am not at all happy with certain elements of his report. I still believe it goes too far in reference to sanctions in reducing thresholds in terms of sizes of companies and – frankly – in pushing the trade union agenda as an end in itself rather than in promoting the interests of employees. For these reasons, I have tabled four amendments, for which I have already secured some cross-party support and I also propose to vote against Recitals 5 and 7, as he knows.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I thank the rapporteur for accommodating some amendments in committee and I confirm that I am still willing to vote in favour of his whole report, despite my serious concerns, if the PPE-DE Group supports two of my amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 1 and 3, as we have already discussed. In that way we could show that our own mini-European works council of a German rapporteur, a Dutch group coordinator and myself from the United Kingdom have set a good example in achieving a positive result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Menrad for his thorough work in drawing up this report, including the hearings he organised together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to examine closely the incorporation of the directive into national legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This study shows, without a doubt, that the incorporation of the directive into national legal systems is, for the most part, having positive results and that European works councils have been set up in around 2000 European companies. In many companies, the directive has contributed to eliminating the barriers to information and consultation. What is more, the timely participation of the Company committees in some of the decision-making processes has certainly yielded positive results, first and foremost for the workers in areas such as health, safety and equal opportunities but also for the companies in that the number of disputes has fallen.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the Menrad report – which we support – also reveals a series of gaps in the directive itself, and I consider it absolutely essential that the Commission takes measures to amend the directive to deal with these gaps without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, in particular, like to focus on three elements which, in addition to those cited by other Members, I feel are the most sensitive points and those which require swift action to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the information timeframe: there is no clear stipulation in the directive regarding the timely provision of information and, in recent years – we have often discussed the matter in this House – we have adopted resolutions but have, I regret to say, had a great deal of negative incidents such as workers learning of their fate from the press or being presented with a final decision by companies. In this regard, we could cite cases such as <span class="italic">Ahlston</span>, <span class="italic">Adb</span>, <span class="italic">Marks and Spencer</span> and many others. Well then, if this is the case, it is necessary, absolutely essential for the directive to be more precise, for it to lay down timeframes which ensure that information is provided and consultation carried out before any decision is taken, to provide a real opportunity for negotiation, otherwise it will serve no purpose at all!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am sure the Members will agree with me when I say that there are no rules in a legal system which, if disregarded, lose their effect. It is strange that it is only in the area of work and social rights that this is almost the norm! There have thus been many disputes and incidents of recourse to industrial tribunals in recent years, precisely because the failure of companies to respect the stipulations of the directive does not on any account place in question the validity of the effects of the decision taken and certainly does not do so automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary for appropriate, dissuasive penalties to be laid down and, similarly, in serious cases of breach of the directive, it is necessary to provide for the suspension of a decision in order to allow negotiations to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s report on the European works councils shows that there is a fair way to go before the law is implemented in practice and all the undertakings concerned have set up works councils. Is it therefore a correct response to require that still more businesses be covered by the directive and to demand tougher sanctions against those companies that do not implement the directive? The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party cannot support reducing the size of those companies covered by the directive to five hundred employees in one Member State and one hundred in each additional Member State. I am also sceptical about some of the requests for sanctions that have been put forward here in Parliament. They may run counter to national systems which, in actual fact, operate well. Nor can it be reasonable for companies to be penalised differently for the same offence, as will happen if their managements’ actions are rendered invalid or if, by failing to provide enough information and by not consulting sufficiently, they are excluded from public subsidies or public procurement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revision of the Directive on European Works Councils is obviously a crucial way of clawing back this credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do the employees who are victims of these restructurings have to say about the possibility of using this directive? To take some examples, they say that the current legislation on the right to information and consultation is flouted on a regular basis by companies, due to the lack of precise definitions for these terms, that they have no administrative and judicial support which is needed in order to check compliance with the directive, that the directive only applies in very restricted circumstances and is not at all applicable in many transnational companies with numbers of employees lower than the current threshold, that it is inconceivable that authorisations for mergers are granted when the only criterion to be fulfilled is that of observing the competition law and that the social, regional or environmental impact of mergers is not taken into account, that they are powerless when mergers are taking place, during which previous consultation procedures are no longer used, since new procedures have yet to be set up, and, finally, that they are disgusted to see that the same companies which undertake these severe restructurings have occasionally received assistance from the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Mr Menrad’s report, which is the result of work that was carried out in an open, cooperative spirit, involving the social actors concerned and members of the Commission, which organised a broad public hearing on this issue, recommends bridging these gaps with a precise definition of information and consultation, by reducing, as proposed, the thresholds of employees required to establish a works council, by requesting that specific premises for consultation are maintained during mergers, by requesting that decisions made and which flout procedures can be overturned, and by introducing sanctions, including financial, for companies at fault and finally, by taking into account the opinion of employees and providing evidence that the procedures of the directive have been observed, prior to giving authorisations to mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, these proposals have the support of our group. Obviously, we still need to ensure – and this requires a combined effort – that the directive is revised quickly and effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when growth is giving us cause for concern, we should give thought to the content of this growth and the necessity to develop it, by encouraging job stability and skills. There is an urgent need for genuine consultation with employees, an urgent need to dispense with the attitude of treating men and women as goods which are no longer useful, because shareholders consider that they are not profitable enough, even in spite of the true economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Menrad’s report is the fruit of considerable labour, and I would also like to acknowledge his efforts. The report is also the result of the willingness of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to listen to representatives of the employees of large European companies. Using these meetings as a basis, the Menrad report was able to make a reliable assessment of the situation by showing the need for considerable amendments to the content of the directive. I support many of the proposals made in the report. I would like to reiterate some of them which in my view represent major steps forward for employees.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the call, set out in the second paragraph, for information and consultation to take place at regular intervals before the decision by the company or group, so as to allow the workers genuinely to influence the management’s decision-making process. Furthermore, in particularly serious cases, this information could even extend to giving the employees’ representatives the possibility of gaining a negotiating period before a decision takes effect, as described in item 14. I shall again quote the second item, which contains a clause that the decisions of the management will only be regarded as legitimate if an orderly information and consultation process as defined in the Directive has taken place beforehand, or item 13, which proposes the introduction of sanctions for non-compliance. Lastly, there is also the call for companies to repay funds and financial aid provided if they do not observe the law in this area, and to exclude them from public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are a step in the right direction, but I believe that to ensure action for employment is effective and to improve economic performance in Europe, we could have gone further with regard to the right of employees to participate in the future of companies. This is the goal of the amendment that my group tabled, which calls for the possibility of employees’ representatives to have the right to a suspensive veto. This would involve giving a guarantee to employees’ representatives that their alternative proposals would at least be examined and taken into account. Many decisions which have spelled disaster for companies and for employment could have been avoided if employees had been able to influence these decisions. This right, which is an expression of social justice and democracy within a company, also guarantees efficiency for the economy and society.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the Menrad report represents a considerable step forward and this is why it has the support of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Overall, the progress made in implementing the Directive on the establishment of a European works council has been positive, since there are now approximately 650 European works councils, most of which were set up on the basis of pre-Directive agreements, in other words, on a voluntary and agreed basis.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />There are still 1 200 companies, however, which have not established European works councils.</p>
<p class="contents">As the effects of globalisation demand new measures, the cornerstone of which are trans-national representation and information, it is advisable to consider the factors which stand in the way of European social dialogue in companies, and the report presented by the Commission which evaluates both legal transposition and practical application of the Directive in Member States now gives us that opportunity. The debates which took place in committee were useful and I would also like to congratulate Mr Menrad for his preference for dialogue and the work he did to achieve conciliation. Nonetheless, the broad consensus which existed within this committee on the need to develop information and consultation, on both a European and national level, must not hide some differences in approach which my colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that it is important to reiterate in this Chamber that genuine social dialogue in a company requires tools that are flexible and which can evolve, and not a standard, restrictive and detailed framework, such as that which some of our fellow Members would like to reintroduce when the 1994 Directive is revised. That is why I would like to stress how important we consider that the imminent reform of this directive does not take the shape of a far-reaching reform of its spirit and particularly, that we retain the difference in terms of function between the Directive itself, which is the tool of social dialogue in a company, and its Annex which punishes the failure of social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, lowering the thresholds for applying the Directive must not be an aim in itself; rather, this should be perceived as a straightforward option to extend this mechanism. This is why I agree with Amendment No 3, tabled by our fellow Member, and the French delegation will support this, but we are rather more puzzled by Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to provide an explanation for the text included in paragraph 2(i), namely that information and consultation of employees must be carried out, with due regard for the principles of confidentiality of the information. This is a very important provision which particularly refers to cases where timely information and consultation of workers, which is perfectly natural, could conflict with the law by virtue of the legislation on the securities market. The provision is therefore fundamental in order to encourage competitiveness of companies in the global economy and the safeguarding of the European social model. I hope that the Commission will take this into account when preparing its proposal for revising the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On many occasions, these events take place with unnecessary complications that lead to other, equally disastrous consequences which, in turn, affect workers and the rights from which they benefit in the Member States, which are constantly being weakened by these so-called relocations and greater mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the rapporteur’s comments about Article 127 of the Treaty, which lays down clear rules, which apply to both competition and social legislation, specifically on informing and consulting workers. We must clearly enshrine the right of workers and citizens to freely choose their destiny and also where and how they wish to work. The truth is that the damaging examples of this much sought after mobility of companies and employers are still shocking public opinion in my country even today. I shall take this opportunity to condemn what the representatives of one particular company – on this occasion it happens to be British, with headquarters in London and offices in the Republic of Ireland and in Portugal – are doing with vast contingents of Portuguese and Polish workers. These workers are placed, given the exceptional situation in Northern Ireland, in high-risk situations, with no contract, no protection, and no security, often being left to their unpleasant fate. This may seem to be their bad luck, but this really does seem to be the fate of Portuguese workers who are simply looking for better salaries and better working conditions. Yet, they are stuck in the position of not even being able to return home. Mobility is a threat not only to those who cling to it because they are socially disadvantaged, but also organised workers. These provide a warm welcome for the aforementioned disadvantaged workers and choose to stand up for them, helping them to integrate. And it is they who are their only resource, the workers representatives and their solidarity, as well as the unions, in these very distressing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, like to see this law made effective and extended, since it is still a long way from achieving the social objective that the Community itself and the Treaties advocate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to bear in mind, given what we heard already this evening, that Lisbon was not about competition, but social cohesion as well. Companies are increasingly being expected to behave in an ethical and socially responsible manner. Sound employment practices and good working relationships with employees are key indicators for such ethical assessment and we need to see the recommendations in the report in that light.</p>
<p class="contents">The report points out a number of ways in which a revised directive could make works councils more effective and prevent some of the problems and breakdowns we have heard about: regular meetings, not the token annual meeting that is all 85% of them manage; increasing the representation of women, who are virtually invisible in many of these bodies, just as they are in too many boardrooms; training to improve the quality of representation and communication; and the facilities and safeguards to ensure that works council members represent all sectors effectively. The sanctions for non-compliance are also critical. We either want responsible social partners, or we do not. My group does, so we welcome this report and look forward to seeing Commission proposals based on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware of the countless difficulties and serious problems of unemployment that workers and their works councils are facing, particularly those in multinational companies, in the processes of restructuring and relocation that have intensified over the last few years without the rights of workers being respected in the majority of cases. These workers have been treated on many occasions as mere economic commodities. The current directive must, therefore, be fundamentally changed, particularly in terms of the procedures for informing and consulting workers and of the possibility of intervention by the European works councils, specifically through additional sanctions and a suspensive veto in cases in which restructuring, relocations and mergers do not take account of the reasonable rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the Commission presents proposals for amendments to this directive, as we have already requested on numerous occasions, and that it at least includes the improvements contained in the Menrad report and approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in addition to the proposal upon which our group insists. It is essential that there should be a robust and timely consultation process for all workers and the possibility of the right to a suspensive veto on a decision that may have harmful consequences for workers, in such a way as to allow negotiations to take place and for these harmful consequences to be avoided. It is equally important, as the Menrad report states, that companies that do not satisfy workers’ rights regarding their information and consultation and all other aspects of the directive, with the new amendments that we ourselves are proposing, will not only not receive any financial aid from Structural Funds and be obliged to return any Community or national aid that has been granted them, but they will also be excluded from public contracts and subsidies. I hope, therefore, that the Commission accepts these positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And plurality means the obligation to regulate the role of workers throughout the organisation. I believe that Mr Menrad’s report responds magnificently to this issue and we must congratulate him on the quality of his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the Directive is to improve the right of workers to be informed and consulted by the multinational companies or groups which operate in Europe. It is estimated that currently more than 1 100 multinationals, which employ approximately 15 million people, would be affected by this Directive and by its modification. I agree with the rapporteur when he asks for and expects the Commission to amend Directive 94/45/EC, making information and consultation rights into a means for facilitating social dialogue as a key element of social and labour relations in the companies affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with him when he asks for the role of these participation, information and consultation bodies not only to be relevant at times of industrial transformation and crisis, but that they should be of a permanent nature in a global economy in which we see symptoms and characteristics of globalisation, and, furthermore, that the exercise of these rights be enshrined at the appropriate procedural moment.</p>
<p class="contents">And all of this is so that workers are guaranteed that their voice will be heard, not only at times of restructuring, but whenever decisions are taken which are essential to the permanence and future of the company and of their workplaces or delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the content of the amendments I have presented and which the rapporteur has been kind enough to incorporate.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day we hear news of essential social importance which shocks us: all the delegations of a company are being closed in one or various countries; the company is studying a massive reduction in jobs; a merger is announced and the workers are wondering what will happen and how many will be fired or sent home, and these decisions are often taken for stock exchange reasons – to improve share prices – rather than for fundamental reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication after the decision serves little purpose in these cases. The company is an organisation, sometimes a community, with somewhat conflicting interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the content of these rights must also refer to training, to ongoing learning, to health and to safety, to equality of opportunity, to the environment, to the incorporation of young people into the workplace. All of this will make the company into a better-reconciled community, with less conflict. This will increase productivity and increase employment, and will improve living conditions, thereby leading to a better Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They join forces in organisations, and the most extreme also throw stones. In the meantime, the EU is blamed for making the negative aspects of globalisation worse. I believe that the discussion we are having today and the discussion we had concerning the Menrad report in our committee demonstrate the very opposite. They show that the EU can, in a very practical way, contribute to mitigating the negative aspects of the free market, in this case restructurings. The EU cannot abolish these, and nor should it, for they are a part of a modern market economy and they can have positive effects. However, we can try to mitigate the negative effects by properly involving employees in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing today and what we shall hopefully do in the future by means of a new directive is, in a very practical way, to make the market a little more democratic. The directive has already had an effect. The Commission’s report shows this. Works councils have been set up as a result of the directive. As other speakers too have said, there are, however, many things which can be improved, and I hope that the Commission will allow itself to be inspired by Parliament’s report today. Some of the improvements must take the form of cultural changes within companies. Undertakings must realise that consultation and the provision of information are not a laborious and onerous duty but a constructive part of modern management and that creating partnerships also creates responsible employees. At the same time, I hope that the Commission will lose no time at all in proceeding further with its deliberations concerning a new directive, and I should like to see an expansion of the topics on which employees are consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in general, we must look at the position of our fellow workers. We must understand that they are ordinary people from ordinary backgrounds who come together in the works councils. They must be given time off work, and there is a need for premises, training and translation facilities so that they can carry out their tasks as employee representatives. I also believe that employees must be able more readily to involve trade union experts. We must appreciate that there is a need to improve their conditions. A future directive might properly implement the constructive changes proposed by Parliament. These are not fanatical and far-reaching changes, but very constructive ones, and I hope that the Commission will take them on board when it proposes a new directive. Properly designed, the latter can be a further step in the direction of a European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have spoken several times in this House about the recent loss of 3000 jobs in Wales when the steel company Corus announced massive redundancies. When the Employment and Social Affairs Committee held the hearing in April this year and workers' representative from Corus European works council told us that in many ways it was a model works council. It met twice a year, it provided excellent training and it enabled experts to attend meetings. Yet it failed to tell the workers that they were about to get rid of 6000 jobs even when there was massive public speculation about these job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">This report states that the main goal of the directive is to remove obstacles to information, consultation and communication with the workforce to enable dialogue to take place. This is vitally important. It must be more than paying lip service to consultation. There must be a definition of consultation to ensure it is meaningful and comprehensive and carried out in good time, as others have said. In other words this must happen before decisions are made and not after and there must be sanctions against those who do not comply.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Menrad that we need a revision of the directive to prevent repeats of the Corus experience and to look at other issues he identifies such as the involvement of women. I hope that this debate will help achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even so, however, I shall not give my approval of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in order to counteract a limited increase in the rights of European works councils, the report calls upon us to approve competition rules and the confidentiality of information. The report also stresses that the role awaiting the councils is that of reducing the risk of conflict which may, the report claims, prove to be a factor in a company’s success, or rather, in an employer’s success.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, it is very clear that the final decision on all issues that affect workers’ lives is made by employers. Works councils have been rendered powerless, such as when Moulinex, Aventis, Danone and many other companies made unacceptable redundancies, or they are tricked into approving the employer’s decisions, or even into nominating the victims of redundancies, as was the case at AOM-Air Liberté.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Therefore, the only right which would, in truth, be a right for workers would be the right to employment, or a ban on redundancies, in other words, at least in companies that are making profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European works council has become more and more important: in 1994 there were 40, and in 2001 there are 650. In this respect, the European works council has promoted a European awareness outstandingly well and has furthered the interest of employees in transnational measures and in acts of solidarity in exactly the same way. However, there are problems; this we learnt during the hearing in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It is totally unclear what is meant by appropriate information. How can employees cultivate alternative plans if they receive information far too late? For example, if a radical restructuring of the company is envisaged, an enhanced consultation procedure must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European works councils usually meet once a year. At least two meetings a year, if not three, should take place. The European works councils must be able to get to know each other better. They must also understand the different mentalities. The former is the condition for promoting solidarity and ensuring sustained action, and as always women are seriously under-represented. Women do not even make up 10% of European works councils. A great deal of motivational work is needed within the companies in this regard, and this must be expressed practically in votes later on.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken with many works councils – also within my constituency. It is particularly important for them that we offer more training opportunities to compensate for language difficulties. I expressly agree with Mr Menrad, who is in favour of language courses for EWC members. Investment in training of employees is also essential – and I am thinking here of accounting regulations, employment law, social law – and we must work towards being able to say: What shall be on the agenda? The protection of health, the necessity of dealing with safety at work or the issue which Mr Menrad is always pursuing: employee participation. The rapporteur succeeded in including 75 proposals from the Committee on Employment and other proposals from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Indeed, he knew how to build bridges with us in the Committee, and 38 out of 38 were in favour. May tomorrow’s vote be just as successful! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Social dialogue within the European Union is a crucial factor for European integration itself. Hence the need to re-examine this directive on European works councils in companies that operate throughout the Community. Since 1994, 650 European works councils have been created, in contrast to the 40 or so that existed in the past. There is no doubt that this has been a success.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, great changes have taken place in the European labour market that require new responses and a stringent definition of the concepts of informing and consulting workers in companies operating throughout the Community, ensuring that this takes place in good time and under the appropriate conditions for a subsequent decision to be made. The range of themes covered by this process of information and consultation must be further extended, and the range must also be improved in matters of particular sensitivity for workers as a whole. Regular meetings for such a body are also necessary, for in around 85% of cases they meet just once a year, which is clearly insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The size that a company must be in order to be covered by this directive also warrants our attention, with a more reasonable threshold being required, a point on which we agree with Mr Menrad. The provisions relating to the protection and rights of workers’ representatives, who are freely elected by the workers, should be strengthened and there should be a balanced representation between men and women. Currently, 90% of the members of the specialist negotiating groups and of the European works councils are men.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to emphasise that the procedure for informing and consulting workers can lead to a deepening of the relationship between employers and workers in all Member States, thereby contributing to the development of a form of European consciousness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report has a relatively positive outlook, for today more than a third of the companies affected have implemented these works councils, yet it must be said that recent history surrounding certain redundancy programmes have made this process of informing and possible consultation more necessary than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">New draft directives have therefore been added to the 1994 text subject of this report. With regard to these drafts, I think that three different courses of action should be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the inclusion of measures so that, within a reasonable time, the majority of companies involved would have a European works council. From this point of view, the idea of lowering thresholds of employee numbers above which companies are affected does not seem very reasonable. We should in all cases honour the 1994 Directive. The second course of action should consist of proposing a global text that is a combination of different texts, rather than a stack of directives. The third measure should be to guarantee that autonomy and freedom in company management are preserved from the time when these companies can completely fulfil their duty to inform and consult.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Menrad, while I appreciate the work contained therein, has not been able to avoid certain pitfalls. It must be said that codetermination, a management technique favoured in Germany but in that country alone, has led him to accept socialist amendments from our fellow Member Mr Harlem Désir, amendments that our group had, upon my initiative, rejected in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I am thinking most notably of the thresholds above which companies are involved and the institution of part vetoes using sanctions in certain cases, which I truly regret.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Socialist Members, it must be said that they demonstrate a degree of stubbornness when they reject, for example with the postal or energy services, the Commission’s proposals with the view that what already exists should be applied, or vice-versa, as is the case here, to rely upon the widely perceived lengthy nature of proceedings to jump the lights when it suits them.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, competition, the opening up of markets and the creation of an internal market go hand in hand with informing and consulting employees. This is the reason why, with sadness but with certainty, I am going to abstain, if paragraphs 4 and 14 in particular are adopted as they stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will certainly form a very significant input into our review of the directive. In particular I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Menrad, for the effort he has put into this report over a long period. The report clearly reflects his profound knowledge of the subject. I am also conscious of the time that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has devoted to this issue and in particular the extremely useful public hearing which the Committee organised earlier this year, giving all actors the opportunity to express their views.</p>
<p class="contents">The report acknowledges the overall success in the operation of the directive, while identifying a number of weaknesses. The directive was the first piece of Community legislation to provide for a specifically transnational aspect of employer/employee relations and in doing so it broke completely new ground. From that beginning we now have a situation where there are European works council agreements in 650 companies or groups in Europe, covering about 60% of relevant employees. In each of those companies meetings are now taking place between management and employees from several Member States. That would have been almost unthinkable some years ago and it is a considerable achievement. Because of the inherent flexibility of the directive, this has been achieved notwithstanding the wide variation in employee participation and industrial relations systems in the Member States. As the report acknowledges, the directive has undoubtedly contributed to the development of a European consciousness among employee representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In acknowledging the directive's success, I should also like to acknowledge, as the report does, the role played by the trade unions, in particular the trade unions at European Union level. Their input into and coordination of numerous negotiations has made a major contribution to the success of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">To acknowledge the overall success of the directive is not, of course, to say that there have not been problems with this application. The Commission's report to Parliament and to the Council in April 2000 identified a number of legal and practical problems relating to the application of the directive. Parliament's report, prepared in response to the Commission's report, has elaborated on that analysis and identified a number of weaknesses in the operation of the directive and it proposes a series of changes to address those weaknesses. Parliament may be assured that we shall examine all its proposals carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">A key issue highlighted in the report, one which, as the report notes, has been the focus of much public interest of late, is the clarification of what we mean by information and consultation. We need to ensure that employees are informed and consulted at the right time, when they can still influence decisions. The report highlights some of the cases where, regrettably, employees have not been properly informed or consulted on major decisions affecting their livelihoods.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I share Parliament's concerns on this issue and since I am determined to do all in my power to meet those concerns, I was extremely encouraged by the decision of the Employment and Social Policy Council on 11 June to adopt unanimously a political agreement on a common position on the draft directive establishing a common framework for informing and consulting employees. The common position was formally adopted by the Council on 23 July. As Parliament may be aware, the Commission's proposal for this directive contained comprehensive provisions on information and consultation both as regards content and timing. I am pleased to see that Parliament's report has references to the Commission's proposal as a benchmark in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Parliament is now actively working on its second reading of the draft directive to allow for its adoption as soon as possible. There will be issues to be resolved between Parliament and Council, most notably on the issue of sanctions, a subject which has been raised by a number of speakers this afternoon. This is an issue where the Council's common position is furthest removed from the shared desire of Commission and Parliament to see effective sanctions: sanctions for failure to meet information and consultation obligations. Notwithstanding this, however, I believe that the political will now exists throughout the institutions to reach final agreement on this text quickly, thus putting in place a comprehensive framework for information and consultation throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as some of the issues raised in Parliament's reports relate to the information and consultation draft directive, so others – such as the role of trade unions, the issue of training for employee representatives and the length of time allowed to negotiate agreements – are touched on in the context of the draft directive supplementing the Statute for a European Company with regard to the involvement of employees. I am happy that Parliament has delivered its opinion on this text so promptly thus paving the way for its final adoption, I hope, at the October Employment and Social Policy Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's report acknowledges – and it will be clear from what I have just said – that the revision of the European works council directive is closely linked to these two legislative texts currently under consideration, that is to say firstly on information and consultation and secondly on employee involvement in the European Company. I have always believed that, because of that linkage, we should focus on finalising those two texts before addressing the revision of the European works council directive. That remains the Commission's strong view. But now, happily, we have the final adoption of those texts in sight and therefore it is my intention to be ready, as soon as the information and consultation directive is finalised, to address the revision of the European works council directive. The first stage of that process will, as indicated in the report, be a formal consultation of the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, may I give some brief replies to two specific questions. Firstly, a question by Mr Désir and Mrs Flautre on what the Commission are doing to address the social aspects of merger control. In brief, the answer is that the Commission has indicated its intention to examine the interaction between Community competition law on mergers and the social consequences of such mergers. The second question was put to me by Mr Désir. He asked about the Commission's plans as regards the timing of the revision of the European works council directive. I would reply that the Commission plans to address the revision of the European works council directive as soon as the information and consultation directive is adopted. The first step would be consultation of the social partners which, if conciliation on the information and consultation text is completed by the end of this year, could be launched early next year. The Commission has consistently taken the view that the timing of any revision of the European works council directive is inextricably linked to adoption of both the information and consultation directive and the final adoption of the European Company statute proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I once again thank Parliament very much indeed for its in-depth and knowledgeable reports which will provide crucial input into, not only the Commission's thinking, but also the thinking of the other actors in this important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
