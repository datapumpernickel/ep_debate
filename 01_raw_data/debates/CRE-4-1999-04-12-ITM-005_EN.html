<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Reding </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, these past few weeks have surely opened the eyes of those who did not understand before.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people being forced to flee Kosovo has clearly shown that migration policy in general – and asylum policy in particular – can no longer be tackled by countries on their own. Europeans will only be able to confront this serious problem by working together. However, it is not enough to make erudite and solemn declarations. These must be backed up by actions and specific political measures. And that is where the shoe pinches.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Maastricht Treaty is concerned, which has only been slightly modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam, political initiatives concerning migration and asylum policy are the responsibility of the various governments. Yet this intergovernmental policy does not work. More than twenty conventions or joint actions have been adopted but they have yet to be ratified. They are thus ineffective and of little use.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more serious is that the Council has still not reached any agreement on the text that would have greatly assisted us in the Kosovan crisis, in other words the ‘joint action on the temporary protection of persons displaced by conflicts". Politics will not be able to work effectively in Europe if we continue in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to migration and asylum policy, the main obstacle is Europe"s inability to take decisions at Community level with a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency reopened this debate by presenting a strategic document on the Union"s migration and asylum policy. It is in the light of this future policy – which we hope will win support at the extraordinary summit in Tampere – that Parliament is setting out its ideas on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, we do not want migration and asylum to be confused. The right to request political asylum is a fundamental right based on the Geneva Convention; it cannot be violated. Instead, we must harmonise reception conditions, streamline and speed up the procedures for processing applications, and increase solidarity between the Member States in terms of sharing refugees and the burden imposed by the massive numbers arriving. Nonetheless, irrespective of what we do, the right to request political asylum is a fundamental human right that cannot under any circumstances be violated. As regards migration for the purposes of seeking employment, we must support all efforts aimed at ensuring that legal immigrants are fully integrated into our society, to which they make a positive contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, illegal immigration is a completely different matter and must be combated effectively, particularly where criminal activities are involved. Illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings are new areas where serious organised crime is taking hold. European countries will only be able to prevent this most inhumane form of crime by pooling the resources they have to combat this phenomenon effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the migration and asylum policy is an issue for the future. If we do not tackle the problem together and propose effective solutions, we may well fail. The European Parliament does not want to see any such failure. It is therefore proposing an effective and workable action plan and it expects the governments to take action and put it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pirker </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, my report deals with the ‘Eurodac" system, which is designed to enable us to take the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and to compare them. The aims are threefold. Firstly, it should put us in a position to combat abuse effectively. We have established that there is an increasing number of multiple applications. What is taking place here is social abuse. We have also established that more and more criminals are applying for asylum in order to avoid the effects of legislation relating to aliens. What we have also discovered is that more and more illegal immigrants apply for asylum if they are apprehended after entering a country illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aim, after combating abuse, is to achieve an indirect sharing of the burden. It is in line with the Dublin Convention that people who are seeking refuge apply for asylum in the first country they have entered, and these countries are then required to examine the application for asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, very important, aim is that the true refugees, the real victims of persecution, must be granted maximum assistance as quickly as possible by ensuring fewer applications for asylum, faster processing of asylum procedures and effective use of the money available for the real asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">What led to the drafting of this report? The first document was the Eurodac Convention. As we know, the document was complete and there was agreement in the Council, but it was not signed and as a result of course it has not been ratified. Despite this we have racked our brains over how to extend the system to include taking the fingerprints of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the border or in the country, to compare them and to establish whether an application for asylum has already been made; this would also allow us to effectively implement the Dublin Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Protocol and the Convention have resulted in Parliament being asked to deliver an opinion in a relatively short period of time, even though they were not ratified and even though it was established in the Council that once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force the Commission and the Council are expecting to come up with a new regulation anyway. Parliament discussed this in committee and unanimously decided that it should nevertheless deliver an opinion, quite simply so that the Commission could also include Parliament"s ideas in its proposal under the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which I subsequently presented has been debated twice, and when it was put to the vote on 16 March, the situation changed as a result of a U‐turn by the PSE, the Greens and others. Suddenly a report was no longer needed and the draft was rejected. As rapporteur, I note the result in committee, even if I do not share its view, since my opinion is what was previously agreed unanimously by the entire committee, namely that Eurodac is necessary to combat current problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like – not as rapporteur but as a Member of this House and of the Group of the European People"s Party – to make a brief comment about this. What happened here at the end of the debate was a pathetic spectacle because the Socialist Group and others on the left simply caved in. They were not prepared to send out a signal that asylum abuse must be combated at all costs and that Parliament must exercise its authority to put forward proposals to the Commission that strengthen our position in the areas of asylum applications, the proper processing of applications and combating abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would appeal to the common sense of the House to support the Council proposal at tomorrow"s vote and to send out a strong signal in favour of an indirect sharing of the burden and combating abuse.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Zimmermann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both Commission proposals have been presented at a time when the importance of asylum policy for the European Union is becoming alarmingly clear. This concerns all stages that a refugee goes through in the EU: reception, stay and return to the country of origin. Unfortunately the Joint Action will no longer be adopted by the Council before the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force. This means that the Commission will have to submit a proposal for a regulation or a directive on the basis of the new Treaty as the joint action will no longer exist. Preparations had gone very well up to now.<br />I have however tabled substantial amendments to the action programme to promote the integration of refugees, relating to the target groups, the aims and the Community measures. These amendments have also been given the experts" seal of approval. It must be clear what we mean by integration. Is it only recognised refugees who have the right to benefit from measures designed to promote integration or is it also those who remain with us for only a short time? After all, integration measures can also help to smooth the path for voluntary repatriation to the country of origin. They are also the link between the action programme and the Joint Action.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority objective for integration is for refugees to be able to lead an independent life in the host country and be actively involved in society. We therefore prefer measures that allow an independent income and measures that bring citizens and refugees together on an equal footing. So I hope that this proposal, including my amendments, will receive your support in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a few basic points. The Kosovo crisis shows that a common asylum and immigration policy is urgently needed. Too many issues are unresolved and these prevent a rapid reaction to the desperate situation that refugees find themselves in. Firstly, we do not have a definition of refugees. We are not talking about the Kosovo refugees here. They are being persecuted because they belong to an ethnic group and are therefore in any case refugees as defined by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is temporary protection. If the Council had not failed to adopt the Commission proposal we would now be in a position to treat the Kosovo refugees differently. The Kosovo tragedy also shows that an asylum policy that has the sole aim of combating illegal immigration totally misses the point. We must once again concentrate much more on international solidarity and the needs of refugees. Above all, what we must do today is to prevent the Balkans, in which one war already started this century, from becoming a powder keg as a result of this tragedy. If we take in the refugees from this region it will not only give rise to high costs but will above all – and I consider this to be important – require a great deal of coordination and effort if it is really to be able to help the people in this region. In my opinion this is only possible if we do this jointly at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a measure can only succeed by agreement and in cooperation with the people concerned. The Kosovo crisis shows that the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees is in no way obsolete. It settles precisely those points on which the Member States are still unable to agree today. The haggling by the rich countries of Europe about the reception of – and we should really think about this – less than a tenth of the people that are wandering around in the Balkans is disgraceful!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Terrón i Cusí </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur and draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. – (ES)</span> Mr President, I am speaking as rapporteur and as draftsman of an opinion, but in relation to two different reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to talk about the Council"s draft Joint Action on the creation of an early warning system for the transmission of information on illegal immigration and facilitator networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, this basically consists of extending to the ‘enlargement countries" the decision taken in 1992 on the creation of the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration and concentrating its activities on rapidly detecting cases of supposedly massive immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament criticised the creation of this Centre for Information in 1992. It was decided at that stage that CIREFI was to be involved in the issues of illegal immigration and the smuggling of humans.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal requires the ‘enlargement countries" to cooperate where possible. However, in my view, it also raises quite a few doubts, just as the creation of the Centre did at the time. Firstly, it is difficult to understand why the Commission is not involved in this work, particularly as we approach the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam. This new communication also raises doubts in that respect, yet that is not the only thing that leads me to question its effectiveness and its purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, what kind of information do we hope to gather and how do we hope to gather it? Are we not aware of what is going on around us? I would be surprised if that were the case. In my view, nothing was as easy to foresee as the humanitarian crisis we are seeing on our television screens; nothing was as easy to foresee as the crisis that Europe is now experiencing in Kosovo. Equally, few things are as easy to foresee as the fact that in the months ahead, the Straits of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean will once again claim many people who, taking advantage of the good weather, will try to get across in tiny boats and vessels that are in terrible condition. We do not need warnings to advise us of that.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we know that illegal immigration causes great concern and Parliament hopes to act responsibly. As I said before, we are surprised at the lack of cooperation with the Commission. The Commission has the help of Eurostat and in the near future will be able to rely on the Schengen information system or the European information system. In my opinion, these elements would be perfectly adequate and we should not duplicate remits, duties or structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of all these doubts surrounding the future of this draft action and the Centre itself, I seriously considered rejecting this proposal. However, as was mentioned earlier, we are aware of the dramatic problems that the illegal trafficking of persons generates in Europe. We are therefore calling on the Council to put forward a new proposal for a regulation, in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam, within the next year. We are also asking it to include the Mediterranean region and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as an area for action under the scope of this new proposed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now go on to look at the opinion I drew up and the report presented by Mrs Reding on the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur very sincerely for her work and her ability to move such a controversial report forward in such a short time. I am sure all the Members of this House would like to thank her for enabling us to give our opinion on this issue at such an appropriate time and before we complete our work here.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Council"s document, particularly as it gives fresh impetus to a fundamental debate within the European institutions and between our institutions and the people of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to point out that our immigration policy and the treatment of ‘legal" immigrants in the European Union are going to become increasingly vital issues in our relations with third countries. An example of this is the talks we are currently holding with the Mediterranean countries on the conclusion of association agreements. I therefore believe that we should manage migratory flows not only on the basis of our internal policy, but also by taking account of the Union"s actions in other areas, such as the common foreign policy or our development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, dialogue with third countries, combined with measures aimed at development, is the most important element here. Indeed, such measures involve immigrants as they send a large proportion of their income to their families and this constitutes a significant amount of aid for both the families and the countries themselves. I must stress that dialogue is more important than joint action and more important than repressive measures or measures imposing our requirements on other countries. Dialogue is essential, a fact which is highlighted in the document.</p>
<p class="contents">There were certain elements that I was less satisfied with, and I am speaking now more on behalf of my group than on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Firstly, although we are pleased with this document, we would have been much happier – as I said in relation to the previous issue – if the Council had provided a strong impetus by approving the documents already on the table, which were presented by the Commission in recent months, not to mention years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring here to the convention for the protection of displaced persons, which was mentioned earlier and which we desperately need. I am also referring to the convention on rules for the admission of third‐country nationals. We would have preferred to receive a clear signal of support and approval for these measure, rather than an analysis of the issues, despite the fact that this in itself is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are seeing, we need an asylum policy and we need an immigration policy. I would like to take the few moments I have left to ask the Group of the European People"s Party to act in line with the House"s vote on the convention on rules for the admission of third‐country nationals, and, in relation to the debate initiated here by the Council, to vote in favour of the amendment calling for the rights of third‐country nationals residing legally in the Union to be regulated. To my mind, this issue is of vital importance.</p>

The first difficulty here was that we do not know the Council"s reaction to the opinion delivered by the European Parliament on this Convention. After all, the extensive data protection measures that we called for are at least as important for the additional protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion the second problem continues to be whether solely illegal entry or solely illegal residence is sufficient to justify such an encroachment on a person"s individual rights. On this point my view is quite different from that of Mr Pirker, who spoke earlier. After all, the person"s fingerprints are not just taken and compared but also stored for years to come. Is this really necessary? In any event, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot decide this because in my view it is a moral question. On the whole, it must be said that the Council has made significant efforts to draft a text that guarantees that stored fingerprints should be used to enforce the Dublin Convention, although in my opinion it has not gone far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clearly vote against an extension of the Eurodac database, as called for by the rapporteur. That is why we voted against it in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and spoke out against the adoption of this report. We did not ‘cave in", as the rapporteur said; however, we did express our opinion that we are not convinced that we can just treat people in this way. In my view a Europe in which all the data relating to a particular person can be retrieved at any time is not our Europe, nor does it correspond to my vision of Europe.</p>

Firstly, in recent years the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has highlighted time and time again the need for a harmonised approach to matters of asylum and migration. Resolutions were drawn up by Mr Wiebenga, by myself and by Mrs Lindeperg prior to the reports on our agenda now by Anna Terrón, Mrs Zimmermann, Mr Pirker and Mrs Reding. Mrs Reding"s report is a really good one, if I may say so.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also decided last year to set up a fund for refugees. In stark contrast to that, and this is my second point, we see the inability of the Council to be effective: inability to agree on how to admit refugees at the appropriate time and how to share the burdens; inability to agree a definition of what constitutes a refugee; inability to set up a common fund to pay for the reception, integration or return of those whose cases have been processed. It beggars belief that even in the terrible circumstances we are witnessing today, there is no will to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my third point, which is really a question. How can it be that the Council is working on a kind of negative accompanying policy which seems to suggest that harmonisation does in fact exist? Asylum seekers are not allowed to apply for asylum in more than one Member State, it was decided in Dublin. Hence a system called Eurodac, which enables this to be verified using asylum seekers" fingerprints. Parliament produced a consultation paper on this with a great deal of difficulty, because we really thought that it went much too far. But the Council"s intention to extend this system to illegals really is too much. We do not want police state operations, and nor do we want attacks of this kind on people"s physical integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">And I agree with what Mrs Zimmermann has already said. We want just one thing: an approach to European asylum policy which is at all times fast, efficient and humane. It is unfortunate that there are perforce no Commission initiatives in this area at present. I believe, and I wish to make the point, that Commissioner Gradin has done an extremely good job here. We are feeling the lack of a president because the Council is taking its time in putting together a new Commission, and I have to say that in this regard there is just one thing we need, namely a decision by the Council so that the matter can be addressed properly at last.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Esteban Martín </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, in this joint debate, the Community action programme to promote the integration of refugees – for which Mrs Zimmermann is rapporteur – has assumed particular importance in view of the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament had the foresight in 1997 to create a number of new lines in the budget which give the European Union the scope to implement specific measures in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to highlight the fact that the action plan will help us to coordinate Community initiatives and those of the Member States. In my view, this coordination is vital for the successful development of the action plan and we must therefore ensure that the various administrations involved collaborate in a clear and effective manner. The way the Commission has organised the pilot projects carried out in the last two years has not been particularly satisfactory, since the Member States have not been properly informed about the development of the projects and nothing has been done to help them to participate. Therefore, Commissioner, we must rectify these mistakes and try to make the most of the results of the measures taken earlier. In this respect, it might be useful to assess the results achieved through the earlier projects with a view to preventing any similar mistakes in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, given that the programme also aims to promote transnational cooperation, raise public awareness, and so on, it is important when trying to make the most of future actions to take other EU initiatives into account, such as those that come under the European Social Fund, the action plan to combat racism, or other programmes such as ‘Youth for Europe", which could also have repercussions on issues concerning refugees. We will thus be able to avoid a duplication and therefore dilution of any efforts made.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the joint action on voluntary repatriation, it is important to ensure that the aid is not used for this purpose alone, but is also used to improve the refugee reception centres in the Member States. In addition to improving the buildings, we must also allocate funds to train those working in the centres so that they can properly receive the refugees and provide them with the help they need for their future integration.</p>
<p class="contents">On another matter, and without going into an in‐depth analysis of the legal basis for the approval of the action plan – Article 235 – I simply want to point out that it might possibly have been better to wait until the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force and to adopt these measures under the framework of Community action to promote social integration, in accordance with the new Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, Commissioner, we are very much in favour of the adoption of these proposals and we hope that they can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wiebenga </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this debate is overshadowed by the war in Kosovo. For two years, the European Parliament and the Commission had been pressing the Council of Ministers for decisions on how to cope with refugees and how the financial burden should be shared in the event of major human disasters of the kind now happening in Kosovo. The European Union ought to have learned from its experience with the half a million refugees from Bosnia. The relevant legislative proposal, a form of joint action, was accepted last year by the European Parliament, but the Council of Ministers has done nothing about it. We have no system for the acceptance of refugees, although we do have a very small refugee fund of EUR 15 million or so. But on the other hand, virtually no financial provision has been made for emergency aid. All this is a sorry state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week"s decision of the Council of Justice Ministers about what to do with displaced persons from Kosovo said essentially that they should be taken in, in other words accepted in the Balkan region. That is in itself a good decision. I refer you, for example, to paragraph 26 of Mrs Reding"s excellent report. We must endeavour to make it possible for these people to go back to Kosovo as soon as possible, to their own homes, because ethnic cleansing cannot be accepted as a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency"s strategy paper is a good starting‐point for a new European policy on migration and asylum. But it should be the last paper. What we need now is legislation. Mrs d"Ancona has said this already. The previous paper, and it was not a Council one but a European Commission one – Commissioner Flynn issued it in 1994 – was virtually ignored. The debates on it, if I can mention merely one example, talked of the migration monitoring centre. This was a monitoring centre, a unit of the European Union, which was to have the remit of monitoring conditions in refugees" countries of origin. Nothing has come of it. And now, and I am looking here at Mrs Terrón i Cusí"s report, we are talking about an early warning system for illegal immigration, controlled by the Council of Ministers. That is not a good idea, because a monitoring centre for migration of the kind discussed earlier ought to come under the responsibility of the Commission, and should have a broader remit.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a European policy on asylum for the future, and we need it fast. The Tampere summit will be too late to help the Kosovars. But the Heads of Government should seize the chance to break the years of deadlock over the devising of a policy such as this, a uniform European policy on asylum, just as they did last year over monetary policy and as they did recently in Berlin over financial policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pailler </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, it is difficult not to be shocked and moved by the flood of Kosovar refugees fleeing the barbaric acts of the Serbian militias. Yet it is also difficult to ignore the hesitation and ambiguity of the Member States about accepting these refugees and their catastrophic inability to predict these obvious expulsions. They are hesitant to commit and share out the funds needed to accept the refugees, yet the high cost of the weapons used has never been challenged. They are ambiguous about the status of these refugees since certain Member States are only proposing to grant them territorial asylum with reduced rights, rather than strictly applying the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Such ambiguity is also evident in the presidency"s strategic document on immigration and asylum. The initial document from the Austrian Presidency created such an outcry that the German Presidency modified it. It clearly removed or watered down the most controversial aspects, but retained its fundamental approach, emphasising repressive action as well as the methods of preventing migratory flows into the European Union. Unfortunately, this document sticks very closely to the policy that is currently being followed in many Member States, a policy that is increasingly restrictive and repressive towards immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The immigration policy is considered first of all from a security viewpoint, with the construction of what amounts to a judicial and police barricade prohibiting access to the European area. Immigration is all too often wrongly linked to the rise in unemployment, a notion that has unfortunately been repeated here in the House. During a recent debate on a draft convention from the Commission, this House justified applying the Community preference – which is terrible in itself – and national preference in the field of employment. My group strongly condemns such moves and also opposes quotas on immigration. These quotas are based on neocolonial attitudes and their only aim is to select immigrants according to the European economy"s needs, both intellectually and in terms of manpower. I will continue to stress, here and elsewhere, that there is no correlation between immigration and the rate of unemployment, and studies by the OECD have demonstrated this. We must put an end to this strategy of finding scapegoats and rid ourselves of our obsession with security.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of regulating the status of illegal immigrants that is applied in certain Member States does exactly the opposite of this strategy, but we must not stop there. That is why my group is proposing in an amendment that the Member States should regulate the status of illegal immigrants, while respecting human rights and the relevant international conventions. I would call on our governments to ratify and implement all the international conventions, particularly the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families and the 1992 Council of Europe Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level. The provisions of these conventions should be included in the future Community policy on immigration and asylum provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, instead of this arsenal of administrative controls that simply increase in the number of files to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times, the right of asylum has become more and more restricted. In fact, in France, in 1997, 83 % of applications for asylum were rejected. These included applications from Algerian victims of terrorism and from Kurds who were the victims of oppression that was as severe as that now experienced by the people of Kosovo. The presidency"s strategic document does nothing to alter this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with other Members of this House, I have therefore signed the appeal backed by the High Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is unacceptable to allow Europe to enjoy the benefits of its economic and financial environment yet ignore the distress beyond its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to mention the analysis by the president of the European Union Migrants Forum, as it is also an appeal to all elected representatives and governments. In his view, those seeking asylum, refugees and migrants all form part of European society both now and in the future. Treating them as possible aggressors to be discouraged from approaching our prosperous Europe means that only the well‐off will be allowed into this very private club. And as far as the poor are concerned, be they nationals or those from other countries who have already arrived, all they have to do is wait and their turn will come. Indeed, in his opinion, they will soon be looked on more as intruders who should not have any rights and who deserve only hand‐outs. Our struggle is therefore a struggle on behalf of our entire democratic society. We are not only fighting for ourselves and for all those who have had the misfortune to be born with the wrong papers; we are also fighting to strengthen the democratic foundations of our societies.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Andrews </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, this report takes on an even wider significance following the tragic events in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, right in the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to refer in particular to the proposals on the fingerprinting of illegal immigrants. This is the thin edge of the wedge. It is Orwellian in its theory and probably, if it is ever put into practice, something even George Orwell would not have thought of. Instead of tattooing them, the modern‐day Europe is going to identify those who make us feel uncomfortable by fingerprinting. After immigrants, we take on the gypsies, then citizens we do not like the look of. Immigrants and those we feel uncomfortable with in society are branded, as criminals are today. I strongly oppose this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit there is no easy solution. If there was, it would have been found by now. Issues of high politics are caught up in issues of human rights. There is an overwhelming and immediate need to protect and care for the victims of war, to stop the genocide and to find a solution acceptable to all sides, including respect for and understanding of the needs of neighbouring countries. Top priority continues to be the need to protect and to care for the refugees. Families have been separated and sent to different countries. Refugees have died in holding pens in modern‐day Europe, without sanitation or proper services.</p>
<p class="contents">The UNHCR has been very slow to react, to say the very least. We have to act, as the interior ministers did last week, when they suggested that long‐term admission of Kosovars to countries outside the region would consolidate their displacement from their homes. We have to be certain that the wrong signals are not sent to the Serbian regime, that it is possible for the Kosovars to return home eventually to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcomed the launching of the general debate last year on a consistent approach to the questions of migration and asylum. The strategy paper, which has been under consideration in the Council, has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the present crisis we also welcome the fact that the strategy paper developed last year examined the possibility of making a single member of the Commission responsible for all matters relating to migration policy. This could be a significant advance given that at present several members of the outgoing Commission are responsible for different areas, which range from the legal aspects of migration, humanitarian aid and the free movement of persons to the foreign policy aspects of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the points set out in today's reports overlap as, for example, the services and reception facilities to be provided for asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the Commissioner. It may be my last opportunity to do so publicly. She has been a great asset to the Community and a great source of support on issues that have very often been discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. I wish to pay tribute to Mrs Gradin and wish her every success, whether she comes back or not.</p>

Even in the last few days it has become clear once again how urgently we need a European policy on refugees and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The atrocities, the expulsion and the genocide in Kosovo and the sometimes unpleasant way in which some Member States are dealing with the displaced persons who need our support illustrate once again that we need a harmonised policy on refugees and asylum, but one that must be humane in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The harmonised minimum level for certain services and reception facilities must apply to all EU Member States. We cannot have a situation in which some countries, like my country, Germany, bear a far heavier burden than others. This also applies to the area of migrant labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding"s report contains some very welcome demands for a differentiated approach involving three groups: refugees, migrant labour and the victims of smuggling networks. I would like to thank Mrs Reding on behalf of my group for presenting such a differentiated report.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what Mr Pirker said, it is not true that we did not or do not want a report on Eurodac. We wanted a report but not the one that Mr Pirker has given us. We would have liked to have discussed and adopted a critical report, which is what our voters elected us to do and expect of us. When it comes to civil rights and avoiding the same old arguments we have a huge responsibility, even here in the House. That is why we rejected his report: because it was not appropriate for this House.</p>

I must point out that it follows on from the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency. This initially led to some controversy but it also opened a debate that has proved to be quite fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">The report analyses four key problems. The first relates to the right of asylum, its unique characteristics and all the other rights that correspond to it. The second involves immigrant labour and the mobility of the labour force. The third point highlights the problem of the illegal immigration networks, whilst the fourth deals with the statute for legal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, a certain vagueness surrounded all these concepts, a sense of confusion, which, helped along by ideology – even passion – and demagogy, led to very serious problems. I need look no further for proof of this than the words of our colleague Mr Pirker, who just accused the left of caving in to its own supporters. I must point out to him that the immigrant supporters are not necessarily the best we can find.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the right of asylum is concerned, it is important to stress that everyone has the right to request asylum and that the Geneva Conventions – the conventions themselves and the additional protocols – which are the founding texts, represent a frame of reference that cannot be violated. We need to think very carefully about the proposed replacements, which the report very clearly rejects.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also stresses that there should be minimum standards for the services and reception facilities to which asylum seekers are entitled. It highlights, too, that we need to respect the conventions, speed up procedures and, above all, guarantee the rights of those seeking asylum until a final decision has been taken by the judicial authorities to proceed with deportation. Finally, we should pay tribute to the genuine efforts being made to reconcile the judicial proceedings and regulations involved with the human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">After the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission will be able to take legislative initiatives. If the Commission continues along the same path it has followed until now – and perhaps we should pay tribute to the Commission today, particularly as we do not do so very often at the moment – it should be aware that it will find in Parliament, be it this Parliament or its successor, a reliable and faithful ally.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindeperg </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, Parliament previously expressed its support for the Eurodac Convention. We were told at the time that it was designed to make it easier to apply the Dublin Convention by offering security both to those seeking asylum, who would be assured that they could apply for asylum in a Member State, and also to the countries themselves, since the system enabled us to prevent multiple applications.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reasons given by the Council today, to which the rapporteur has just given his support, for extending Eurodac to include certain categories of illegal immigrants through a protocol are far from convincing. We feel that the risk of abuse here is quite considerable. Our group therefore hopes that the protocol will be rejected, just as the entire committee hoped that it would be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I do not have time to talk about the excellent reports by Mrs Terrón and Mrs Zimmermann, but I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mrs Reding. I must congratulate her because, although dealing with a very sensitive and controversial subject, she has succeeded in finding compromises on most issues and they are likely to be supported by the vast majority here. At the same time, she has also managed to maintain the fundamental points and principles that I and my group fully supported and that she herself has just explained very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">We were somewhat concerned about certain aspects of the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency and, in our view, it was vital that the report should set out these concerns very clearly. The first of these relates to the necessary distinction between the problem of asylum and that of immigration. The implications of this are very important, particularly as regards access to the territory of Europe and, thus, access to the procedure put in place for the many people applying for asylum who, for reasons that are very easy to understand, do not have the relevant documents. We must not liken these people to illegal immigrants; that would be like riding roughshod over the principle that asylum seekers should not be expelled or returned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the report is very clear on the fact that we must ensure the full and complete application of the Geneva Convention and refuse to accept any attempt to renegotiate it. The gaps in the Convention need to be filled, particularly through the creation of a statute on complementary protection, but under no circumstances must we replace the Convention itself. Furthermore, we strongly oppose a policy based on an ‘institutional offer" at the discretion of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is our request for a broad interpretation of the Geneva Convention, particularly as regards taking account of persecution by third parties. Parliament has often expressed its view on this issue, yet there has not been the slightest shift in the Council"s position or in the measures taken by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the tragic events we are currently witnessing prove that it was vital to express our disapproval of the fact that the joint actions proposed by the Commission on the temporary protection of displaced persons have been blocked in the Council, and many of the speakers here have mentioned this. Commissioner Gradin had hoped to learn from the experience of the Bosnian tragedy, and quite rightly so. Unfortunately, the Council"s procrastination has meant that the system she is proposing cannot be implemented to help tackle the tragedy in Kosovo, and this does Europe no credit. Although the refugees from Kosovo are apparently covered by the Geneva Convention, such massive immigration flows clearly prevent us from considering each case individually in a short period of time and using the normal processes. Temporary protection would undoubtedly be the appropriate instrument in such cases, but without permanently ruling out the possibility of invoking the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the report by Mrs Reding. However, I would point out that, despite its merits, we are unfortunately left to wonder how effective it will be, as until now the Council has not paid a great deal of attention to the very many consistent recommendations Parliament has made.</p>

It is necessary because asylum and immigration will be communitised with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Even if they are dependent on unanimous Council decisions for the next five years, they will still be removed from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferred to the Community. This means that in the areas of asylum and immigration we must force ourselves to think in Community terms, and that is the task of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on one point here. I believe that we in Europe and here in the European Parliament must answer one question very clearly, a question that is fundamental to this whole discussion: generally speaking, do we in Europe want to take in immigrants or not? And here I am not talking about political refugees. There is absolutely no question that these are to be taken in, a point which cannot seriously be disputed by anyone. I am not talking either about civil war refugees, other quota refugees or family reunification. I am discussing only the basic issue of whether we in Europe wish to take in immigrants, as we are occasionally asked to do. Here I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that Europe is not an immigration area like the United States was in the last century and possibly still is today, or like Australia, New Zealand, Canada or any other countries which desperately sought people to fill up their space. We are not in that situation: on the contrary, we have 20 million unemployed. As a result of this we have no choice but to restrict immigration. I would like to emphasise once again that I am not talking about asylum and related issues but only about immigration, and particularly illegal immigration. In my view it is irresponsible to reject the Eurodac Convention when we consider that 80 % of illegal immigrants are victims of trafficking networks that cynically exploit the misery and suffering of these people. One of the things that is needed in order to put a stop to their activities is the signing of the Eurodac Convention. Those who reject is are playing straight into the hands of the smuggling networks by voting against it. Please consider this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of asylum we are essentially in agreement. Everyone here is in favour of granting asylum to the victims of political persecution. We now need to settle the matter of the procedure. Should all asylum seekers in Europe have an individual procedure or must we resign ourselves to considering institutional guarantees? I believe that speedy processing is particularly in the interest of applicants for asylum. For this reason we must open up this second possibility.</p>

I must say that there is nothing I would have put differently, especially when I have in my hand two pages of conclusions reached during the meeting of justice and foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg last week. One might ask oneself whether this is really the outcome of a conference attended by 15 ministers: an expression of thanks to Albania and a statement to the effect that we are prepared to provide protection for refugees from the Kosovo region. Is this the level of solidarity we are able to display in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">We are capable of action when 2 000 Kurds are knocking at our doors, but not when hundreds of thousands of people are suffering. We have a collective responsibility for the tens of thousands of people who have vanished and for those who will probably die of starvation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to all those countries that have talked about a European identity and the importance of solidarity to do something in the present situation. I also have to say that today I am ashamed of being Finnish. We have a prime minister who might very well not have seen on television over Easter or even be aware of the anxiety and suffering in Kosovo. I apologise for being Finnish, but I am nevertheless pleased that our government has at last done something, since that is what people want. Our solidarity is being put to the test.</p>
<p class="contents">We must hold our ground in the European Parliament. In particular, we must stand firm over the proposal relating to a European fund for refugees and for increased Community resources directed at those in need.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sjöstedt </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, so far the EU's policy on refugees has consisted solely of restrictive measures. The Dublin Convention and Eurodac should also be viewed in the same light. In practical terms, moreover, the Schengen Agreement has played a major role in generally making it more difficult for asylum seekers to persuade the EU authorities to look into their reasons for requesting asylum. EU policy bears the stamp of repression and police involvement, which in turn explains – or very largely explains – the growing influx of illegal immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required instead is, above all, a shared responsibility throughout the whole of Europe, and not just in the EU, for those who need protection. We also need rules based on the UN Convention on the status of refugees to ensure that they are well treated. In addition, there should be a means of guaranteeing the rights of those who are legally resident within the EU, for example their right to be able to move around freely within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurodac is central to the system devised under the Dublin Convention for applying the principle of the first country of asylum. This principle has numerous shortcomings, as does Eurodac itself. The principle of the first country of asylum is currently being applied, in spite of the fact that the Member States acknowledge that differences exist between asylum seekers. The principle is irrational and may well lead to arbitrary decisions being made. Secondly, there is also an obvious danger of the Eurodac register expanding and being abused. And thirdly, fingerprinting infringes the integrity of the person and should only be done where it is genuinely necessary. Today's proposal on Eurodac should therefore be rejected in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words about the Reding report concerning the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy. Last year, the Austrian Presidency put forward an exceptionally cynical proposal regarding the EU's future asylum policy. It constituted what amounts to a frontal attack on the foundations of a humane asylum policy. Consequently, I welcome the fact that, on a number of important points, Mrs Reding disagrees with the proposal, particularly in her defence of the Geneva Convention and the role of the UNHCR.</p>

It was against this background that we created a regulation concerning third countries which is clearly contrary to the Geneva Convention but also does not do anything to combat abuse. It was against this background that we removed persecution by non‐state violence from the grounds for recognising refugee status. It was against this background that the Austrian Presidency"s strategy paper on refugees ultimately came into being, which represents a clear attack on the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">But even if these Members really were only concerned with abuse and not, as Mr Nassauer said, with the actual refugees, then today we have come to the moment of truth, Mr Pirker, Mr Nassauer: today 200 000 people are fleeing Kosovo, and they are being denied refugee status in violation of the Geneva Convention. Why do you not stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention, which clearly provides protection for people who are persecuted for ethnic reasons, be observed? Then stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention be observed and that these people be granted refugee status!</p>

It is cynical to be talking of a strategy which should result in a common approach of the Union at the autumn summit in Tampere, when the Council meeting in Luxembourg could not even agree a joint strategy for the admission of refugees in one of the biggest humanitarian disasters which Europe has even seen.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it shameful that the European Union, which is wealthy and prosperous, merely salves its conscience by giving a few tens of millions of euros in aid to the region. In all honesty, Commissioner, I cannot understand either the stance expressed by Mrs Bonino on behalf of the Commission that she was against settling refugees in the European Union. Of course it is good to keep people in their own area, always provided it can be done in decent conditions. But the television pictures and the reports from humanitarian organisations have shown us clearly that this is not possible, that the countries bordering on Kosovo are, moreover, too poor and too unstable to be able to cope with this influx appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">The political reluctance shown by some Member States of the Union is disgraceful too. Nevertheless, this strategy document says quite clearly that the European Commission"s proposals for acceptance of refugees, which have been on the table for two years already, as Mr Wiebenga rightly pointed out, must be approved as speedily as possible. So I think this debate should prompt us to urge the Council once again – and forcefully – to conclude an agreement without delay on collective action on refugees and on a statute giving them guaranteed rights and protection. If the 15 cannot manage this, Commissioner, I am convinced that those Member States which do wish to cooperate will have to conclude an agreement on how to deal with refugees – a kind of humanitarian Schengen, if I can call it that. I am not at all pro‐Schengen, but in this case it seems to me to be absolutely the right course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise another point which is terribly important both in Mrs Reding"s report and in the crisis in Kosovo. I refer to the reuniting of families. Every day on television we see the tragedy of families which have become separated, of children, men and women who cannot find each other. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives everyone the right to live in a family. That right must be upheld for refugees and displaced persons too. That right must be guaranteed by the Union for refugees from Kosovo and for any other asylum seeker or refugee. I think we urgently need to revise and add to the Dublin agreement on this point. The yawning gap which divides the few good proposals contained in the strategy paper and European dithering in this area – I have no other word for it – shows that it will really take a miracle if we are to achieve anything specific at Tampere. I hope the Commission will show perseverance and I hope Parliament will continue to be involved in preparing policy, because the Council gives the impression of having to protect Europe against the refugees, rather than wanting to protect the refugees themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">When talking about immigration, in my view, there are two key elements: solidarity and the human dimension of the problem. Solidarity is important because every human being, irrespective of nationality, sex or religion, has the right to a decent life and to sufficient resources to enable him to survive. We cannot understand immigration if we are only concerned about our own borders, our own welfare or our own geostrategic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The human dimension also requires considerable efforts on the part of the Member States if it is to be reconciled with the legislation needed to regulate the entry and exit of third‐country nationals or a period of residence in our countries by those who are seeking work, refuge or asylum from persecution in their own countries. We must finally introduce a common policy to regulate the administrative and judicial procedures involved. This policy must allow us to pursue and sentence those who exploit human beings. It must also help us to ensure that the most fundamental rights of any immigrants in our countries, be they legal or illegal, will be respected, even in instances where they have to be expelled or returned to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not only the responsibility of the European Union. It is also up to the countries from which the immigrants come to strive to make the most of the human and material resources they have available, that is, both their own resources and those provided by the European Union in the form of assistance. They must also become more democratic and guarantee respect for their citizens" rights.</p>

<p class="contents">Can the European Union be regarded as a place of freedom, security and justice? Can it follow a progressive policy on asylum and refugees?</p>
<p class="contents">Two very recent traumatic experiences probably provide a negative answer. Firstly, the barbarous bombardments by NATO of Yugoslavia, which are creating hundreds of thousands of refugees and threatening to destabilise the whole of the Balkans. Secondly, the three‐month‐long wanderings of Mr Öcalan throughout Europe, who not only did not find asylum but was essentially handed over to his persecutors with the help of procedures that were suspect and illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot debate in the European Parliament as if these things had not happened. The policy of the European Union towards the major migration crisis we are witnessing is a policy of containment. It is a policy of war and one which, as the presidency"s strategy paper on migration and asylum policy points out, calls for actions that could have a good chance of success, but only if they are not carried out exclusively on a political level and only if they comprise as broad a spectrum of actions as possible, which may even include war, as indeed we are witnessing at the moment. This policy even goes so far as to call into question the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, regarding it as outdated, and calls for a complementary system of protection which, to all intents and purposes, will be based on mechanisms such as Schengen and Europol. In other words, what we have is the logic of militarism and of the police state.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we denounce this policy as inhuman and hypocritical, as a policy which in the end will not protect the paradise that is Europe, but which, sooner or later, will lead it into adventures that will damage not only the people of Europe and democracy but, above all, peace in Europe and throughout the world.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, first let me congratulate the four rapporteurs involved in this joint debate on migration, asylum and refugees: Mrs Zimmermann, Mrs Terrón i Cusi, Mrs Reding and Mr Pirker. It is impossible for me in three minutes to discuss adequately the details of these four complex reports, ranging from early warning systems for illegal immigration to integration of refugees, from migration policy to fingerprinting applicants for asylum. Instead I will try to touch on a number of principles which I believe should be the basis for the policy that we pursue in all of these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First let me say that the European Union must have the ability to make choices as to the immigration policy it wishes to pursue. With a borderless Europe these choices can only be made together, rather than separately. Our current policy limits immigration to a few cases of family reunion, plus some German and Greeks from the former Soviet Union who are entering their own countries. Provided that, in the future, such policies are arrived at in a non‐racist way, by open and democratic debate, then I can support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to make it clear that asylum seekers and refugees are not immigrants. Sometimes this is an issue that is confused. Our responsibility with regard to their applications for asylum or for refugee status go further than with respect to immigration. It is inhuman for us to send people back to face torture, physical abuse and death. Of course some individuals will try to abuse the system – just like Members of the European Parliament! – I do not see that refugees and asylum seekers are any different. I have no problem, therefore, in supporting measures to prevent multiple applications.</p>
<p class="contents">My problem is a different one: I will not repeat my colleagues' comments, particularly those from the Socialist Group, on what is happening in Kosovo but I will reiterate a point I made in an earlier debate. Some years ago Member States of the European Union were refusing applications for asylum from those courageous individuals in Serbia who had refused to be conscripted to join in ethnic cleansing. That crime may well have contributed to the larger crimes being carried out against the Kosovo Albanians while we speak. The refusal rate is not a measure of need, but a measure of failure of will and courage by Member States who are refusing to recognise that the level of valid applications may well be substantially above the level of those currently granted either permanent or temporary leave to remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, within the Union we have four million black Europeans and 12 to 14 million third country nationals. We have a responsibility to ensure not only that all citizens have the same rights and same duties within the European Union but so do all residents. It is only then that we can build the kind of Europe that I would like to see.</p>

In the previous debate, I said that we are at a stage where European public opinion is very much aware that it wants Europe to be more than just a market; it wants Europe to be a project for civilization. And the best way of seeing exactly what we want Europe to be is by looking at how we present ourselves, how we present our internal environment to those who knock on our door, be they immigrants, those seeking asylum or refuge, or displaced persons. That is why today"s reports are so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress one aspect that has already been mentioned, but that, in my view, has perhaps not received the attention it deserves, namely, the legal framework. Parliament often tends to be proactive here. I believe that the legal framework is our safeguard and our responsibility. It represents the defence of the weakest, in other words those who, in this case, are seeking asylum. It is Parliament"s responsibility to defend it as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, we must interpret the Treaty of Amsterdam as broadly and as boldly as we can, yet we must not go beyond its framework. If that is not sufficient, then we must hold an intergovernmental conference to revise the Treaty. What we do not want to see in this process of European integration that we all desire is a violation of the Treaty, through the back door and by means of concrete measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Two specific questions remain in relation to the reports. As far as the Eurodac report is concerned, we are now waiting to see what approach the Commission regulation takes under the new legal bases. We must also recognise that at this stage the political focus of the document is incomplete. It does not contain all of Parliament"s beliefs and wishes, nor, I am sure, does it include all that the Commission hopes for. This must be resolved so that it does not appear as if this is our position on Eurodac.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mrs Reding"s report, which is very important, extremely interesting and comprehensive, I would merely like to take these last 30 seconds to highlight the issue of respect for the legal framework, which I have already mentioned. Mrs Reding has reached an interesting compromise between our desire to stretch the Treaty to its limits and ensuring that we do not go too far and allow it to snap.</p>

What is real is the challenge presented by hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo. What is real, Madam Commissioner, is the scandalous meeting held by the Council of Ministers, at which it recently decided not to bear the costs of relieving the refugees" suffering, and to place the burden on neighbouring countries. However, these countries are unable to assume this burden, either economically, politically or socially. The destabilisation of these countries is beginning to unfold, and when this happens the Council and, I imagine, the Commission too, will not have the legal basis to help there either.</p>
<p class="contents">They told us hypocritically that they want the refugees to stay in the area, so as not to send the wrong political message to Mr Milosevic. Just hark at that! In other words, the messages sent by the missiles and the bombs are not enough? Will the refugees become messages too? Shame! Or are our leaders anticipating a swift solution to the crisis? Judging by the credibility of their forecasts thus far... What can I say! Dark vistas are opening up for the refugees and for the neighbouring countries!</p>
<p class="contents">This debate, Madam Commissioner, could become less unrealistic if both Parliament and the Commission found a way to call on the Council urgently on whatever legal basis to immediately re‐examine its position, which is unacceptable and befitting of Pontius Pilate. As for the rest, dealing with this at intergovernmental level and within the Community, and all the things that have been quite correctly said here, we can examine them in the future. The present is here and it is posing a multitude of threats.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Mr President, one of last year's most important initiatives was the Austrian proposal concerning immigration and asylum policy, which triggered a much‐needed debate both in the Council of Ministers and in this House. Mrs Reding also attaches great importance to the initiative in her report. I share her view that immigration and asylum should be treated as separate issues and, furthermore, this was one of the aspects I raised when the Austrian Presidency submitted its first draft. I also agree with the rapporteur that immigration should not be regarded as a problem; it can be an asset, and is a natural part of the life of the international community. It is something we must learn to understand, accept and deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, the rules on immigration vary from one country to another. The Commission has therefore submitted a proposal for closer approximation of the rules. Amongst other things, we have raised the issue of the fundamental rights of immigrants, particularly as regards their access to the European labour market. Naturally, I am hoping for strong support from the Council of Ministers, as well as from Parliament. For my own part, the situation of immigrants in the community is the most crucial element. As Mr Ford has said, this concerns the living conditions of some ten million people who have been residing legally in our Member States for many years. Some clear political signals are therefore required.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the battle against illegal immigration must be stepped up. So long as immigration is subject to regulation, people will try to circumvent the mechanisms of control. This has led to the existence of a large‐scale market in the smuggling of human beings. It also lies behind the proposal for a system for rapidly exchanging information on illegal immigration, which Mrs Terrón i Cusí deals with in her report. I regard this proposal as an important part of our efforts to effectively tackle the cynical practice of trafficking in women for sexual purposes which is taking place throughout Europe. It is especially important that such a system should also include all the Central and Eastern European countries. During the past year, we have seen far too many women from those countries, who are being exploited in this way, on the streets and in the brothels of our capital cities. Ever since I first arrived in Brussels, I have been striving to get this issue onto the EU's agenda. The problem is that we have only a limited knowledge of the details of people smuggling, and in particular of what is actually taking place in the countries of origin. A system for exchanging information such as that described in the resolution would represent a considerable step forward. We need to be able to find out more quickly, for example, when new illegal smuggling organisations are discovered in the countries of origin. Our knowledge of smuggling tactics and methods, as well as the routes used, also needs to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">From the report, it is clear that Mrs Terrón i Cusí would prefer the Commission to be responsible for managing an information system of this kind. I appreciate her confidence. The Commission's role in the area of migration policy will be increased in the next few years with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. In the short term, however, it is essential to ensure that the work continues as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1951 Geneva Convention provides a sound basis for a common refugee policy. At the same time, the convention will soon be celebrating its half century. The world has changed in the intervening years, and the refugee situation with it. Many of those who need protection today do not fulfil the criteria established during the cold war era. Moreover, we are increasingly being confronted by refugee crises on a massive scale which flare up quickly. Other, supplementary instruments are therefore now required. The need for protection should always take precedence over formal rules. The refugee crisis which we are now witnessing in Kosovo is merely the latest tragic example.</p>
<p class="contents">On countless occasions during the past four and a half years, I have called in vain for Europe to equip itself with new asylum instruments to supplement the Geneva Convention in precisely this kind of situation. Moreover, I have launched several initiatives to bring such instruments into existence: one on temporary protection, another on burden sharing, and a third that would increase the effectiveness of the asylum process. I appreciate the support which I have had from this House for the last initiative. On the other hand, the Council of Ministers withdrew its support when the members saw its actual implications. Nor have we made much progress on temporary shelter or burden sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Europe will continue to shoulder its responsibilities as regards the crisis in Kosovo. Last week's special ministerial meeting also gave a clear indication in this respect. Already, a massive effort is under way to help the whole region to cope with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who now find themselves in Albania, FYROM and Montenegro. Moreover, further help is on the way, both from the Member States and the Commission. The Member States have also, in different ways, expressed their willingness to receive refugees in their own countries if no other alternative is available. At the same time, it is worrying that we have not learned anything from our costly experiences in the war in Bosnia. The war in Kosovo has shown yet again that Europe must equip itself with a coordinated refugee policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect concerns the integration of refugees into the community. Mrs Zimmermann, in her report, lays great stress on an integrated approach. I totally agree with that. The Commission has submitted two separate proposals: one to encourage the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees and another on integration. The rapporteur questions this approach. I share her basic viewpoint, but since the Amsterdam Treaty has not yet entered into force, there was no practicable alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">I might also mention that the German Presidency, in its conclusions resulting from last week's ministerial meeting, decided that the Commission should revise the section relating to the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees in order to make use of the EU's release of EUR 15 million for the refugee crisis in Kosovo. I have already approved the original proposal, and I have the support of my colleagues for tomorrow's meeting of the Commission. I also assume that I have the support of the Council of Ministers, as well as of this House. We should also hold a joint discussion, at the earliest opportunity, on whether this amount is in fact proportionate to the level of need.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I note that as regards the proceedings of the committee, Mrs Zimmermann takes the view that they should be as simple as possible. I wholeheartedly agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words about the Pirker report and Eurodac, the European system for the comparison of fingerprints. It is very important to have such a system in place. It is a precondition for the application, as envisaged, of the principle of the first country of asylum and the provisions of the Dublin Convention. As you know, the Council of Ministers has now finalised the wording of Eurodac and asked the Commission to revise the proposal so that it is in accordance with the terms of the new Treaty. The intention is therefore to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force, and in this way to strengthen both the democratic and legislative control.</p>
<p class="contents">All the issues we deal with in the area of justice and home affairs affect European citizens in their daily lives. In a sense, it is paradoxical that internal European cooperation, which has the greatest impact on people's lives, is something they know least about. The introduction of more openness and transparency in our working methods would be a way of changing this. Another way would be to ensure that we can arrive at some concrete decisions on certain key migration issues. People should be able to see that what we are doing is having some effect. A good deal of political will is also needed if we are to make the right decisions during the coming year. I therefore regret that the requirement for unanimity will continue for the next five years. It is certainly true that cooperation in this area is still a sensitive issue, particularly with regard to immigration policy. Therefore, a very important task for the coming years is to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in the EU's efforts in that area to allow the introduction of qualified majority voting to become a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must give the concepts of freedom, security and justice enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty a clear and precise meaning. The Tampere summit in the autumn will therefore be a milestone. Parliament also has a very important mission to perform. Clear signals must be given on the direction which European immigration and asylum policy needs to take. I also think that the two debates we have had tonight have been valuable in illustrating how important that is.</p>
