This proposal for a Council Regulation is the first in a series which will make it possible to draw up this reform. The collection and management of the fisheries data is needed to conduct the common fisheries policy. This data must be reliable, drawn up independently and accepted by all the operators in the industry, politicians and those individuals responsible for the application of this CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries. All the members of our Group voted in favour of these amendments, both in committee and in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably. Specifically, the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use. Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities. It is, however, crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal. What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses. In addition to the extremely high cost of such a proposal, the cumbersome nature of its management may cause some administrations to use its complexities as a pretext not to provide the information in due time and may give rise to a certain feeling of suspicion among the people working in the sector if they have onerous additional bureaucratic constraints foisted upon them in this way. Regarding the second part of this amendment, it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly. Let us not forget that in the administration of a common fisheries policy the statistical analysis used must include the social aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect: the collection of environmental data. The value of this can be gauged from the particularly serious effects caused by failing to take data of this type into account, for example, in the case of the decision on the prohibition of drift gillnets, which is totally unjustifiable from the environmental standpoint, since they are one of the most selective types of fishing gear that exist. If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data, then the Commission would be able unilaterally, just as it pleases, to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities, including national and regional authorities, in order to contribute to the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal. Effectively, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable in order to allow an operational overview of fishing activities without compromising essential rights to confidentiality, for example, in fiscal matters, where the Community has no jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission’s participation in the inspection procedure. It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001. In fact, because the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002, it is essential that all the political participants should be given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information which will form the basis of the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood, faecal matter, mucus, etc. There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe. It is, however, recognised that other species such as trout, eels or herring, may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it. The disease was detected in Norway in 1984 and also in Canada (1996). The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26° C, and is therefore not dangerous to humans.</p>
<p class="contents">The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry. It was detected in this region in May 1998. Today, 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA. It is therefore essential to contain this disease and prevent it spreading to all the aquacultural establishments in the various Member Sates of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council proposal envisages setting up a system for the gradual elimination of fish affected by the disease and also a vaccination plan. We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish. The fish farms concerned must be assisted in ‘cleaning up’ the infected site and preventing the disease from spreading through the commercial transport of live fish. As regards vaccination, we should remember that the initial directive prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA. The Commission’s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines, but it is important to point out that so far, no vaccine has actually been found. The usefulness of this proposal is limited, to say the least, certainly in the short term. Canada does have a vaccine with a 76% success rate. Since the Canadian strain differs from the European strain, this vaccine cannot be used in its present state, but may be used as the starting point for the development of a vaccine against the European strain. It is therefore crucial for the Commission to earmark sufficient funding to support the development of an effective vaccine against the European strain of ISA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1994, the Green Group was the first group in this Parliament to have a majority of women in it, the Greens were the first group to have a woman secretary-general in Dominique Voinet, now the French Environment Minister, and the German Greens were the first political party to operate gender parity in order to redress the overall under-representation of women in political institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This lead has since been followed by a number of parties and it cannot be said that the electorate have risen in protest to condemn such parties for their actions. Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas. The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women’s representation and that all political parties must take action. We look forward to that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits; they should be. Our culture should allow for a balance between the sexes and people should be able to develop their talents wherever they lie, but our culture and values at the moment do not reflect that belief. Prejudice and stereotyping are widespread and is it any wonder that people who come from minority groups whether black, gay, physically handicapped or whatever face discrimination and unfair treatment when a majority group, women, also face such discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our Group supports positive action and only when women are fairly represented in positions of decision making will men also be fairly represented. We might also then develop a culture where your paid and unpaid work, your pay packet, your parental leave and your pension are not determined by your sex.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I shall most decidedly be voting in favour of the text of this resolution which urges us to take more proactive measures to combat the residual discrimination preventing women occupying their rightful place in our society!</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1995, promoting women in the decision-making process has been one of the priority areas of the European Union action programme for equal opportunities, and is included among the commitments reiterated both by the Union institutions and by the Member States when they discuss equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, even though progress has been made in recent years thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and complementary schemes such as positive action, they are still too few in number to be satisfactory. Under-representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be the norm.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of enabling greater numbers of women to become involved in politics is, however, recognised. Only women are in a position to come up with policies likely to change structures which have been developed by men for men. For, whether in politics or in the labour market, structural discrimination is the main problem facing women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus up to the European political parties to make themselves more accessible to women. Moreover, Article 191 of the Treaty (ex Article 138a) stresses, political parties are, I quote, “important as a factor for integration within the Union”. This article goes on to state that “they contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union”. A condition of this type may have no legal value, but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value. It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe. This may, for example, involve implementing positive action and promoting parity within our political parties. In the 1999 European elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented. This is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely. I do not know if there is some cause-and-effect at work here, but the fact is that the proportion of female Members in the European Parliament went from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999. Moreover, this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by repeating the conclusions of the conference organised by the Commission in April 1999 entitled “Women and men in power”. Equality between men and women is not a problem that affects women alone, but one that affects our entire society! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our own Institution, 30% of elected representatives are now women, including the President of the European Parliament itself. Finland too has just elected a female President. On average, one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments. This is still far from satisfactory, especially given that the figures vary enormously between Member States where the Nordic countries experience a much higher female representation in positions of responsibility and decision making. This situation has more to do with attitude and respect for the quality and abilities of women’s contributions to society than fixed quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group does not favour the use of quotas in general since, in the long run, they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause they aim to support. Nevertheless, we recognise that the experience in all Member Sates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified, as a temporary remedy, to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under-represented. We were able to support the resolution on women in decision making, adopted with a view to commemorating International Women’s Day on 8 March, which has incorporated ten Liberal Group amendments and softened the reference to quotas in line with the approach outlined above.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men’s work more than women’s. Wages are not equal, women’s work is still perceived as ‘stop-gap’ work and, more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. What is more, women bear the main responsibility for family matters. </p>

I shall continue by deploring the excessively cautious approach of the right wing in the European Parliament which, by adopting a whole raft of amendments, has robbed my colleague’s work of its substance!</p>
<p class="contents">This report, let me remind you, is based on the Commission’s annual economic report for 1999, the first of these to be published under the euro system, which, consequently, is more concerned with the single European economy than with a series of national economies. The European Parliament had the option to take this opportunity to put forward imaginative and ‘proactive’ proposals, according to the rapporteur’s own description, with a view to giving European Union economic activities a new orientation. One observation is unavoidable: Europe has unparalleled potential for economic and social progress which, for reasons that still partly escape us, remains largely unexploited, hence the highly interesting suggestions made in the initial report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to regenerate economic activity by setting ambitious goals (an employment rate of 75%, an upturn in growth, etc.) and by setting aside sufficient resources to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial proposals suggested that the Council in particular should bring in measures with a view to ensuring full employment which would still be consistent with price stability and the budgetary balance of the entire economic cycle. It is not in fact a matter, as some would have us believe, of challenging the policy of stability we adopted some years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Some measures, particularly on tax, must be adopted to encourage private and public investment. We must get the programme of Trans-European Networks, as proposed in 1994, back on track, we must initiate a major research and development programme in order to ensure that investments necessarily have an innovative content. Why do we think that investment should not be used as an instrument for managing demand but should rather be practised for its own sake?</p>
<p class="contents">We must encourage better management of working time and the dissemination of policies of good practice within Member States in order to increase levels of employability, particularly among the most disadvantaged sectors of the working population. Some measures such as retraining, in the form of lifelong training, seem particularly relevant. These must be an integral part of the on-going institutional transformation which must support the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A proposal of this type brings us back into line with the thinking adopted for the Special Summit on employment which is to take place in Lisbon in March.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these measures, which are too proactive in the eyes of some of those on the right, have, of course, been brushed aside. I must condemn this! An amendment referring to taxation on speculative capital transfers also suffered the same fate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do, however, deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution. Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing. It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities. It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds, inadequate funds moreover, which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings.</p>
<p class="contents">Confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue. Whatever the flag of convenience used by Total, the oil company responsible is widely known and represented in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could, if they were so inclined, seize all of its assets until the company makes payment. We feel we must condemn, above all, this economy in which, in order to make extra profits, a firm can ruin a region with pollution in the same way that it can ruin a region by closing factories. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter. </p>
<p class="contents">It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in order to ensure that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast. This is the seventh time that Brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the <span class="italic">Torrey Canyon</span> shipwreck.</p>
<p class="contents">No other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea. Together with our friends from the UDB, I would argue in favour of two important guidelines relating to the complete overhaul of the world’s merchant navy and the protection of the Breton coast (proposals also to be found in the draft resolution which has just been approved). </p>
<p class="contents">At EU level we would like to see one single piece of legislation drawn up for shipping, encompassing all its technical, commercial, social and environmental aspects. Without exception, the risky practices of flags of convenience must be banned in the ports and waters of the fifteen Member States and thirteen applicant States. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, together with the UDB, we would argue in favour of establishing coastguard services and appointing maritime inspectors to work under the direct supervision of the relevant shipping areas and monitor the strict observance of European legislation. The draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect, and our Group has therefore given it its full backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Group made a great contribution to drafting this resolution. It takes far better account than our previous resolution of the extent of the disaster, which every day seems to get far worse than anticipated on first analysis and is becoming more exacting, clearer and more urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage it is still difficult to assess the total damage caused to all the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors. We do already know, however, that it will be extensive. Every day, further pollution increases the toll. The degradation does not affect just business turnover but also valuable parts of our heritage. The effect upon the brand image of seafood products is hard to calculate today. It is also essential to include the damage suffered by businesses both upstream and downstream (the fish trade, service providers, tourism, etc.) and the overall costs incurred by the authorities in eliminating pollution and restoring the reputation of the tourist industry. Fishing and tourism, as the two chief resources in most of the regions on our Atlantic coastline, have therefore both been hard hit.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need to clearly stipulate, as our resolution does, the principle of ‘polluter cleans’ and the principle of ‘polluter pays’. It is in fact the job of the polluters to pay the costs for cleaning the areas suffering as a result of their actions, and for the restoration of the ecological balance damaged by their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the compensation system, the citizens are anxious because FIPOL’s initial compensation payments to victims have been limited to 25%. This is just scandalous. Quite obviously all victims should receive 100% compensation. It would be quite unthinkable to insist that victims should bear any part of the costs of the damages they have suffered due to the incompetence of a polluter.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution further welcomes the initiatives taken by a number of local authorities, such as the French department of Vendée, to draw up a precise assessment of the state of the coast prior to the arrival of the first waves of the oil slick. This procedure should be adopted as a model, since it will make it possible to expedite the compensation of victims, be they private individuals or public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our resolution clearly stipulates that it is absolutely essential, in matters of maritime safety, to break out of this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility, this pernicious system of mutual paralysis wherein States dump responsibility onto the Union, and the Union dumps it on the States, and in the end, the polluters are the only winners. Everyone must play their own part. The Commission, which, for once, has not followed the lead of the Americans even though it might have been beneficial in this case, should establish a basis for maritime safety at the earliest possible opportunity. This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators, and particularly that of the charterer, and to impose heavy penalties. The Commission should ensure the coordination of information. It should not be afraid to confront the lax attitude of some major ports or major shipowners, and should make the issue of flags of convenience a central concern in the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. Let me remind you that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was registered in Valletta. All the same, States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union: the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State (and the resources made available for this).</p>
<p class="contents">We must, and shall, remain particularly vigilant in the months to come in order to ensure that the victims who bear none of the responsibility whatsoever for this disaster receive compensation in full from the polluter, and to ensure that this time we do in fact learn the lessons from the oil slick in terms of maritime safety, so that polluters are deterred once and for all from gambling with the lives of our coastal populations. The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising, however, that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities.

<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood, such as fishermen, particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced.

The fact is that there is no lack of existing measures and appropriate means. The Commission has a whole arsenal of restrictive conditions, measures and decisions (at both international and Community level) already in force in the fisheries and marine environment protection sectors. Effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that people working in maritime sectors are willing to apply Community legislation on condition that it is applied equitably in all the Member States, that it is both acceptable and applicable in technical terms, and has a proper scientific foundation. I find it unacceptable that one of the officials of the European Commission in the Committee on Fisheries should have dared to state in public that the financial resources awarded by the Commission to some scientific bodies should give it the right to have control over their conclusions. This is an extremely serious abuse: obviously the Commission must not assume any right whatsoever to direct the scientists’ conclusions in order to be able to apply the policy it deems suitable, taking only its own interests into account.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards reducing the pressure exerted by fishing upon resources, it is important to emphasise the international nature of this obligation. What real point would there be in reducing our European fishing fleet if, at the same time, third countries were going to continue to deplete fisheries resources? Moreover, it must be observed that the development of the globalisation of trade has the effect of considerably reducing the effectiveness of inspection and supervision of fishing activities. Transhipment has become common practice and frequently fish products from one Member State which cannot be sold within the Union due to exceeding the TAC are sold as imported products or as originating from another Member State. The latter occurs very frequently in businesses whose capital came from a Member State other than the flag State of the fishing vessel (this is actually a way of concealing ‘quota-hopping’).</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety with regard to seafood is also of prime importance. It is essential to safeguard the positive image of seafood products and to prevent unsafe food being sold in the European Union.</p>
