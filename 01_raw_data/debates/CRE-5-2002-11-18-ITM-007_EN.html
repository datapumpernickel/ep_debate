<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as deadlines draw near that are decisive for the future of the CFP – leading to its objectives, terms and conditions being redefined – I feel it is crucial that Parliament firmly reiterates the five principles which served as the main theme of my report and which the Committee on Fisheries wanted to highlight with a view to fully integrating environmental protection requirements into the new common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle is that nothing will be done without the fishermen. Those working in the fisheries sector are the first to be concerned about the protection of the marine environment and the first to be aware of the need to safeguard it. They are also the first victims of any impairment of the environment as shown unfortunately by the latest oil spill, which has today caused despair amongst the fishermen of Galicia. Three years after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, which struck the Vendée region and Brittany, it should not have been possible for the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, an out-dated, dilapidated vessel, to be allowed to sail Community waters. Our report stresses the need to implement swiftly and comprehensively the packages of directives specifically named Erika I and Erika II.</p>
<p class="contents">We refuse to consider fishermen to be predators, to which they are occasionally likened – I might add, wrongly so. On the contrary, this committee grants fishermen the status of wholly legitimate players in environmental protection and stresses that any measures taken without their backing are more than likely to be inappropriate and ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is that we should base decisions regarding the management of fish stocks on scientific knowledge that is as sound and accurate as possible. The economic and social consequences of these decisions are so great that they cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has retained the request to instruct the Commission to draw up a precise action plan with a view to improving the current but very inadequate system of stock evaluation by integrating into it the practical, empirical and pragmatic knowledge of fishermen, as well as checks on landings and by placing the interdisciplinary nature of biological and socio-economic sciences at the very heart of the process of formulating scientific opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle proposes to retain flexible, reversible management instruments such as TACs and quotas, so that the fishing effort can be adjusted to match the state of resources, in preference to rigid instruments that have an irreversible and socially dramatic impact such as the scrapping of vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth principle calls for fishing gear and techniques to be improved with a view to reducing discards, by-catches and the impact on habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, such measures cannot be adopted in a uniform and centralised manner but must leave enough scope for initiatives from professionals working in the sector. Fishermen, their professional organisations and coastal communities must be given a right to experiment. Initiatives in this area must be recognised and encouraged. This is how very promising experiments on the Atlantic coast came about. I shall mention, by way of example, those experiments aiming to adapt fishing vessels and gear so that they may be used to collect marine debris or oil spills or even the creation of artificial reefs to facilitate the development of breeding or rest areas for maritime fauna, or even artificial fertilisation techniques in the open sea for sea bass. My report proposes that such experiments should be eligible for state funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth and final principle states that state aid for fleet modernisation, the aim of which is to improve working conditions, on-board safety, energy savings and the quality of fisheries products, is perfectly compatible with the protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to have been broadly supported by the Committee on Fisheries, which retained all of these positive and constructive proposals, thus rejecting the very negative vision of fishery activities, which strongly permeated the Commission communication. I hope that Parliament, by voting overwhelmingly in favour of this report, will make it clear to all that the protection of the marine environment will be achieved by working with the fishermen rather than against them. That is why, instead of adopting accusatory positions, instead of speaking constantly about an industry in decline and of a makeshift policy, the Committee on Fisheries preferred to send a message of confidence and hope to those working in the industry to consolidate their growing respect for the quality of the marine environment, a quality that is one of the crucial objectives that the new common fisheries policy is bound by duty to pursue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I read with attention the report adopted by the Committee on Fisheries on our action plan on environmental integration. We are happy to note that our views are rather more convergent on this issue of environmental integration than on other reform aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly share the same goals in respect of such important fields of action suggested in the report as environmental protection, improvement of research, including the integration of fishermen's experience, specific measures for specific problems, the implementation of an ecosystem approach, aids to modernisation, industrial fisheries, sustainable aquaculture and so on. In fact the Commission has already started or planned several initiatives to respond to these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to outline some of them. We have requested the ICES to study in 2003 the possibilities for operational procedures to integrate fishermen's experience and knowledge in the assessment and advisory process. We agree that specific situations require specific measures. We do not apply the same combinations of management instruments in the Baltic as in the North Sea or the Mediterranean. We do not intend, either, to set the same targets for different fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve the targets set out in Johannesburg, we are in the process of implementing the bio-diversity action plan with a view to halting bio-diversity decline by 2010 and it is through the reformed CFP that we intend to rebuild stocks sooner than 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently co-financed an FAO expert meeting to develop operational guidelines to implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. In our reform proposals we have excluded the mandatory scrapping of vessels and given more emphasis to multiannual plans using flexible instruments such as TACs, effort regulation and technical measures as main regulatory elements. We have proposed to maintain aid to modernisation of vessels for reasons of security, working conditions and hygiene, provided that there is no increased fishing efficiency in order to prevent increases in fishing pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are promoting the elaboration by the main stakeholders of a European code of responsible fishing practice. The first drafts are already under discussion in the context of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We have requested that the ICES study the ecological consequences of industrial fisheries and the effects on non-fishery activities, as well as the threats, including global warming, to commercial stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has initiated debate to promote a coordinated protection of the marine environment. The recent communication on a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment gives the main elements of the policy advocated for a holistic treatment of the problem. We have addressed the <span class="italic">Erika</span> oil spill by completing most elements of the package, namely the rules on port state control, certification and checking of security measures and bringing forward the phasing out of single hull tankers. The creation of an EU compensation fund for oil spills is expected to be finalised by 2003. We are constantly putting as much pressure as we can on Member States for a better implementation of the habitats directive in the marine environment as completely and as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you have already had the opportunity to study our communication on sustainable aquaculture, you may have noticed how much our intended policy in the area takes into account environmental protection requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as fisheries agreements are concerned, you will soon have an opportunity to confirm that the Commission shares your environmental concerns. The announced communication on partnership agreements will be presented shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, the Commission is on your side regarding the main resolutions of the report. However, I wish to comment on several statements in the explanatory memorandum. Firstly, while I recognise the shortcomings of scientific advice, I strongly disagree that this is the main problem of fisheries management. We all know that the main problem is too many fishermen chasing too few fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rapporteur states that it is the Commission is pursuing a policy of capacity reduction. As I have said before on many occasions, this is simply not correct. It is not correct, either, that the Commission has proposed the abolition of public aid for modernisation of the fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would not agree that industrial fishing has a much greater environmental impact per euro added value than fisheries for human consumption, mainly because I find it odd to measure environmental impact against monetary units, but also because the environmental impact of this kind of fishing has yet to be determined.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I do not agree totally with the form but will support the substance of the report and in particular the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next, I should like clearly to emphasise that reform of the common fisheries policy must be based upon the sustainable development of fisheries. The sustainability in question must be defensible from an environmental point of view and be conceived in both economic and social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the Commission’s proposals for reform, which contain a number of features aimed at sustainability and, therefore, the balance needed if the stock of fish is to be adjusted to the existing number of fishing vessels. We would remind you that it is very important to secure the fishermen’s understanding for, without that and without cooperation with the fishermen, we shall not be able to achieve the necessary results. In that connection, we must respect the fact that fishermen all around the EU attend to their tasks in different ways.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely crucial to the common fisheries policy that decisions be made on the basis of very clear scientific data. The Commission must gather this data from the Member States and, at the same time, have the necessary technical and, especially, human administrative and supervisory resources available to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also very much like to emphasise that the EU must participate more in the development of the international fisheries policy. It is important for our third-country agreements to be given a central place in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we consider the maritime environment – and I am also speaking here in the capacity of shadow rapporteur for Mr Souchet's report, whom I should at any rate like to warmly congratulate on his report and the balanced way in which he has presented it – it appears that, where the implementation of environmental requirements in the fisheries policy is concerned, only a very small proportion is determined by fisheries policy. It struck me that the Commissioner said that if we consider the problem from different angles, then what it comes down to is that there are too few fish and too many fishermen. I wonder if, with regard to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, this situation is so cut and dried, particularly in the light of the recent disaster with an oil tanker off the coast of Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the maritime area covered by European fishermen, then this is only a very small fraction of the total area in the world that is used for fishing. As Mr Busk has already stated, this also means that it is of key importance for us to conclude sound treaties, particularly outside of the European Union, in order to find the right solution. At the same time, the Committee on Fisheries and also my own group, of course, recognise the importance of the fishing environment, especially since the environment, including the maritime environment, is decisive for the fishing industry in terms of what can be caught. This means that if the maritime environment is in a bad state, the fishing industry, in particular, will bear the brunt of this. At the same time, this sector feels under pressure and the difficult bit is to strike the right balance between economic and ecological aspects. It would be nice if the Commission's public statements gave more evidence of this very balance. A properly motivated fisheries sector can contribute quite easily to a better maritime environment, and this also applies to the legislation needed for this. On this score, I am pleased that Mr Souchet – and indeed the Stevenson report, which was formerly the Noriega report – devotes particular attention to aquaculture. There are probably also good opportunities for Europe here, provided that we get the chance on this score to let legislation in this area run parallel with the economy on the one hand and ecology on the other from the word go.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the Souchet report has been particularly well received in our group. We will therefore warmly advise Parliament to vote in favour of the report, assuming that, as the rapporteur has observed, it is essential to take sufficient account of the economic and social aspects of fishing in order to encourage the fisheries industry and environmental legislation. I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on his excellent work because the environment is a fundamental aspect of the CFP, and fishing is the sector most affected by the attacks on the marine environment, as highlighted by the oil slick that is currently threatening the coasts of my region, Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">We know little about the sea and the fragile situation of the resources cannot be explained entirely by over-fishing, as Mr Souchet has rightly said and as the oil slick caused off the coasts of Galicia by the oil tanker <span class="italic">Prestige </span>dramatically demonstrates.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to believe that the fishermen and shellfishermen of my region are not going to face this terrible situation alone, but that Europe is going to show solidarity with them and that the European Commission will fully support them. And I would like to say to the Commission that, since it presented these proposals in May, it has received sufficient messages from this Parliament, from the Council and from the sector to redirect this reform in a different way, bearing in mind that it will always have to be gradual, be provided with sufficient resources and be agreed with the sector, with the Member States and with this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission is hearing this message. It is a shame that in May, on presenting its proposals for the reform of the CFP, the Commission should have ignored the resolution approved by this Parliament in January on the Green Paper, in which this House urged it to present a proposal for reform to create a sustainable and more Community-focused CFP, in opposition to attempts at renationalisation; a CFP that is fairer, eliminating the discrimination against certain fleets, showing more solidarity and supporting regions dependent on fishing, basically by means of Community co-funding of the restructuring of the fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important not only to draft these reports, but also to consider aquaculture and safe conditions within the fishing industry. It is unfortunate that the report was late, although this was followed by very fast work. Truly impressive. Further to the votes in the committee meetings, there are now sound reports before us. Despite this, we should, in addition to the precautionary measures that need to be observed, also consider the situations we are facing. ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, is keen to reduce the catch quota of flatfish even further, while the safe margin is in sight. This cannot be completely justified. We should, however, ensure that we do justice to historical catch rights in the new common fisheries policy; these should not be jeopardised. Moreover, we should think very carefully about access to the seas. I am, of course, thinking of the North Sea, but the point I am trying to make is that fishing unquoted species is dangerous, because quoted species are caught along with these. It is at present extremely difficult to check whether the quoted species are left alone. Should they be thrown overboard or taken somewhere? It has in any event a huge impact on those keeping track of the quotas and is important for the valuable species. In my view, this additional burden on the stocks is unacceptable, certainly if quotas were to dwindle even further. People have already taken the pressure off on their own initiatives. It will therefore be very difficult to sell this. Policy and management are dependent on the support base within the sector. In my view, we should prevent the sector from straying too far, and we will also need to involve it in creating and thinking of new solutions. This is why it is also extremely important for control and sanctions to be harmonised at international level. As for international fishing, I condemn unilateral measures, for they do not have a positive bearing on sustainable fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is: thank you, rapporteurs who have written the reports. I think that we have a sound basis to vote on this report in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Topical events, such as the accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, make what I want to say about the report by Mr Souchet much more relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report taken on by Mr Stevenson, I believe it has been the victim of various procedural problems. This report should have represented the reference framework for Parliament’s position on the reform of the fisheries policy, and it is surprising, and only attributable to procedural problems, that this report differs in many respects from what we have subsequently done on approving the legislative proposals in the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the problems stem from a Commission proposal which arrived late, which has turned out to be perhaps a little immature, and which furthermore was incomplete at the outset. For example, the main package has been presented while lacking certain important sections, such as fishing in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, there are very clear indications that the Commission’s proposals, in structural terms, lack a reasonable basis and at times verge on the absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the policy on the conservation of resources, I will resist anticipating a later debate, which we are going to hold. However, I would like to express a certain distaste at the way we have dealt with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">For some time, the fishing policy has established a division between States, and the Commission’s proposal has been accompanied by a scenario which has accentuated that separation between States. Perhaps certain Ministers have taken part in this game, but that is not the important thing. What is really important is that the situation of the populations of cod, hake and other species has blurred the distinction between what have been known as the ‘friends of fishing’ and the ‘friends of the fish’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, however many debates we have held and however many issues may legitimately divide us, it is clear that we must resolve the problem of how to guarantee sustainable fishing. To this end, I believe it is necessary to deal with fundamental issues, transcending what I would call very specific and overly national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We could perhaps have left behind the rigid positions which have divided us – the distribution of quotas for example – and we could have reformed the Community policy, protecting sections of the fleet which most of the economy of the regions dependent on fishing rely on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must adopt it now precisely because, in accordance with their Accession Agreements of 1986, the transitional period established for the Spanish State and for Portugal are about to expire. From now on, therefore, these States must have the same rights in Community waters as the nine Member States that established the common fisheries policy at the start of the 1980s.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these obvious statements, Madam President, a majority in the Committee on Fisheries refused, in a totally unacceptable decision, to grant the Spanish and the Portuguese equal rights. The new CFP ought to acknowledge that the fleets of the fifteen Member States all have the same rights, thereby putting an end to the privileges and discriminations between the citizens, fleets and countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This pro-European – and I must say also Galician – position that my country has adopted inspired the report that I had the honour of drafting on the policies to be implemented for the reform of the CFP. Nor did we reject temporary restrictions based solely on the need to conserve fish stocks being established or maintained in this equal treatment of access to Community waters. We argued for the need to review or, where necessary, replace the principle of relative stability with a principle that is fairer and more consistent with the Treaties in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">We argued for international fisheries policy and also joint ventures to be strengthened, and for public aid from the European Union for investment intended to improve conditions on board ships, which are currently very poor, to be maintained. For these and other reasons rejected by a majority in the committee, I cannot accept the report that now bears the name of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. The report nevertheless upholds some principles with which I agree, which survived the destructive offensive against the amendments tabled and adopted by the majority. This means that dialogue and a new compromise on the part of everyone where the reform of the CFP is concerned are still possible. In any event, they are still necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is true that a more balanced approach is needed. The current COM on fisheries policy has not been a success. It has not done any favours – and in some cases has been discriminatory – to Irish fishermen. The opportunity must not be missed to redress the current imbalance during this reform process. That is what Irish fishermen are asking for at the moment, and that is what I am asking for.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues which is currently being discussed relates to the issue of access to the Irish Box. The Spanish Government, for example, is claiming that it is entitled from next January to even greater access to the Irish fishing waters. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. It would have absolutely disastrous consequences for Irish fishermen, their families and Irish fishing communities. Fish stocks in the Irish Sea at the present time are at a precariously low level. Opening up our waters to more Spanish vessels than is presently allowed will only result in a decimation of our stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Sea is a biologically very sensitive area. It is the spawning ground for many of our fish species. Only last week Parliament's Committee on Fisheries passed an amendment stating clearly that fish balances shall not be disturbed in western waters and therefore it is in this context that relative stability must be understood.</p>
<p class="contents">We must protect fishing regions where our fish stocks are under threat and the Irish Box and the Irish Sea is one such region. The last thing we want is to have our waters opened up to more effort by Spanish fishermen, or indeed any other fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to protect our fish stocks and not decimate them. Any new conservation measures which are introduced at European Union level must be brought about in consultation with all interested parties involved in all Member States in order to protect what is a very valuable natural resource for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The head of the British delegation, Sir Con O'Neil, remarked that these two events were not unconnected. Prior to that there had hardly been any interest in a Community fisheries policy because the founding six had virtually no fishing resources. Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway all had rich coastal fisheries and they had been kept in good condition by effective conservation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">O'Neil attests to this; experts from the British Ministry of Agriculture produced a report showing that British waters were literally teeming with fish, whilst there were very few within the fishing limits of the present Community countries. The main evidence for this is that Community waters did not attract foreign fishermen, while British waters most certainly did. After 30 years of the CFP, Britain's waters no longer teem with fish. To paraphrase Sir Con: 'These two events are not unconnected'. Yet still members of the Committee on Fisheries seem unable to make the connection. They call for more technical and human resources. They want more money for research. They want management plants, sustainable development, integrated policies, multiannual plans, the application of the precautionary principle and, wait for it, target reference points for biomass and fishing mortality. If jargon were the solution, Member State waters would still be teeming with fish, the CFP would be a world-beater. But all that jargon does is to hide an uncomfortable truth: the common fisheries policy has not worked, does not work and cannot work no matter how much reform is dressed up in flowery words. As long as fish are considered to be a common European resource, there will be no sense of ownership or responsibility. Predatory fishing becomes the norm. It is an inevitable consequence of the policy and leads to the depletion of stocks. Reform is not the solution. The CFP cannot be reformed. It has proved to be incapable of reform. It should be scrapped and fisheries should be managed once again by national governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I remember that, while I was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the tragic accident involving the <span class="italic">Erika </span>took place, and our committee put an oral question and adopted a resolution. At that point we were all united, and I hope we are in this case as well. I would like to stress – and you know this – that Galicia is the region most dependent on fishing in the whole of Europe and is extraordinarily rich in seafood and fish, which, following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, is going to take many years to recover, above all in the areas most directly affected by the oil slick.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to prepare a motion for a resolution and I believe that the political groups must be united, so that this House can issue a political opinion, so that events of this type never happen again. I believe that we have a very important political responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is terrible to see fishing resources covered in petrol, dead sea birds and the fishermen who live exclusively from the sea. Sometimes over-fishing is discussed but these issues are not. I believe it is very important to bear it in mind and I hope, as I have said, that all our colleagues will show solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reports before the plenary, there has been no mention of the Busk report, and I would like to congratulate him, because there is no need for either a debate or for amendments since we have all agreed on the issue of illegal fishing and also the fight against it; it is therefore important to point it out.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the report by Mr Souchet has worked out well. It is a reasonable and positive report, and there are no amendments to it in this House either.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report by Mr Stevenson, everybody knows what happened and I am not going to go into details; today we are dealing with the report which carries the name of the chairman of our committee. I would simply say to you that my political group has presented certain minimal amendments; we have tried to clear up certain issues. I would like to say, and I say this in general, that we are dealing with a communication. In other words, we are not dealing with a legislative document, but the report by Mr Jové will be, and we will examine that report during the next part-session. I hope that we can focus all our efforts and use the balanced approach indicated here, in order to adopt the commitments in this report, which will have to be debated, as I have said, at the next part-session in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments we have presented, we have tried to remove the word ‘permanent’ from the twelve miles, because the Legal Services of the Council and the European Parliament, as well as the Commission, accept that, since it is a derogation from the Treaty, it cannot be permanent, because that would amount to a modification of the Treaty itself. Therefore, it is simply a measure that requires a time limit. Since we are not in agreement on whether it is five, ten, fifteen or twenty years, we have simply asked that we may adopt an agreement on this during the debate on the Jové report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of the arguments are reasonable and justified, whereas others are hasty and disproportionate. The reform of the common fisheries policy is necessary, and no sensible person would deny this.</p>
<p class="contents">The depletion of fish stocks is not a fantasy or an exaggeration by ecologists, by those seeking to protect marine life or by pessimistic scientists. It is a tragic reality for many species. In the past, we also saw the collapse of some population units, but it was then possible to rebuild them by shifting the fishing effort to other species and to other latitudes. Today, this is all but impossible. The example of the collapse of the Newfoundland cod banks, the source of so much history and so much legend in Portugal, my own country, should serve as a warning to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the more than 35 000 species that populate the seas, only one hundred are of commercial and consumer interest. This is a fact! Today, however, we are seeing an impoverishment of biological diversity in the marine environment and the gradual destruction of habitats and ecosystems. The situation has reached this disturbing point not only as a result of the pressure exerted by fishing; but other well known reasons have also contributed to this phenomenon. Fishing is now subject to a dual requirement: the ecological requirement to preserve fish stocks and the political and social requirement to maintain the economic activities of the maritime fishing sector. These activities must, therefore, pay close attention to the state of stocks and not be undertaken in a predatory way or in the form of simple hunting and gathering, as if we were still living in the Stone Age.</p>
<p class="contents">Linking the Souchet report on the Community Action Plan to integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy with the Stevenson report on the reform of the CFP and the Busk report on monitoring and eradicating illegal fishing was, consequently, an inspired move. The reform of the common fisheries policy must necessarily be a compromise that balances all strands: the social, the economic, the cultural and the ecological. Those Members who are most in favour – as they claim – of fishing, should therefore be mindful of the de la Palissian truism: without fish, there can be no fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the Stevenson report, although it is somewhat contradictory, it does take account of many of the proposals and positions that we called for and which are important to Portugal, specifically the installation of 12-mile coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP, the participation of fishermen’s organisations in the decision-making process, socio-economic measures to compensate for the effects of the reform, which must take account of past efforts, greater investment in research and ensuring that there is no legal vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of our proposals that we felt were of the utmost importance were also accepted: the extension of the derogation concerning free access to 50 miles in the case of the most remote regions, as laid down in the Treaty, and strengthening the support mechanisms for the processing industry, specifically the canning industry. Nevertheless, we disagree with the proposals that are intended to change the report, with some that were rejected in the Committee on Fisheries and which run counter to the positions and proposals that we tabled once again being adopted. We shall, however, be voting in favour of the proposal which is comparable to an amendment of ours, which is of enormous importance to Portugal, and which has already been adopted in the other report, stating that the six-twelve mile zones should be maintained and defined as a feature of the common fisheries policy, for an unlimited period of time, in order to promote conservation and to encourage the local development of small-scale fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures and proposals presented should have come about a very long time ago. That is why they are now absolutely necessary. The only thing we are doubtful about and see problems with is the Commission’s proposal concerning the possibility of reducing the fishing fleets by means of the simple ‘one boat in, one boat out’ proposal. I do not really understand how that could work and how it could possibly lead to our obtaining a smaller fishing fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also understand the Commission’s frustration in view of the difficulties in getting the Council and the Member States to accept their responsibility. For so many years, ministers and the Council have failed to see the connection between fisheries policy and a reduced access to fish. They have taken no responsibility at all for sustainable development and for ensuring that fish stocks are preserved, this being the only possible way of rescuing the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, for example, the Irish Sea is concerned, a quota 28% higher than what researchers have considered to be acceptable has been permitted over the last ten years. In this context, it does not matter whether the fishing fleets come from Ireland or Spain or some other country.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to say that we now face our hour of destiny when it comes to fish stocks. The Council has not wished to decide about restrictions on catch quotas, which have not been at all realistic. There have been no adequate supervisory programmes, and there has been no desire to place limits upon fishing fleets. We already know that this is the cause of the whole problem. What shall we do, therefore? I think we must be able to adopt the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden plans to introduce a unilateral moratorium on cod fishing in the Baltic. That is in actual fact a demand made by the Greens/ALE Group in connection with the formation of a government. Cod is threatened, not only in the Baltic but also in the Kattegat and throughout the North Sea. The International Marine Research Council believes that the EU’s reconstruction plan is entirely inadequate and that the situation is urgent. We must therefore adopt measures as drastic as introducing a moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">I now hope that the Commission will support this proposal. I also assume that the Commission will, as soon as possible, respond positively to the possibility of using the structural funds for compensation, for that is completely in line with the Commission’s own proposal about the possibility of acting responsibly to safeguard and preserve fish stocks in the future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that it calls for the system of access to waters and resources to be maintained as well as the fundamental principle of relative stability. I regret, however, that the original proposal by Mr Nogueira Román, who wanted to re-focus attention on the economic and social dimension of the common fisheries policy and, therefore, study it at the same time as the issue of fishing effort, has not been retained.</p>
<p class="contents">What struck me is that the proposal by the European Commission on the roadmap on reform of the common agricultural policy reflects the lack of priority that the latter gives to the social impact of its plan since this impact only features in seventh place in the list of proposed measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Commission communication of 6 November on the measures intended to soften the impact of the reform, it confirms the plan to do away with 28 000 jobs over three years, between 2003 and 2006, due to the mass scrapping of vessels as predicted by the Commission. We are naturally waiting for an appropriate time to question the Commission on these dramatic figures, Madam President, which will be when we study this communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The whole scenario is depressing enough already: here we are, sitting in a warm room and endlessly talking, not only with each other but often, alas, at odds with each other. Out there, though, our environmental accidents and overfishing are making conditions catastrophic for more and more fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">In here, or so it seems, we prefer to stonewall rather than work on a genuine reform, and the image of the European Union suffers. We should start by sorting out our own environment, and do it at once. The Commission proposals may have been late in landing on the table, but they got there well before the summer. Now that the first snows are falling, we are talking; but it is only today that we are discussing the timetable for the reform, which is due to enter into force on 1 January of next year, which is only a few weeks away.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the Gallic bias of its content, this timetable started out as a tall order in linguistic terms. By dint of great efforts and 258 amendments, the Committee on Fisheries was then able to make the timetable readable with a view to genuine reform. It is curious, though, to take one example, that the committee voted to safeguard the twelve nautical mile zone – and now I am supposed to vote against it on Wednesday! That I will not do. Am I a puppet; are we marionettes? Granted, we all want to be re-elected. Is that why the spirits invoked by the Committee on Fisheries have proved so remarkably changeable? We all know that without fish, the fishing industry will die out. What this is about is protecting the fleet and protection of resources, which are fundamental principles; there can be no deviation from them and no softening-up of them. I want the fisheries industry to be economically successful, socially balanced, and to make sense in environmental terms. We have to face reality and cannot set sail in an ever-increasing fleet in search of the mirage of stocks that last for ever.</p>

My region was affected by the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> and <span class="italic">Erika</span> disasters; their region has been struck by the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, but the ship’s name does nothing to ease the problems of those living in the region and of the Galician fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the conception of the new fisheries policy is problematic but the fledgling policy is due to come into force on the evening of 31 December. I think that the Committee on Fisheries has worked hard to restore a balance between the exploitation of fishery resources and the protection of these resources for future generations, without forgetting the economy of coastal regions. In any case, we are seeking a better balance between these two areas than that put forward in your proposals, one that corresponds to sustainable development in the correct sense of the word. This applies, of course, to fish stocks, where this balance is needed, but it also concerns coastal economies. And we tried to draw your attention, in these three reports and in others, to the implications of the political decisions regarding employment in regions that are dependent on fishing, to the consequences of scrapping boats, since of course, if we scrap them and fish levels increase in the future, there may not be any fishermen left to fish them. We must keep our heads. We must also ensure that our fishermen do not use boats that are too old, which they make last longer and that they overload with equipment, thus running all kinds of risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee, in all its debates and through its rapporteurs, is seeking to influence the final decisions of the Commission and the Council. Of course, there are good decisions and we should highlight them, such as controls and sanctions, involving the relevant parties in the decision-making processes, improving knowledge of fishing techniques and resources. In short, if all this is done, if the balance is maintained, our fishermen will be able to continue to have faith in their work, in their business and we in our regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is essential that the Commission gets it right, proposing a management system which ensures sustainable fisheries backed up by up-to-date independent and verifiable scientific evidence involving stakeholders and installing confidence in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the first set of CFP reform proposals nears a conclusion, I find myself more cynical about the process and less optimistic about the future for Scotland's fishing-dependent communities than ever before. Why should this be so? Is a workable EU fisheries policy achievable? I have always believed that the only way to succeed in achieving the necessary balance between resource, harvesting and conservation and to better encourage compliance with any management regime is to have a regime with which the stakeholders can have some faith. That is why I have welcomed the Commission's support for regional advisory councils as a step in the right direction, towards a much-needed new and better way of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions, however, have to accompany words and I have been shocked by the attitude displayed by the Commission recently in relation to cod and other white fish quotas for next year. To announce the possible closure of the Scots fishing industry with the 'we know best' and 'it's all your own fault' statements attributed to Commissioner Fischler seems to fly in the face of the stated intention to involve stakeholders more. This 'tough guy' approach, presumably designed to make the actual outcome for next year seem relatively palatable, should have no place in a new CFP. The sad truth is that irreparable damage has been done by the Commission in the last six months to the Scottish confidence in Europe being capable of managing fisheries at all.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mr Fischler's about-turn on deep-water management, followed by the insensitive presentation of the ICES's advice on cod and its repercussions for Scotland, it is little wonder that conspiracy theories abound. Does Commissioner Fischler want to be remembered as the architect of a new and successful EU fisheries policy? Or the one who brought desolation to communities and destruction to a way of life? Sadly at this moment, he seems to me more likely to achieve the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">I and the leadership of the Scottish fishing industry have played a constructive role, working with environmental organisations in the consultative process towards CFP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the Commission and the Council taking due account of that and giving some return and not penalising the Scots for their efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to its positive points, I would highlight three main aspects:</p>
<p class="contents">- the first is that sustainable fisheries management must be based on a balanced range of measures, not only on the simplistic solution of fleet reduction, but also on a greater selection of fishing methods, on the proper use of the MAGPs and of the TACs and quotas. Most of all, the recommendation that in any reduction of the fishing effort, lower targets are set for Member States that have already undertaken fleet reduction;</p>
<p class="contents">- the second aspect is the clear recommendation that fisheries agreements with third countries, which, if properly implemented are of mutual convenience for both parties, must continue to be an integral part of the CFP. For this reason, it is right that ships removed from the Community fleet can continue to be included in fleets belonging to joint ventures;</p>
<p class="contents">- the third aspect is the desire to find a specific solution to the problem of access to the waters of the outermost regions, which have very delicate balances and ecosystems, such as the Azores, the Island of Madeira and other regions in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect that I feel is most negative is the report’s total omission of the structural component. There are two main reasons for not changing the rules laid down at the Berlin European Council on the funding of fisheries structures. The first is that fleet modernisation is in itself a priority matter, because otherwise the Community fleet will become uncompetitive: where Portugal is concerned, 40% of our fleet is over 25 years old and therefore, unless it receives support, it will be unviable. The second reason is that since appropriations were set in Berlin for fleet modernisation by 2007 and since various ship owners have placed orders on this basis, it is politically unacceptable to now change the rules in mid-stream. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These have to do not only with how we assess the situation, which is at present, indeed, not exactly rosy, but also with what measures are to be taken. We even take different views of the scientific investigations into our resources, as shown by the report on our timetable, which we are discussing this evening, and I imagine that discussions in the Council of Ministers are just as animated as our own in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europe's Parliament, though, we should be concentrating on the points of fact and attempting to play an active part in fashioning a reform whose prime objective will be to maintain fishery resources. We are talking about the precautionary principle, and cuts, painful though they may be, are probably necessary to secure sustainable management of fish stocks and hence the long-term survival of fishery as a whole. The social component of the measures we are to decide on, however, plays a key role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on all Members of this House, as well as the Fisheries Ministers, to fulfil their responsibility for fishery as a whole in the European Union and to distance themselves from myopic national interests when deciding what shape the reform is to take. We should not now let the great opportunity pass to decide on a fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. We have to make use of this opportunity, or else the prospects for our fisheries in Europe will, in the foreseeable future, be bleak indeed. That this is so is already demonstrated very clearly by the current state of cod stocks in the North Sea, and I hope that will be a lesson to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we could agree on those two questions, we would have an amicable solution to all the other questions that arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with those who say that the common fisheries policy is responsible for the present state of stocks. The reason the stocks are in their present state is because the scientists were not heeded. When the Commission took the scientists' message to the Council of Ministers it was not heeded and its advice was not put into effect. I do not agree with the present policy, but within its framework stocks could have been conserved if the advice of the Commission had been taken through the years.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem with the common fisheries policy is that on the one hand the Commission has the responsibility but can merely give advice. The Council of Ministers and the individual states are the people with the ultimate responsibility. There is a lot of evidence that in the past they did not discharge their responsibility, without fear or favour, in a manner which ensured that every fisherman took what he was entitled to take and every ship got its quota and no more.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy goes too far. There was never any need to take fish into common ownership. It does not make sense. We have a common agricultural policy. It does not give me the right or an Irish farmer the right to pick grapes or olives in the south of Spain. It does not give us the right to harvest forests in Finland or Sweden. Neither should the common fisheries policy include the common ownership of stocks. It makes no sense. As far as I know, nevertheless, there is only one country which loses out and gets less than its natural share. You will not find a more convinced European integrationist than I am, so I can say that there is one region in the Union, the west of Ireland, that does not get its natural share. I have no special quarrel with the Spanish, French or British fishermen who come into what are natural waters. However, in other areas – oil and minerals – and in every form of jurisdiction Member States have over their oceans, natural resources fall within the remit of the national governments. That should also apply to fish. It would make a lot more sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not maintained the fishing stocks or fishermen's jobs. Discarding nearly two million tonnes of healthy fish each year is absolutely ridiculous. Fish do not swim separately in the sea. They swim together and the sooner we work that out the better.</p>
<p class="contents">The 6- and 12-mile limits must be confirmed permanently. I am not convinced by the argument that we cannot do it and I shall be voting firmly for the fact that these limits should be etched in stone. Not only must those 6- and 12-mile limits be there, but they must be managed at a local level and properly devolved from Brussels, not just some token gesture. If local fishermen have proper ownership of these waters, the conservation measures will work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the North Sea cod is disappearing. Is it a coincidence that the cod are disappearing in the areas where the industrial fishing takes place? We take out millions of tonnes of sand eels and scour the sea beds, and the cod eat sand eels. It is not a coincidence. We must do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Norway and Iceland have good fishing stocks and they are not part of the common fisheries policy. Again, is this a coincidence? I would agree here with Mr McCartin. Do we need to make fishing resources part of the common fisheries policy? I will say this quite bluntly: if the Commission cannot run the common fisheries policy properly, then send it back to the Member States and let them do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Souchet and Mr Busk on the quality of their reports; and with regard to the report which in the end the chairman of the committee has taken charge of, I will comment on recital K and Amendment No 23.</p>
<p class="contents">The area reserved for traditional fishing within a band of 6 miles – which was subsequently increased to 12 and extended to all Member States – was extended, for the last time, within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy of 1992, for a period of ten years. We have therefore been in a provisional situation for thirty years. It appears that the aim was to allow for a progressive adaptation of the small-scale coastal fleet. And if they have not carried it out, I do not know when they are going to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal on the timetable for the reform of the common fisheries policy advocates permanently maintaining the prohibition of fishing within 12 miles – a proposal, by the way, whose legal validity has been called into question. I believe that, at a time when we are facing enlargement and we have a Convention under way, paradoxically, this proposal would mark the beginning of a period of renationalisation of Community waters contrary to the principle of equal access for fishing vessels to all European Union stocks, which would also involve the additional risk of a possible future increase of this restricted area if it is adopted as a permanent exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the Europeans in general and the people who live from the sea, in particular, will not understand why the waters are not communitarised, why we have this restriction – an exception to the principle of free access – why this sector is not being communitarised while the others are. Therefore, from a strictly legal point of view, the establishment of a permanent exception should be ruled out forever.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to encourage Members to vote against Recital K and Amendment No 23, which, in my humble opinion, are contrary to Community law and European common sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It took me 16 hours to travel here to Strasbourg today. Two weeks ago I went to Hobart in Tasmania in less time than it takes to get to Strasbourg. When I find out that part of the reason for the delay is reindeer running on the runway of the international airport in Strasbourg, I find that utterly incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I understand that during the debate a great deal of concern has been expressed about the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> off the coast of Galicia. I hope that from what has been said in this debate my colleagues will agree with me that we should be calling for the Commission and the EU institutions to take all possible steps to aid Galicia in dealing with this horrendous problem. The newspapers in Scotland today were calling it the ‘Costa del muerte’ and saying that 3 000 tonnes of oil had already been spilled. I understand that the tanker contained 70 000 tonnes of oil and the idea of a spillage on that scale is absolutely horrifying.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here with a debate in which you have heard Mr Parish expressing a great deal of anger. You have heard Mr Hudghton also expressing anger from a Scottish perspective. Part of this debate deals with the Commission's roadmap. I should say at the outset that the recent scientific advice from ICES, which recommends the complete closure of the whitefish sector in the UK and Ireland, points to the fact that to have a roadmap is superfluous. As far as the common fisheries policy is concerned we are on the road to nowhere. What is the use of debating future fisheries policy in this Chamber tonight if for British and Irish fishermen there is no future? What is the point of discussing multi-annual management plans if tax and quotas in the North Sea, the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea and the Kattegat are to be set at zero for at least the next five years? What an indictment of the common fisheries policy! What a sorry state of affairs that after 20 years of failed policies we are now looking at the destruction of an industry that is as old as mankind itself. In the name of conservation our fishermen have been forced to dump millions of tonnes of prime fish back into the sea dead to comply with the lunatic quota scheme. In the name of conservation our fishermen have suffered tie-ups, lay-offs, emergency closures, decommissioning, job losses and plunging incomes and now the message from the scientists appears to be that everything they have advised in the past has failed – all the technical conservation measures, all the increased mesh sizes, the square mesh panels to allow young cod to escape, all the emergency closures of cod spawning grounds, the 40 000 square miles of the North Sea closed for 12 weeks last year without one penny of compensation paid to the fishermen, the three years in a row that the Irish Sea has been closed for cod fishing, the massive decommissioning round that took over 100 demersal vessels out of the Scottish fleet alone. All of these measures recommended by the scientists and ordered by the Commission have apparently failed. It beggars belief.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no place in the common fisheries policy for our roadmap if 20 000 fishermen, fish processors and harbour workers are facing the closure of their industry and the loss of their jobs. There is no justification for closing the whole whitefish sector. Seven hundred thousand tonnes of cod were caught in the Northeast Atlantic last year. That does not sound like a species on the verge of collapse. Tens of thousands of big mature cod are being caught around the Faroes and Iceland where they have no CFP. If the cod have migrated northwards due to global warming, pollution or the North Atlantic drift, then no amount of draconian measures will make them return. It is true the cod have gone from the central part of the North Sea. Nobody is disputing that. But their place has been taken by prawns, now one of the biggest fisheries around the British Isles. We know that cod is a key predator of prawns so it is not surprising that when the cod decline the prawns thrive. But it is also a fact that prawns feed on cod larvae, so once the cod have gone they may never return. That has certainly been the case in Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept that the possible recovery of cod stocks is in any way an adequate justification for the sacrifice of the prawn, haddock, whiting, plaice, and flatfish fisheries. Nor do I accept that there are anything like sufficient funds in the budget to even meet a fraction of the likely socio-economic impact costs which this catastrophic proposal implies. So there is no point in discussing a roadmap tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was given three explanations over a period of time: one was that there were goats on the runway; another, that there were deer on it; and we were told on one occasion that it was occupied by reindeer. We were also told that there was fog, so it was obviously difficult to identify the animals involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to repeat what my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne has already told you about the report that has been under discussion. He has enlarged upon what had to be done in consequence of the great and pestilential amount of oil to which, unfortunately, Galicia has fallen victim. It is no doubt evident to all that this is a challenge to Europe. You will be aware that a plan exists, one that the Commission submitted some considerable time ago in connection with the ‘<span class="italic">Erika</span>’ disaster, and which also includes an approach to implementation to which my fellow-Commissioner Mrs de Palacio is giving her very close attention. There is also, associated with this approach, a certain plan for compensation, which is to be put into action in the year ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first, though, state my position on the report by Mr Stevenson, to whom I would like to start by expressing my thanks for its drafting. I would also like to thank the Committee on Fisheries, which has made really great efforts to keep to the tight timetable and enable us to decide on the reform of the common fisheries policy by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament and the Commission are largely agreed on the fundamental objectives that we have in mind in the fisheries reform, and I am glad that they support the fundamental objectives of the reform. Whilst it is about sustainability, it is also about the sector's competitiveness. It has to do with decent living conditions for all who work in the fishery industry, and in just the same way it involves linking in environmental concerns and, as a primary concern, new ways of managing fishery resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that you support this fundamental approach, even though we no doubt have different views concerning the means we choose to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to a number of specific points. You quite rightly call for better information concerning the state of stocks, and more investment in scientific research into stock development. The Commission has at present a total of EUR 35 million at its disposal for the purposes of research into the fisheries sector. It is with regret that I have to tell you that these resources will be reduced somewhat over the coming years, but, in the context of fisheries research as a whole, we are prepared to inject more funds for the specific purpose of researching the state of stocks and the way they are developing.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, we also want to do more research with alternative technical measures, such as the development of new fishing gear, in mind. But let us be honest: research can be based only on accurate data that has been carefully collected. Not the least significant factor underlying our present dilemma with regard to cod is what we have been told by scientists – scientists appointed not by the Commission, but by the Member States. In these matters, the Commission has only the status of an observer. The scientists tell us, though, that in the past, reports of landings and on the composition of catches were sometimes quite simply not accurate, and that misreporting had therefore led to the wrong conclusions being drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to level accusations at anyone right now, but we must at least acknowledge that this is a problem we also have to solve if we want to come to better conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Your resolutions on the subject of stock maintenance and fishery management coincide with our approach. Fishery management needs frameworks that are tailor-made for it and that will last for years. These frameworks have to be adapted to the fisheries, operations and stocks in each case and we have to adhere to the precautionary principle. These frameworks also have to ensure that the minimum of fish are discarded.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Stevenson, things are not so straightforward that we can only blame the imposition of quotas for the number of fish that are discarded. There are other countries in the world, which have other approaches, impose no quotas and have a problem with discarded fish all the same.</p>
<p class="contents">That fish are continuing to be discarded in such a way has to do with all the essential components of fishery.</p>
<p class="contents">It certainly has a technical dimension in that fishing gear is not selective enough. It is certainly a problem that, in mixed fishing, the quota for some stocks is reached faster than that for others, even leading to stocks being discarded when we do not want that at all. There is, of course, exactly the same problem with limitation of the fishing effort. If we do not achieve a certain balance of these essential, key elements of managing fishery at all, then we will never get anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">You devote part of your report to the Mediterranean, and demonstrate thoroughness in doing so. Here I am in full agreement with you that the Mediterranean has to be handled differently; that is what tailor-made approaches are all about. The methods that work in the North Sea cannot be applied here: the fishery carried on in the Mediterranean, most of which is artisan in nature, makes the Mediterranean different. It is different because of the narrowness of the continental shelf that is found there. It is different because of the far greater involvement of third states in fishing it. It therefore demands a specific approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have put forward. We also want to cooperate more with the third states that are active in the Mediterranean. This means that we want to be very careful in preparing for enhanced cooperation, and plan to organise, in the second half of next year, a conference under the Italian Presidency, to which we will invite all the states bordering on the Mediterranean, and at which we will be putting forward ideas for joint management and, above all, for improving research.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of fleet management, let me just reiterate that it is simply not the case that fishermen are obliged to break up their boats. Nobody has been able to produce evidence of it, and nowhere in our drafts is there the requirement that they should do so; all scrapping will be on a voluntary basis. What we do want is that fishermen who actually want to do that should get better support from us than they have had in the past. The decision, though, as to whether or not to scrap a vessel, is one that every fisherman will have to take for himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to waters and resources involves two issues. I regard access to resources and waters in the outermost regions as a special case, which must therefore be dealt with accordingly. We will investigate the situation in these regions, and will be making appropriate proposals before the end of the coming year. The special restrictions on access to these regions are to remain in force until then.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of access to the North Sea is primarily a legal question, as is that of whether the twelve-nautical-mile zone should be set up on a permanent basis or only for a limited period of time. I would warn against simply saying that there will be a vote on it. An arrangement without limit of time is what is needed. The European Court of Justice will then rule on what is lawful. I believe that we should rely primarily on the Treaty and that it, as in the past, should be the basis for any decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the relevant provisions of Spain's and Portugal's accession treaties are due to expire, which will initially mean only that these states will also have access to northern waters. I am very well aware that it is the discarding issue that rears its head here. Specifically, the problem has to do with the fact that other species subject to a quota are also caught along with species subject neither to a TAC nor to a quota, so that there is the risk of fish being caught and being thrown back into the sea, despite being in themselves very valuable. We will have to do some in-depth work on this issue, and are ready to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the question of monitoring and the implementation of fisheries legislation. I believe that it remains a matter of importance that I re-emphasise that we absolutely need the sector to be involved, which means that the new advisory councils are actually the basis of our future improved cooperation with the sector. It stands to reason that there is no doubt that we will see to it that the agreed sanctions, controls and inspections are actually implemented throughout the EU and in the same manner.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other issues that I might discuss, but I want to address only one of them – fisheries in the waters of third countries, in regard to which we are working on a communication on fisheries partnerships with third countries, which we will be adopting at the beginning of December. In this communication, you will find much of what you have called for, examples including adherence to the precautionary principle, the justified demands of developing countries for the development of their own fisheries sector, more efficient supervision, and so on. This, I believe, is where we have to go down a new road. There must be no doubt about the fact that we will have to keep on fighting for this mischief with flags of convenience to stop, and, above all, for illegal fishing to be curbed.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse what you have to say on aquaculture, and I therefore want to express my gratitude for it. One point – the social issue – remains to be cleared up. If you look at how much public money has been spent to date on social measures, and how much we intend to spend on social measures in future, it will become clear that this reform very definitely has a social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
