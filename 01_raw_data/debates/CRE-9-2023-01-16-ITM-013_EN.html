<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. – </span></span>  Dear colleagues, can I ask you to take a seat in order for us to watch a video as we start the ceremony of the 30th anniversary of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(A video was shown in the Chamber)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I welcome to the Plenary the Swedish Minister for European Affairs, Jessika Roswall, Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee Chair, Anna Cavazzini, dear Members and colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 1992, when addressing the European Parliament, then Commission President Jacques Delors called the creation of the single market the beginning of a new era. And so it was. The single market has been a cornerstone of European integration, which united Europe at a time when the weight of walls and iron curtains felt so heavy. We tore down internal barriers and replaced them with common values, creating a place where goods, persons, services and capital could freely move around. It was not just an act of symbolic unity. It was about something far greater than that. It was about freedom, about prosperity and, above all, opportunity. Opportunity for all citizens to be able to live, work, study and travel anywhere within our union, knowing that their fundamental rights and freedoms will be protected throughout. Opportunity for businesses – large and small – to establish themselves wherever they choose, giving them greater market access while fostering competitiveness. Opportunity for consumers to have wider choices at cheaper prices and with stronger consumer protection that will account for their interests. And perhaps the one most often overlooked: the opportunity for our collective interest. </p>
<p class="contents">Being the world’s largest single democratic market has strengthened our place in the world, and here Europe has far more leverage than we sometimes give ourselves credit for. The single market is one of our union’s greatest achievements; truth be told, it has become indispensable to us all. Today, our single market accounts for 56 million European jobs. It has raised the European Union’s GDP between 8 and 9% on average, and it has even accounted for over 1 million babies born to Erasmus couples over the past 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, with war having returned to our continent, with dwindling energy supplies and inflation rising, it is easy to fall into the warped narrative of Eurosceptics. I cannot talk about a single market without mentioning the regretful departure of the United Kingdom, where we truly understood what it means to be part of the single market. We also saw what the single market meant during the COVID—19 pandemic. On the one hand, the unilateral measures by Member States caused disruption and panic, while on the other hand, the joint procurement of vaccines and the adoption of the Recovery and Resilience Facility showed Europe’s ability to react quickly and effectively when acting together.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is why moments and celebrations like these are important to remember just how far we have come, why our way of open markets and societies works, and why we need to continue preserving and promoting our single market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, Europe is at a crossroads. Our European way of doing things is being put into question. This is exactly the time when we need to build on our biggest assets. We must speed up investment in Europe to put the European economy back on the stable path of growth. But for this to happen, we also need to do more to level the playing field, especially as we accelerate the green and digital transitions of our economies. The adoption of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act are key steps in the right direction – ones that we can be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear colleagues, we have done a lot in the past decade. We have come together as a union and we have transformed the lives of millions of Europeans. But 30 years after its launch, the single market is still developing and adapting to new challenges. My hope going forward is to recapture this sense of spirit and, in doing so, to renew our engagement to bring the single market back to European citizens. And this is how we will be able to rest assured that it will not take another 30 years to finish what we have started.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now give the floor to Minister for European Affairs Ms Roswall. Jessika, you have the floor.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am looking forward to many other debates also.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market and its four freedoms are one of the biggest achievements of the European Union. Over the last three decades, the single market has proven to be a powerful driver for competitiveness, cohesion among Member States and prosperity for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the single market counts over 460 million consumers who have access to a wide selection of goods, services, and better job opportunities across the EU. Consumers benefit from our single market rules, which ensure safe and high—quality products and services. These rules have in many cases become international standards, reinforcing the EU’s role as a norm-setter at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is also a driver for innovation. Europe has managed shortages of products during times of crisis by encouraging innovation and diversifying supply chains across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As we come out of the COVID—19 crisis and its effect on supply chains, we now face a series of challenges to our economy as a result of Russia’s war of aggression. In light of this, it is important to recall the well—functioning single market is our best ally for a competitive and resilient European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is not a finished project and will never be, as was said in the film. It’s constantly moving. More work is needed to deepen it, to remove remaining barriers, and to prevent new ones from emerging. In the current global economic context, we cannot waste this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead, the single market is also our main instrument for achieving the green and digital transitions. The ingredients of our success of the last thirty years – common regulations, standard-setting, mutual recognition, consumer protection, level playing field and innovation – it is the recipe for successfully mastering this twin transition as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the digital transition, new rules and regulations for the digital age have already been adopted – including the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act – and many more will be adopted shortly. Such rulebooks, if wisely designed, will make Europe a global standard-setter for the digital world.</p>
<p class="contents">Digital companies within the service economy are the perfect example of why we need a fully functioning single market with harmonised rules – because there are no physical borders in the digital economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is also instrumental to reach the objective of climate neutrality by 2050. The EU needs to be a front-runner in the green transition and make sure that Fit for 55 is fully implemented. That’s the reason why we will prioritise both the green transition and competitiveness during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Only about a month ago we invited the European Parliament’s Conference of Presidents to Stockholm and last week the College of Commissioners to Kiruna in the north of Sweden to see the green transition in practice, and how it is a business opportunity for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The 30th anniversary of the single market will continue to be highlighted during the Swedish Presidency of the Council. The EU needs a new, long—term plan and a vision for how the single market can be a strong and sustainable engine for jobs, entrepreneurship, and sustainable growth over the next 30 years to come. Let us work together to achieve this. Thank you very much for your attention.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thirty years, experienced, still sparkling.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is one of the greatest achievements of European integration. It’s the backbone of the European economy, and it’s a source of prosperity, of wealth for Europeans being transferred into welfare for the individual citizen. Without it, not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">For 30 years now, the single market has provided countless benefits to every European. The single market enables us to live, to work, to travel wherever we wish in Europe. It offers consumers protection, safety, greater choice at lower prices. And we can trust the products that we purchase in the Union as they are safe and based on the same standards. And with the work done in this Parliament, this will indeed also be even more true in the future when we purchase things online.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, consumers can be assured that companies operating in the single market, that they respect high labour standards, that they respect the environment. And even more so when we get, hopefully, to an adoption of the platform workers legislation. So it also goes when it’s online.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses, they have access to 450, 460 million people. And that, of course, is the basis for opportunities for scaling, for building amazing companies. And the single market has changed the way we trade with one another. It is not the same. We have removed trade barriers. We have removed physical customs controls, which made trading goods both costly and unpredictable. And now we have seen it live with the sad story of Brexit and all the troubles that come back.</p>
<p class="contents">National rules, well, they prevented companies from trading across border. They are now harmonised. Obstacles for more than 80% of physical industrial products have been removed. And the single market plays a crucial role in our efforts to tackle climate change, ensure clean energy sources and developing digital technologies. The single market makes things happen.</p>
<p class="contents">And when we celebrate the 30th birthday, I think we can be really proud of what we have achieved together as a result of our European democracy. But as we celebrate and look back, I also think about all these achievements, that we cannot take it for granted. This is not a given. This is not forever.</p>
<p class="contents">We are instead dealing with a precious asset that needs to be preserved every day for the well-being of the single market, also for the next 30 years. More ambition, more effort is needed to simply pursue further integration of the single market and to take away the barriers that keep creeping in.</p>
<p class="contents">There are intense discussions about how to improve Europe’s competitiveness and to accelerate the twin transitions. We are looking at our state-aid rules to amend and to simplify where necessary. And it can be a short—term boost, of course, but we do not build competitiveness out of subsidies. This must be a temporary adjustment. We build competitiveness out of a well—functioning, dynamic and innovative market.</p>
<p class="contents">And also, of course, there can be no successful twin transition without the single market. I continue hearing companies and citizens reporting a number of persistent obstacles, such as the misapplication of rules from one Member State to another, or lengthy or diverse national administrative procedures that hampers cross—border trade, that hampers investment within the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">And we need to answer to that, because these are the fundamentals of this Union, and we need to take upon these issues obviously very seriously, not by continuing making more rules. This is not a competition of piling up burdensome requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to do what we do best: provide a stable and manageable regulatory framework, both for our companies, for our administration, a regulatory framework that can travel because it sets a standard; sparkling and experienced. It has been said that you cannot fall in love with the single market. Well, I’m passionate about it. I hope you share it with me.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Anna Cavazzini (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection</span>. – Madam President, I think it’s great that we have such a female line up at this ceremony. </p>
<p class="contents">Dear President, dear Minister, dear Vice-President, dear colleagues, 30 years of the EU’s single market means 30 years of living, working and studying in other EU Member States. It means more prosperity and opportunities for our businesses. Market integration has led to European integration, to citizens growing closer together. And I’m from a generation that can’t remember how it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">And now I could talk to you about how much GDP growth the internal market has brought us, about trade flows, about increasing competitiveness. And all of this is certainly very, very important. But I rather want to talk about what the single market means to us as citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">I know some people are convinced that you cannot fall in love with the internal market, and Jacques Delors certainly was one of them. But I have to say, similarly to Margrethe, I get a lot of excited feedback from citizens when I talk to them about our current internal market legislation. With the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, we created democratic rules for the online world. As the first continent worldwide with legislation on circular economy and the right to repair, we are making sustainability the norm in our market. And then – this is really a project to fall in love with – there will be very soon only one common charger in the EU. Can you have a nicer symbol of the EU internal market? </p>
<p class="contents">These examples show that in the past 30 years, the task of creating a common market has evolved from completing the market with its four freedoms – goods, services, capital and people – to using it more and more to achieve our common political goals: strategic autonomy; a new and unique European model of the digital world; high consumer standards; and, very importantly, the protection of our planet and the climate. And this is also the story that we have to tell to citizens today. Indeed, no one will fall in love with the abstract idea of economic integration. But citizens want high consumer protection standards, a healthy economy, environmental protection. And I think the single market can deliver if we do it in the right way. </p>
<p class="contents">So if we look back, was everything shiny and rosy in the last years? Certainly not. Several crises have marked the past 30 years and we are right in the middle of one of them. But with each crisis, the single market has evolved. It has proven to be part of the solution. Let me look at that a bit and see what we can learn.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, to get support from our EU citizens, the single market must protect them. Huge protests all over Europe were the consequence of people believing that the Commission went too far in the market integration with the Services Directive. This Parliament had changed the proposal back in 2006 – made it more balanced. We in this House have successfully fought for a stronger social dimension of the single market in the past years. And I believe we must continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Brexit, with the UK not only leaving the EU but also the single market, was probably one of the biggest crises for all of us. And, sadly enough, the current performance of the UK economy and the mounting challenges that businesses and citizens face make the rest of the EU even more aware of the benefits of the single market and how dangerous it is to throw everything overboard light-heartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">During the pandemic, supply chains got heavily disrupted, adding to citizens’ and businesses’ hardships. EU internal borders closed up. We managed to get on our feet again, thanks to the single market, its benefits, its principles protecting European solidarity, common procurement of vaccines, authorising trucks to cross borders to prevent shortages. A common approach to rebuilding the economy. It became obvious once more: we are stronger together. </p>
<p class="contents">And, dear colleagues, allow me a last point. When it comes to the challenges we are facing right now, I think once again focusing on European cooperation and leveraging the strength of the single market would bring us forward. The climate crisis is looming. The past seven years have been the hottest in the recorded history. And, on the other hand, European companies are not only facing high energy prices, but also fierce global competition to lead the future’s global green economy. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me be very clear. We cannot prioritise competitiveness over solving the climate crisis. Solutions have to go hand in hand. We need to massively accelerate climate measures and to finance the green transition, which in turn will help European companies. But all of this cannot be at the expense of the single market, with Member States outspending each other. Investing in the single market is the solution, enabling it to be a life jacket for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
