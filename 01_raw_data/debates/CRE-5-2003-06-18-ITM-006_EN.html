<p class="contents">I would like to join the President in warmly welcoming the representatives of the Iranian Parliament, headed by the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, with whom I had the opportunity to meet yesterday and have a wonderful conversation on topical issues, issues which we will have the opportunity to discuss this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin with a few brief words on the situation in the Middle East, Mr President, which, despite the rays of hope we have seen over recent days, is still extremely difficult. We must be aware that every possible effort should be directed towards initiating the peace process, which is unfortunately not being implemented, although there have been moments of hope in recent hours and recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roadmap, which was produced by the Quartet, has finally been accepted by both sides, by Palestinians and by the Israeli Government. As you know, in recent days there have been certain very important meetings, one in Sharm El Sheik, in Egypt, and another important one in Aqaba, where three speeches, the speech by the President of the United States, the speech by Prime Minister Sharon and the speech by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, had the air of very important declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, that moment, which seemed as if it would lead to certain positive results, we have seen, if not die away, at least pass through a difficult phase as a result of the resurgence of violence in the occupied territories and in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, immediately after the meeting in Aqaba, acts of violence took place, terrorist actions and responses to them, creating the unstoppable spiral which we have unfortunately been witnessing for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, I would highlight the Quartet meeting on Friday of the envoys to the region, headed by Mr Moratinos representing the European Union, which has been positive and which will allow us to hold a new meeting on Sunday of the Quartet in Amman, which will be attended by its principal leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this meeting will be to consider how we can continue to promote the process which was opened up following the meetings in Sharm El Sheik and Aqaba, which led to the approval of the Roadmap by both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roadmap must be applied. If the international community is not able to do everything possible to see that the Roadmap is applied, we will be faced with the same failure that we faced when the Mitchell Plan was presented, or when the Tenet Plan was presented. Till now we have been able to produce sensible documents, documents which were full of hope, but which, unfortunately, the parties have not been able, with the help of the international community, to implement. The fulfilment of the Roadmap must be our objective and the international community must make every possible effort to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, as you know, two types of negotiation are underway, a negotiation which we could call ‘intra-Palestinian’ and another between Palestine and Israel. At the moment, it may be that we are once again seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">You are well aware of the intra-Palestinian negotiation. It is taking place between Prime Minister Abu Mazen and the factions which have rejected the Roadmap and which have not supported the statements made in Aqaba. There is a negotiation with the political leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the hope of reaching a ceasefire agreement soon, not a short ceasefire but rather one which really allows the more political aspects of the Roadmap to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a negotiation between the Palestinian Authorities at the moment, headed by the Interior Minister, Mohamed Dahlan, and the Israeli authorities, with a view to achieving an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, or at least from part of it, and the leaders of the Palestinian Authority fully taking up their security responsibilities. If this were to be agreed, it would have consequences for all of us; we would also have to make an effort to help the Palestinian Authority, from an economic point of view, so that it could rapidly restore and construct at least a part of its security infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that the control of this process is absolutely fundamental to the application of the Roadmap. If there is nobody on the ground able to give their opinion, to analyse and to observe how this process is developing, I believe it will be very difficult to move forward and to achieve a good result. We are being offered an opportunity to bring this process to a successful conclusion, and you know that the objective would be defined by the existence of two states, two states which could live together in peace, and within a regional context, with which all the other countries of the region could establish diplomatic and other types of relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, in Luxembourg, the General Affairs Council met in the morning with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority, a friend of many of us, Nabil Shaat, and in the evening we received the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister. As the honourable Members will imagine, we are working in close cooperation with all the countries of the region in order to try to ensure that the opportunity offered by the Roadmap leads to a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago I had the opportunity to travel to all the countries of the region for the preparation of the Luxembourg Council, and I can tell you that there is a great desire for the application of the Roadmap to begin; and at the same time there is a great fear that, if this opportunity is missed, we may have missed the final opportunity to find a peaceful and lasting solution which puts an end to the frustration and suffering of so many people over so long. Therefore, to stop the violence, to stop the selective assassinations, are things which we must achieve amongst all of us so that we can implement the Roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to make a couple of comments while the President of the Iranian Foreign Affairs Committee is present. As I said, yesterday I was able to hold a good conversation with him, but I would also like to say that on Monday a statement was made in the External Relations Council, of which I hope all the honourable Members are aware, on relations between Iran and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to our Iranian friends, who are here with us this afternoon, that the European Union sees Iran as a great country. It is a great country with which we want to have solid relations, with which we are involved in serious negotiations with two approaches, one of an economic nature and one of a political nature.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the political aspect which affects me most directly. It has to do with human rights, with the renunciation of support for any form of terrorism and with the nuclearisation of the Republic of Iran. The honourable Members will be aware that the International Atomic Energy Agency, through its Director-General, Mr ElBaradei, whom many of us know, has been making certain clear statements on the behaviour of Iran and how it should behave in order to comply with the appeals and suggestions of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said yesterday with all respect and affection to the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the European Union believes it is absolutely essential that our Iranian friends sign the additional protocol. There is absolutely no reason for them not to do so. Furthermore, our Iranian friends should not ask for anything in exchange, to sign the additional protocol is something which is in line with what countries such as Iran and the countries making up the European Union want: a world in which there is no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a world in which energy is used for peaceful purposes in a manner which is controlled by the organs of the United Nations, and therefore, to sign, to comply with all the requirements of United Nations, seems to us to be absolutely fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Our hope and desire is that the good sense of the Iranian authorities and people will mean that this demand, which we Europeans are making in good faith, becomes a reality as soon as possible. They must sign the additional protocol and they should do so without expecting anything in exchange other than to continue constructive and positive relations with their friends in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this first speech I have been asked to give you some brief information about Operation Artemis, the operation currently being carried out by the European Union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the region of Ituri and more specifically in the city of Bunia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that this is the first military operation the European Union has carried out without the assistance of any other organisation. It is the exclusive responsibility of the European Union. It is an autonomous operation requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, who contacted me a few days ago to find out whether the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to an operation of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The operation is not easy. It is complex, and therefore everything possible has been done so that it may fulfil its objective and so that the European Union may complete this commitment with its head held high and having implemented a resolution of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, immediately after responding to the Secretary-General that the European Union was prepared to carry out this task, the Security Council approved Resolution 1484 which defines the limits of this mission both in terms of space and in terms of time. But I would like to insist that in a genuinely record time, in less than two weeks from the first contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the European Union has been able to implement a whole complex operational set-up for the first military peace-keeping operation carried out by the European Union autonomously in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to be able to say this, because many people in the Council, the Commission and the General Staff of the European Union have worked day and night producing high-quality documents which have allowed forces to be deployed in absolutely record time. And in relation to this thought, I would like to point out that we are midway through 2003. At the beginning of 2000, following the meeting of the European Council in Helsinki, we were asked to put ourselves in a position in 2003 or at the end of 2003 to be able to carry out peace-keeping operations of a military or civilian nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we can all be proud, Parliament, the Council, the Commission, all the citizens of Europe, of the fact that halfway through 2003, the European Union is currently committed to three peace-keeping operations: one in Bosnia, as you know, continuing operations begun by the United Nations, another in Skopje taking over an operation begun by the Atlantic Alliance and one currently in Ituri, an operation begun by the European Union which I hope can be completed by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us who have participated, therefore, can feel somewhat satisfied and proud: Parliament, the Commission, the Council, our colleagues in the General Staff, of having managed in such a short space of time to implement three operations which we must feel proud of, and I believe that Parliament must feel this and that we must also communicate it to the European citizens: the European Union is still working ceaselessly, with all the resources and capacities at its disposal, to try to make the world we are living in fairer and better and to ensure that the European Union plays a significant role in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that Operation Artemis is going to be a difficult one. The honourable Members are aware that a few days ago we began to deploy the force. There are now 400 soldiers in the region. The operation is being led by a French commander, and France will act as the framework-nation for the operation. There are forces from many countries of the European Union, a significant proportion, but also from third countries, from Africa and from other areas of the world, such as Latin America, deployed as part of this operation led by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the mandates issued to us by the Secretary-General of United Nations, we hope that this transition can be made when this force leaves the region of Ituri; a smooth transition to a fundamentally African administration and to this end we are in contact with the leaders of southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">This operation in the Congo is not just a peace-keeping operation. We want to help to keep the peace so that we can accompany the operation with intensive diplomatic action. Since before the operation began and every day since it began on the 12th, I have maintained contact with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the Presidents of the neighbouring republics, in particular Rwanda and Uganda, the countries which have been most closely involved with the region of Ituri in the north of the Congo. In a few days time I will travel to the region to try to give diplomatic impetus to the situation which has now been going on for a long time. As a result of this European Union cooperation we will perhaps be able to see the establishment of a provisional government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and we may glimpse signs of peace in these regions where, while there is unfortunately so much poverty, suffering and misery, there is also so much wealth underground.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank, on behalf of all of us, the country which is heading this operation, France, and all the members participating in it including – as I have said – countries from outside the continent, and I would like to address very directly our friends in Canada, which has not had the least hesitation in involving its forces in an operation led by the Europeans. Canada has demonstrated once again its affection and respect for the European Union and, more importantly, the fact that it has such a similar view of the world's problems as the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end this first speech here. I believe I have left nothing out, but if I have, I am sure that everything will become clear when I reply to your questions.</p>

Mr President, the High Representative has just eloquently demonstrated how close hope and despair are in the Middle East. Following the presentation of the Roadmap and the Sharm-el-Sheikh and Aqaba Summits, there seemed to be a much better chance for peace<span class="bold">.</span> Alas, the ongoing violence is again putting this at serious risk. We, the European Union – and much more so the peoples in the Middle East – cannot afford to lose the opportunity for peace which has been created by the Roadmap, small though it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Now more than ever it is crucial that the Roadmap should be implemented without being taken hostage by extremists who do not want peace. Despite the violence of last week I hope that Palestinians and Israelis, with support from the international community, will generate sufficient confidence to allow them to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to reflect now on how we in the European Union could help on this. I can see several areas where the European Union and the Commission, in particular, could make a useful contribution:</p>
<p class="contents">First we ought to continue supporting Palestinian institution-building and reform, as we have already done with a successful record in the past. Secondly, we should contribute to the Roadmap’s monitoring process and put pressure on Arab States to help dry up funds to extremist groups and to close the offices of those groups. We should also press Israel to moderate its responses to the unspeakably atrocious suicide bombings which many Arab leaders have themselves condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue our concrete support to the reform process and will also assist the new Palestinian cabinet in achieving its ambitious goals. In 2003, the Community will provide a EUR 132 million support package for Palestinian institutional reform and respond to the deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation. But clearly, the reform needs to go further in other areas as well: one that I have particularly pressed on Palestinian officials, even this week, is the judiciary. We would also like to see elections held by the end of the first phase of the Roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has done a lot of work with the Palestinian authority, especially with the Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, which I am pleased to say has led to a successful reform process. This is by no means completed, and we therefore continue working closely with the Palestinian authority on reform conditions for our support during this year. Minister Fayyad has confirmed that with our latest help he has succeeded in consolidating public-sector revenues and there is much greater budgetary transparency with monthly budget execution reports available, even on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms, together with external financial assistance, have allowed him to increase expenditure in Gaza and West Bank since the beginning of the year by meeting arrears and salary payments. Boosting aggregate demand was, in his view, the most important contribution that could be made at this stage to alleviating the severe constraints on the Palestinian economy. As a possible next step, easing restrictions on freedom of movement, including to Jordan and Egypt, would greatly help to revive economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Further progress is needed. Next week, the European Union-Palestinian Joint Committee will be discussing all these issues. We will also explore ways and means of making better use of the Interim Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Quartet, the European Union will need to look at the monitoring mechanism.<span class="bold"> </span>All Quartet partners should be able to contribute. The Commission is certainly ready to support this important work through our experience and activities in reform and institution-building, but also in the areas of economic and humanitarian issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another area where we in the European Union will need to step up our efforts: the request of the Roadmap for all Arab states to cut off public and private funding for the groups engaged in violence and terror. We discussed this point at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting on Crete. We encouraged Arab states to channel aid funds through the single account of the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance. But we should use our partnership with Arab countries to address this extremely important point.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, issues that need to be dealt with urgently in the context of the Roadmap and together with the United States: for example, the rapidly expanding settlement activities and the so-called security wall which is biting into the West Bank. Both undermine the envisaged two-State solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally worrying is the worsening humanitarian situation which is compounded by restrictions on humanitarian access. These new measures have a negative impact on the operation of international donors and will make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to undertake humanitarian and development tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome, however, confidence-building measures on the Israeli side such as the removal of so-called illegal settlement outposts, the lifting of curfews, the release of prisoners and the provision of more work permits for Palestinians. Additional proactive measures would help win the hearts and minds of the population and would reduce the attraction and influence of those who are so bitterly opposed to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, we are willing to help but it is up to the Israeli and Palestinian parties to take the first step. Without their political will and commitment nothing will change. The killing will go on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say a few additional words, following what the High Representative said about Iran and our relationship with Iran. I welcome, as you did Mr President, a delegation from the Parliament in Iran to the official gallery here today. I too have enjoyed discussions with them this week and, indeed, enjoyed discussions with them in Tehran.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last year and more, we have made it clear to our interlocutors in Iran that we want to develop a sophisticated, comprehensive relationship with them; which recognises that Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; which recognises Iran's enormous geo-strategic importance in the region and, indeed, in the world; and which recognises that the outcome of the debate on democracy in Iran is important not just for the region but for all of us. It is a genuine debate and we watch it and listen to it with considerable interest.</p>
<p class="contents">We have started, as the House knows, a series of discussions with Iran. We have three tracks of discussions: one on human rights, one on political issues such as the use, manufacture and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the third on trade and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had two rounds of talks on the first two of those issues, three rounds of talks on the first two, and four rounds of talks on trade and cooperation. The Council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is interlinked, that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others.</p>
<p class="contents">We can point to some progress. We cannot, alas, point to as much progress as a result of the human rights dialogue as we would like, though we welcome, for instance, the agreement to allow thematic UN rapporteurs to return to Iran. There has been considerable progress on the trade and cooperation agenda where there have been very good and thorough discussions on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, on political issues, and in particular on the issue to which the High Representative drew attention – nuclear matters and the transparency surrounding Iran's nuclear programme – we have not enjoyed the progress that we would have like to have seen. This is not a new point for us. Every meeting I have had with any Iranian official – every meeting – has involved a call for Iran to sign the additional Protocol to the International Atomic Energy Agency. It was a point that the High Representative and I made when we went to Tehran in the immediate aftermath of 11 September. It was a point which, again, I made on a recent and extremely valuable visit to Tehran.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is not an issue to which the European Union has come recently. It is not a question of us parroting other peoples' concerns. These are real concerns for us and we want to see them addressed. Iran is a sovereign nation and it makes its own decisions but I hope it will make decisions which will make it easier for it to get on with Europe, for it to get on with the rest of the world and for Europe to get on with Iran. That is what we would like to see but this has to be a two-way process of engagement. There has to be a recognition in Iran that when we talk about weapons of mass destruction we are deadly serious, not perhaps as deadly as the weapons, but certainly profoundly serious about what we want to see as the outcome.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the acceptance by the different parties of the Roadmap has followed a tremendous wave of violence in the region and unfortunately this is a relatively normal and well-known pattern. At times of hope there are always people whose extremism and radicalism lead them to commit acts aimed at undermining peace efforts. However, the international community is now closely involved: the United Nations, the European Union – we must not underestimate the role of the European Union – the United States and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one fact which I believe to be irrefutable and that is that, since the beginning of the second Intifada, there have been more than 2 700 victims on the Palestinian side and almost 800 on the Israeli side. In other words, everybody loses here: the Israelis lose their security and the Palestinians lose the possibility of economic and political development, in other words the possibility of well-being for its people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is placing particular emphasis on increasing its diplomatic efforts, in order to ensure that – as Mr Solana has said – peace is based on the idea of two states, Israel and Palestine, living together in peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it appropriate to state here, when we are on the point of voting on an important resolution on transatlantic relations, that we should be pleased to note that the United States are prepared, together with us, to make an effort to move the Roadmap forward; and I believe that the comments of the President of that country, following the latest acts of violence and terrorism in the region, are a guarantee of this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to move forward and to consolidate the achievements made, and to continue working on the basis of the application of the Roadmap. It is urgent that the verification mechanism be established and made operational as soon as possible. I believe that not only the United States but also the European Union and the United Nations have sufficient resources on the ground to begin this essential task and I believe that we Europeans must work with total pragmatism and realism in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore celebrate the fact that the peace process now includes the very active participation of the international community, which is now accepted by everyone to be indispensable. I believe that we Europeans are furthermore faced with two inescapable tasks: on the one hand, to give our full support to the Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, helping him to achieve the necessary trust of his people, of Israel and of the international community. And therefore, Mr President, I believe it is very important for Parliament's Bureau to invite him here so that he can give us his impressions and share his views with this House. The results of the meeting he held the day before yesterday with 13 organisations demonstrate the urgency of this task.</p>
<p class="contents">We must help him to convince the Palestinian population that the government he leads, under the presidency – we must not forget – of President Arafat, is in an historic position. By the way, I would like to express my disapproval of the isolation which President Arafat is being subjected to, an isolation which I believe is of no use to anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The second job I believe falls to us, and this was noted by this Parliament’s delegation for relations with Israel, is the need to make an effort to restore the confidence of an Israeli society which lives in constant fear of terrorist attack. On the issue of terrorism I believe this Parliament has been clear and firm, and we must continue to be so. No type of terrorist act is justified; we cannot distinguish either between terrorists or between their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not end, Mr President, without greeting and welcoming our colleagues from the Iranian Parliament and expressing my agreement with the words of the High Representative in relation to that country and, in particular, his request to the Iranian authorities. Iran is indeed a great country with which this Parliament – as we all hope and wish – must strengthen its friendly relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the publication of the Roadmap on 30 April offers a new opportunity to try to resolve a conflict which has led to seven wars in 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I believe we must distinguish between the Roadmap, which is an itinerary, and the journey itself. I would like to refer to a poem, which the High Representative will know well, by a great poet, Antonio Machado, who said that ‘the path is made by walking’. The Roadmap may exist on paper, but what we have to do is to create the whole path with an objective which, for the first time, the whole Quartet, and not just certain countries, recognise. The international community believes that there must be a firm and definitive peace agreement based on the existence of two democratic and sovereign states, living together in peace within secure and recognised borders, and even accepting that, for the moment, a divorce may be better than living together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that this is achieved by moving forward together and not by vetoing. And just as, in the previous debate, I criticised the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Sharon, did not receive the High Representative when he visited the Middle East, I also believe we must ask the next President—in-Office of the Council, the Italian Prime Minister, when he goes to the Middle East, not just to visit Israel, but also the Palestinian Authority. Our strength lies precisely in our ability to talk to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe we must stress elements which can help the Roadmap, the joint path, to move forward. For example, the Palestinian Authority has taken steps: the reform of the Finance Ministry, the creation of the post of Prime Minister and the support of the Legislative Council. We must not only talk about the Quartet, moreover, but also about those governments which, like Egypt, are making a very significant effort to contribute to the process moving forward, and above all to achieve, together with the Palestinian militia organisations, a break in hostilities; and I believe that the meeting of the Quartet in Amman on the 22 is an important step that we must support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Hamas must leave behind the use of indiscriminate violence and that we must appeal to it and consider including it on the list of terrorist organisations unless things change. We must also ask the Israeli Government, which has the most strength in political, moral and military terms, to fulfil its part of the Roadmap, dismantling the illegal settlements in the occupied territories and putting an end to the policy of selective assassinations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the steps which must be taken, I believe we must encourage perseverance. We must also – and in this regard I would point out that Commissioner Günter Verheugen has just been in Israel – tell our Israeli friends that we are prepared to intensify our relations at all levels, as long as they also want to do so and are prepared to treat us as we deserve, particularly in view of the political will we have demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this process, all we can ask for is perseverance, to seek the possibility of helping these two peoples to move forward together, and an immense dose of patience. And in this regard, at a time when Ambassador Moratinos is on the point of finishing his mission, I believe it should be noted in the Minutes that this group thanks him, as does the whole of Parliament I hope, for the tireless work he has done over all these years.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like to end, Mr President, with two brief references to two issues which have also been dealt with by the High Representative and by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, our relations with Iran. I can only say that the Socialist Group supports intensifying these relations, opening up a new stage of significant relations in the economic and political fields with a young but at the same time very ancient country, with a dynamic and vibrant country, which also wants to open up its society, as is currently being demonstrated by what is happening with the students. We all have experience of the importance of student revolts and demonstrations; they are always an omen of what may happen within society, and I believe it is important to help Iran to find its way as a country. Therefore, as well as signing up to the additional protocol of the Atomic Energy Agency, I also believe that we can contribute to increasing stability in the region, because we must point out that this region needs stability. What it does not need are new points of conflict, because we are facing a multiplication of points of conflict from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean rim. What we have to do in this regard is to put fires out and not generate new ones, and the role of Iran may be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a very brief reference to Operation Artemis. We Europeans have historic responsibilities in Africa and the step taken by the European Union in the Congo is a positive one. Let us not forget that there are masses of conflicts. We have the case of Liberia, for example, which is also currently experiencing civil war. I believe that we in Parliament must dedicate all our resources to the European Union taking a step, which it has taken for the first time on its own, demonstrating that it has the capacity to re-establish normality in a continent to which it owes an enormous historical debt.</p>

The terror organisation rejects the two-State concept and wants to turn Israel into an Islamic state. The spiral of violence will never stop if Israel continues to be provoked by the attacks. The unlawful killing of leaders is, of course, an empty exercise if these are simply replaced. An international military force must be set up as soon as possible, preferably after a file agreement, but if the latter does not materialise, we will have to make do without one. Hamas should then be eliminated by an international military force, if possible in conjunction with NATO, so involving both European and Americans. At the same time, all Hamas’s financial lines need to be severed. Israel and the Palestinians are thoroughly weary of the violence and misery. Finally, under international pressure, a solution is gradually manifesting itself. This is why the road must be blocked to anyone who is intent on more bloodbaths and no peace. Their Roadmap is one to hell.</p>

There is no doubt that the European Union as a whole and the resolute, committed work of the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, have played a major part in drawing up the Roadmap and helping the Palestinian Authority to undertake the series of reforms laid down in the Roadmap, which – as we are quite aware – does not resolve all the issues but is certainly important. Egypt too has played an active role. It is essential, however, that the whole Quartet is involved and supports the talks. It would be too great a risk and, in any case, a mistake to leave management to the USA alone. At the same time, it is essential that we support the talks at all stages without recommitting the errors of the Oslo Agreement when, after the great handshakes, the two parties were left alone with very different power relations, with the result that violence and oppression prevailed instead of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware, I regret to say, of the complicity and subordination of some European leaders in the face of the dominance of the US administration and of the tendency shown by the Israeli Government not to value Europe, Russia and the UN as interlocutors, considering them – wrongly – to be biased towards the Palestinians: wrongly in that it is a question not of bias but of not renouncing the law and justice. In other words, the reality is that international law is not binding for some of these countries. In any case, if it were, if the law were being respected, the issue of Palestine and Israel would have been resolved a long time ago, at least when the PLO opted in 1988 at Algiers to coexist peacefully with the State of Israel and to have its own state in the territories occupied in 1977. The imbalance, symmetry and situation of Palestinians and Israelis, of occupied and occupiers, are not trivial considerations. Quite the opposite: it is essential to stress that it is the Israeli army which is occupying: it is not the Palestinian Authority which is building settlements and holding Palestinians prisoner. The utterly despicable terrorist acts against civilians are perpetrated by Palestinian extremists, not by an army duly equipped with weapons, although in saying this I am not absolving the Palestinian Authority of errors and weaknesses which have harmed the cause of a just peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roadmap offering a possibility of peace for both peoples is, once again, a challenge and a source of hope, but if we genuinely want Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, we do, of course, need to call upon the Palestinian Authority to make every endeavour to stop the terrorist acts – and Abu Mazen, with the support of President Arafat, is pursuing the path of dialogue with great determination to stop the violence and prevent a civil war – but we must also call very strongly upon Ariel Sharon to comply with the initial stages of the Roadmap and bring to an end the targeted assassinations which seem to be intended precisely to provoke terrorist reactions. Mr Sharon has said that three and a half million Palestinians cannot be ruled with military occupation. Then let him act upon his words, as Gedeon Levi, a <span class="italic">Ha’aretz</span> reporter says. Let him remove the checkpoints and stop the hunger and the demolition of houses, let the sick and nursing mothers have access to hospitals, let children no longer see their parents being beaten up or humiliated in the dead of night. This will lend impetus to the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a monstrosity which Commissioner Patten mentioned too: the wall, the wall of separation, of apartheid, of annexing of territory. It is eight metres high and 364 kilometres long, protected by barbed wire and with electronic controls. The wall represents annexing of territory: 30 water wells seized, 16 Palestinian villages separated from cultivatable land. Ariel Sharon has given orders for construction work on the wall to carry on even during the night, and 374 kilometres are not enough for him – the banks of the Jordan are to be cut off by the wall too.</p>
<p class="contents">We must exert pressure with the instruments we have to bring about the creation of two peoples and two states. We support Kofi Annan’s call, backed by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, to send an international peacekeeping force to stop Palestinian and Israeli deaths. It is already long overdue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was three years ago that a delegation had been there. Our visit to, for example, the Knesset was very informative, and the hope was expressed of maintaining better relations in future. Needless to say, the Roadmap was the topic of conversation. During our visit, there were also terrorist attacks in Jerusalem which we condemned unequivocally, but the Roadmap remained, and Prime Minister Sharon eventually expressed his support for this plan. Despite this, he continues to make matters worse by the army's campaign of slaughter in the occupied territories. Something basic is missing from the step-by-step plan. It is a process that requires external guidance, because mutual distrust is too entrenched. The proposal to set up an international peace force is therefore a much-needed addition to the step-by-step plan. The colour of the helmets is of lesser importance. The Union has a role to play here, for we have an historic responsibility in this region that is so close to the Union. The Union must claim a more prominent role in the Quartet, and I hope that this will happen under the Italian Presidency. Cooperation with the United States will be important for the further development of transatlantic relations. If the Union takes a united stand, we can play a key role. For historic and humanitarian reasons, we owe it to ourselves to bring peace to that region.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is very hard to believe that since the historic meetings in Aqaba on 4 June 2003, 65 people have now been killed in what is a horrifying escalation of violence in the region. That violence includes a Palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in Jerusalem and a number of Israeli attacks on members of Hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas.</p>
<p class="contents">All right-minded people support the Roadmap for peace because this will ensure the creation of a future Palestinian State with territorial contiguity. The Roadmap also calls for the immediate dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities. We must all ensure that we encourage Hamas to return to ceasefire talks with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmood Abbas. It is vitally important that the parties proceed with the implementation of the Roadmap elaborated by the international community, and that each side fully meets their obligations under this plan. Immediate implementation of the Roadmap is vital if one is to generate momentum for a peace settlement in the region. However, the brutal violence of the last fortnight, and indeed over the last 33 months of the intifada, has deepened animosities and intensified emotional hatreds. But we must seek to renew engagement between the Palestinians and the Israelis at all costs, and the European Union must play a central and pivotal role in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the difficulties that remain regarding the issues of refugees and settlements but I do call on leaders from both sides to stand firm in their support of the Roadmap. If this process is to be a success, we must achieve progress along the political, economic and security tracks at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to comments made by Commissioner Patten and by the High Representative Mr Solana in relation to the visiting Iranian delegation, I too am very pleased that this delegation is here this week, and I am very glad about the comments that have been made here today by both Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten. As Commissioner Patten said, the agenda for the talks which are presently under way is a very serious European agenda and one that must be addressed before we can make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the regional orders known as the ‘Roadmap’ are concerned, although we are not surprised that it has been shattered into a thousand pieces in recent days, we still want to point out that the cause of this is very simple: for us, as supporters of sovereignty, we cannot conceive of peace without sovereignty and without the freedom of nations in balance. Without the balance of nations, there will be no peace. Yet the entire United States policy consists of accentuating the imbalances: the global imbalances, of course, as this superpower no longer recognises any boundaries, but also the regional imbalances, and that, in relation to this issue on the agenda, is undoubtedly the most serious aspect of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the entire United States policy consists of destroying all Arab powers when they emerge: it is very clear that that is the main reason behind its relentless attacks on Iraq, since it is a well-known fact that it does not want to see a modern and developed Arab power. Its policy also consists of supporting the extremists on both sides, both the Israeli and the Palestinian extremists, at times using Machiavellian practices that are sinister when one dares to look closely at them.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, alongside that, there is this European policy – or at least there would be this European policy if Europe existed – that is actually the policy of France and consists of doing exactly the opposite, in other words supporting the moderates on both sides, both Israeli and Palestinian. As I have said, that is the policy of France and I hope that if some day Europe manages to have some kind of influence over the events in that poor world, it will realise that it is the wisest path to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Creating, in a territory which is smaller than Normandy or Belgium, which says it all – I am talking in terms of square kilometres, of course, for I would not be so impolite as to make other allusions – two states: two independent states, mind you, not one US state and one Russian state. High Representative, the foreign, structural policy which we are pursuing there is exactly the opposite of the policy we have been committed to for 50 years with a view to the day – for pity’s sake, it does not even occur to you because you are of sound mind, whereas I am a little nutty in the sense that I look forward to that day – when we can be citizens of the European Union without paying the price of being citizens of Italy, or France, or the United Kingdom. Certainly not, you are concerned solely with the states. We must resolve matters through states, by creating another Palestinian State. Never mind the fact that there could be another state, the State of Jordan, which is already a larger, stronger, more democratic Palestinian state than we could possibly imagine your Palestinian State to be. <span class="italic">Your</span> state, for pity’s sake! Then there is the problem of the Lebanon, but you are not concerned with anything beyond the fact that it is a state, never mind that it is a cover for Syria and everything which is most execrable in that region, in Mediterranean Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, Commissioner Patten, I know that the evil is present here too, first and foremost, in Parliament. We must fight alongside the antifascists and the anticommunists – with Altiero Spinelli, Ernesto Rossi and Robert Schuman, with those who conceived Europe not as a geographical entity but as the home of the law, of the <span class="italic">Torah</span>, of literature, of democracy – against national bureaucracies, inadequate as vessels of freedom, liberation and prosperity. Now you are trying to impose this famous Roadmap. I was in Jerusalem with our fellow Members and I said: ‘The Roadmap? A day, a week, a month? Two Palestinian states? All these Foreign Ministers, all these thieving, corrupt ministers?’ Yes, they are thieving and corrupt, as are many French, Italians, Germans, British and Americans; but there, corruption has another dimension: it is corruption of the body, of freedom, of the law. We must not set them off along that road. We must not encourage it.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the High Commissioner kindly spend a brief moment telling us about our European army, which has, at last, been sent to the Congo? At last! And under whose control have we placed it? Focard’s heirs! I repeat: Focard’s heirs! We are entrusting peacekeeping in that area to those whose attempts at decolonisation have resulted in foul massacres which are worse than those of the colonial period.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you luck, Mr President. I wish you luck, fellow Members. High Representative, Commissioner, I wish you luck. We need it. I look forward to the time when I, the Israelis and the Palestinians will have the right to citizenship which is not your or our prisons.

The Roadmap is essentially a method which the European Union applies all over the world. It is how we have shaped our enlargement process: by setting a goal and then providing support – both financial and political – for the stages along this road to enlargement. I regret that in the past, this well-established European principle sometimes seemed to be forgotten or appeared suspect, for there was an impression that no matter how much terrorism there was, no matter how much intifada or violence occurred, we Europeans act as if nothing had happened and carry on paying and maintaining contacts with President Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that we have moved away from this. It is a good thing that Commissioner Patten has transformed budget aid into project aid again, that he is now involved in the reform of the Palestinian Authority, that we have very close contacts to the Palestinian Finance Minister, that we say a resounding ‘yes’ to Prime Minister Abbas and give him our support, and that we meet rather less often and less vocally, perhaps, with Mr Arafat. We do not need to isolate him, but we must make it clear where Europe's sympathies lie. We may have been a little late in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are now making tougher demands of ourselves, and we should be making these same demands of the neighbouring countries as well. Now that Iraq no longer has Saddam Hussein as a dictator and is hopefully on the way to more democratic structures, we must send a clear message to Syria and Iran. The message is this: if you want to conduct relations with the European Union, you must say ‘yes’ to the Roadmap and participate in the process as well. We have made this very clear to our Iranian colleagues over the last few days. Maintaining good relations with the European Union while supporting Hizbollah is not an option. Maintaining a close friendship with the European Union while funding, supporting and cultivating links with the offices of terrorist organisations is not an option. I am therefore grateful to Commissioner Patten and the High Representative for stating this so categorically here today in plenary. If Iran is willing – even in this very difficult situation, also in its relations with the United States – to improve its relations with the European Union, then it would say ‘yes’ to the Roadmap and ‘yes’ to a Palestinian state by 2005, but it would also say ‘yes’ to Israel's right to exist, for even now, this statement is not forthcoming from most of the Arab states who would like to be the European Union's partners. If we were to receive such clear signals, this would strengthen the Middle East peace process as well.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the message to us in the European Parliament: despite all the setbacks, despite all the violence, we will make more demands, not only on ourselves but also on Israel's and Palestine's neighbours, and that includes both sides. It also includes Prime Minister Sharon. He must be told very clearly that there is no room for negotiation on the Roadmap. That is the basis, and that is what we regard as the framework for the Middle East. The settlements must be removed. Here too, there are clear demands on everyone involved in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this clarity has been missing to some extent from Europe's policies over the last two or three years. We now have the chance to come back into the frame with the United States, Russia and the United Nations. I believe this will give fresh impetus to the peace process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hume (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the timing of this discussion is quite important, given the fact that today's world our generation is living through the greatest revolution in history – telecommunications, technology and transport – as a result of which the world is a much smaller place. For that very reason, influential countries like the United States, or many other countries, or indeed the European Union, are in a stronger position to shape that world because it is a smaller place. For that reason it should be the primary objective of the new century that we use that influence to ensure that there will no longer be any wars or conflict. This means that in practice we send our philosophy of peace and reconciliation to areas of conflict. Of course, the best example of conflict resolution in the history of the world is the European Union: that is something that is hardly ever mentioned, and I often think is sometimes forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">The first half of the century we just left was the worst in the history of the world: two World Wars, 50 million human beings slaughtered. Who could have forecast that those same peoples, at the end of that century, would have come together in the European Union? Therefore, the principles at the heart of the European Union, are principles that should be sent to every area of conflict – I know because the three principles of the European Union are the three principles that produced peace on my own streets in Northern Ireland: respect for difference, no victory and the creation of appropriate institutions. Then, through those institutions, we can work together in our common interests and break down the barriers of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see that philosophy of the European Union sent to all areas of conflict in the world, and for that reason the European Union should have a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation backed up by a substantial directorate, that could, instead of sending soldiers to areas of conflict, send a team that would promote dialogue. The first message to the Middle East would of course be to get them to agree in advance that it is people that are divided there, not territory, because without territory even the Middle East is only a jungle, and when people are divided, they should agree that they can never solve their problems by any form of violence. They can only do it by agreement and by sitting down to reach that agreement. I believe there is a major opportunity now for the European Union to lead by example, to give leadership to the world and create a world of lasting peace.</p>

Ariel Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas were talking about peace, making pledges and embarking on the road marked out by the Quartet, a difficult road, without doubt, but one without any alternative. Remarkable things were said. The Palestinian Prime Minister referred to Palestinian terrorism, not political activism but the terrorism and suffering of the Jewish people. The Israeli leader, for his part, confronting some of his cabinet, expressed his clear desire that two peaceful States should coexist side by side in order to end the suffering of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and the United States must now use all their weight to ensure that this fragile window of opportunity, which opened slightly two weeks ago, does not close again on cruelly dashed hopes. There have already been 50 deaths since this summit, affecting both sides, the most recent victim a seven-year-old girl killed yesterday evening by the violence of men. Noam was Israeli, but that is not what is important here. When a child dies, a part of each of us is extinguished. So here, in such a short space of time, we have to say that Europe must make every effort to support the actions of these two men and to prevent the extremists on both sides from continuing to set fire to peace, so as to ensure that Aqaba does not become another Taba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these conditions is the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from the occupied territories. However, neither Sharon nor Bush want that. The first steps to implement the Roadmap are, it must be recognised, pathetic. What is the dismantling of some caravans parked completely illegally compared with the aspiration of a people, with their legitimate right to a State? The continued construction of a security wall, the continued atrocities, the continued policy of targeted assassinations say a great deal about Sharon’s desire to persevere with his fatal logic. This heightens the despair of the entire Palestinian people, but their determination to live in freedom within their own State remains intact and we must support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the European Union cannot remain deaf to what is at stake in the Middle East today. It has the political resources to act. It is the final chance for the Council to decide at last to back the opinion of the European Parliament advocating a suspension of the association agreement with Israel until its forces withdraw from the occupied territories. It is time for the UN to at last oblige the Israeli Government to apply the resolutions it has adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In connection with Israel and the Palestinians, may I ask you to check whether the efforts are being requested from both sides? I have noticed that the Palestinians have been put under extreme pressure. I wonder whether pressure has also been brought to bear on Israel to start leaving the settlements, for that could defuse the situation and could be a clear signal that could take the wind out of the sails of the terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must also exert actual pressure via the Association Agreement. Mr Patten mentioned that better use should be made of the Association Agreement. Does he mean that both the human rights provisions in that Agreement and the origin rules in this accord will be examined? After all, these rules stop privileges from being granted to products that are being exported from the areas of the settlements of Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The peace process is still fragile. It is being ripped to shreds before it has even started. I therefore think that more should be done than is currently the case in order to make actual progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Iran is concerned, following so many debates this week, I should like to ask for it to be ensured that trade and political interests do not take priority over human rights. You mentioned the protocol. I should like to add the human rights aspect, for I do not want women and men from Iran who fight for freedom to be violently oppressed, while we have polite conversations that fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr High Representative, a word about Ituri. It is something but is, I fear, too little. It is also too late, but I support your efforts nevertheless. On behalf of the 50 000 people already killed, I should like to ask you to try to do more. Your current efforts are not enough to protect Ituri as a whole against the violence, and only that can save the peace process in Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To start with, I would like to make a few comments on what I have heard, briefly for I do not have much speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards our European policy, I do not believe that the essential, initial priority for those with a political message is the rebuilding of the PNA. It is important, but it cannot be taken as a basic starting point, or we would be showing bias. We need to combine it with other points. The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority. Secondly, I do not believe – and I am addressing Mr Barón Crespo here – that it should be we who are seeking out the Israelis but, seeing as we are the ones who want to become interlocutors, it has to be we who approach them. Thirdly, I do not believe – and I am addressing Mrs Morgantini here – that it is for us to define rights, when we can see that the law is being ridden roughshod over by people throwing bombs and killing seven-year old children on the other side.</p>
<p class="contents">What I believe we can do as the European Union – and it is important at this time, especially now when Abu Mazen and Ariel Sharon are continuing to talk, although both sides are acting and reacting – is to legitimise the role of Abu Mazen: in this difficult situation, the more legitimacy we give him, the more successful we will be in creating the conditions for relative peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the presence of the Iranian delegation to call upon Iran, precisely because of its long history and its role in the Middle East, to recognise the State of Israel: let it do so, if necessary, through the European Union, but let it recognise the State of Israel. This is important and essential, not least in terms of the recognition of human rights and of economic and, therefore, political development too within Iran. I am sure that this would help to pave the way for a genuine, lasting peace process in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what the Palestinian Islamic terrorist movement, Hamas, has in mind. Peace efforts in the Middle East must concentrate on neutralising enemies of peace, such as Hamas. The Council decisions taken the day before yesterday in Luxembourg constitute a step, albeit a very late step, in the right direction. The European Union would now like to act against the entire Hamas movement, and no longer confine itself to the so-called military wing of Hamas.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly hope that the Member States will be united in adopting a consistent policy against another enemy of peace in the region, the Lebanese Hezbollah, for that ‘Party of Allah’ does not want to resign itself to the existence of a Jewish state either.</p>
<p class="contents">In its meeting in Luxembourg, the Council was right to underline the need for a constructive stance in the fight against terror by the States in the Middle East themselves.

<p class="contents">We must deplore the increasing influence in this respect of the most extreme Palestinian movements, and in particular Hamas. Their contention of the legitimacy of the Israeli State is totally unacceptable. However, should we not begin to ask ourselves whether the increase in the number of attacks aimed at dividing the Palestinians and the refusal to accept once and for all that they deserve an independent State worthy of its name are perhaps the two main factors that are bolstering Hamas today and at the same time weakening the Palestinian Authority as a whole? The financial hunt and the targeted assassinations are certainly not the most effective methods of reducing the extremists’ success. The most effective methods are the political methods. When the Palestinians are offered a credible prospect of a genuine State which, although small, will be a sovereign State and have the necessary territorial continuity for a fully functioning State rather than a pseudo-State or the appearance of a State, that is when the Hamas star will pale once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also one method that we should not ignore or refuse to consider, and that could play an important role in facilitating the separation of the two parties and the resumption of dialogue: the power of interposition. We are well aware that eventually, at the appropriate time of course, the presence on the ground of an outside force of this kind will prove to be essential. Indeed, from a European point of view, this means doing more than remaining a spectator or a commentator at this stage; this is where we could make a useful contribution to the search for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand, Mr High Representative, that you do not approve of this idea initiated by France, but also taken up by the United Nations Secretary-General and others. If that is indeed the case, I am very sorry because I believe that it is an original and useful idea, which we should instead try to share with our partners if we truly want to make our contribution in a way other than by declaiming the resumption of the peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No-one should underestimate the significance of this initiative, at a time when despite the terrible violence on both sides, a rare opportunity for moving forward has now finally presented itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution, whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel’s economy and society caused by the continuing violence, and the impossibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians. Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace. Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arabs that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel’s long-term security is best served via recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own State by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush was understandably reluctant earlier in his presidency to become involved in the minutiae of negotiations which led nowhere and he wisely stood back. He has now taken the right step at the right time to show his personal commitment to a lasting peace. For the first time in many years a solution seems to be in sight. That opportunity must not be wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roadmap is specific on a number of points, not least an immediate cessation of violence on both sides, an initial freezing of settlements and their eventual dismantling, and a willingness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to face up to its historical responsibilities, and rein in the men of violence. Israel, for its part, now that it has accepted the Roadmap, must give Prime Minister Abbas the chance to show his commitment to the peace process. If the Palestinian authorities arrest those who continue to attack Israeli civilians, there will be no need for helicopter gunships to attack Palestinian civilian areas. Nothing would be worse than for this process to be held up because of reprisal killings by the Israeli Government if the Palestinian authority is genuinely committed to peace now. Israel’s agreement today to end the track-and-kill operations of senior political figures from Islamist groups is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the timely decision taken on Monday by the EU Foreign Ministers to issue an ultimatum to Hamas to implement the Roadmap of face serious financial consequences. Already their military wing is a classified terrorist organisation and their despicable and tragic policy of recruiting suicide bombers must be repeatedly and universally condemned by all. Nevertheless, I am pleased that Hamas is now starting new truce talks with Prime Minister Abbas. I agree with Commissioner Patten that the future Palestinian State must be territorially contiguous and viable and not peppered by Israeli settlements, whilst clearly the right of return needs delicate handling. Perhaps a generous financial package of compensation to those who lost property might be the final answer. Imaginative thinking is also needed for the final status of East Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Commissioner Patten personally for his total and transparent collaboration with the working group on scrutiny of EU funds to the Palestinian authority which is now up and running and will reach its conclusion by next year. It is worth noting that, unlike Iraq, the Quartet is an example of how a common European foreign and security policy based on unanimity can actually work. Iraq, by contrast, has shown us that a single, majority voting policy, much less one that could be communitarised, is wholly unrealistic and will result in division and animosity by all parties. In the meantime there is much work for the EU to do to convince both sides of the Arab-Israeli problem that peace is the only real option available in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I felt it would be absurd to do otherwise when the Roadmap is currently the Union’s guiding principle and when the Palestinian Authority – although I do not know how many Palestinians – support this document and the process it sets out.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, I am not convinced at the moment that Ariel Sharon has any great enthusiasm, either for the process or for the document. I say this for the following reason: when the Prime Minister presented the Roadmap to his government, he described it as a ‘necessary evil’ and secured his cabinet’s vote by stating that the 14 reservations or amendments presented to Washington – not to the ‘Quartet’ – are non-negotiable. The Prime Minister made no mention of having to remove settlements, which is crucial if a viable Palestinian State is to be achieved. Furthermore, Prime Minister Sharon declared on 27 May in the Knesset that the settlements would not be discussed in the context of the Roadmap, but bilaterally between Jerusalem and Washington. Israeli television also stated on 10 June that Washington had accepted Israel’s request for matters to proceed in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of these details, I wish to ask the High Representative whether he believes that this information and specifically this bilateral agreement on settlements between Jerusalem and Washington, if confirmed, might constitute a breach of the Roadmap. I should also like to ask the High Representative whether, in his opinion, Israel's 14 reservations or amendments, if accepted, could destroy all prospects for the process and for peace itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It calls, first and foremost, for an end to the conflict, to terrorism, to suicide attacks, to targeted assassinations; it calls for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that two peoples can coexist in peace within secure borders, with the guarantee of democratic institutions. To this end, we believe that the role of the international community is essential to the Roadmap, but we also believe that the European Union must forge itself a stronger, more incisive role in Middle East politics, not in order to set itself up against the United States but precisely so as to stop continually burying its head in the sand and to establish a foreign policy. Basically, that is the challenge facing the Convention, although it is not yet clear how best to tackle it: the challenge of building a political Europe which is able to address at global, at world-wide level the major issues of today – democracy, peace, freedom and development for all peoples, irrespective of race, colour or creed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is a bit late for revenge and, if you think about it, we had our revenge under Alexander the Great.</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply concerned about the European Union's policy towards Iran. I am deeply concerned about the combination of these two decisions taken by the Council on Monday which, on the one hand, raise major questions about the application of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Iran on the basis of its nuclear programme and, on the other hand, announce a general strategy which also ends in the possibility of using violence in the event that the principles governing the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are violated. I think that we are playing with fire. I think that we are laying a huge mine under the very efforts by Iranian students with whom, I think, most members sympathise, with the pretexts we are giving the conservative regime to crush their rebellion. I think that it needs a great deal of care on the part of the Council and on the part of Mr Solana and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I have two questions.

The answer can be boiled down to one sentence: the respect for the rule of international humanitarian law. Any struggle to make Palestinians respect humanitarian law, including those who engage in the criminal act of suicide bombing, will be futile if the State of Israel – the primary party responsible for respecting this rule – repeatedly violates it. It is illegal to build settlements on the occupied territories and demolish houses. It is against humanitarian law to make targeted assassinations accompanied by the killing of innocent civilians, to mention but a few.</p>

How many were not worth the paper they were written on? It is futile to answer this question. It is only now that conditions are in place which, despite everything, do have a prospect of success. This is undoubtedly due to the European Union's efforts and the Roadmap which it produced together with its Quartet partners, the USA, Russia and the United Nations. Of course, there have been plans before, including the Mitchell plan. A Roadmap and a good timetable certainly do not guarantee that we will actually get to where we want to be. There have to be the right actors on both sides, and of course there also has to be pressure from the United States on Israel. While the European Union is important because it also has credibility among the Palestinians – too much, sometimes, for the Israelis – I do feel optimistic, after the meeting between Abu Mazen, Mr Sharon and President Bush, that the new peace initiative can be kept separate from the deadly cycle of violence and reprisals. This is partly to do with the overall political environment in the Middle East. With the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime – whatever you may think of the US intervention – one obstacle has fallen away; the system has been removed, cutting the ground from under the radical Palestinian movements and those who are in favour of extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran too, which has always provided the backing for Hizbollah, should play a constructive role here and think about whether it wants to continue supporting this organisation as it has done until now. There is currently an opportunity to isolate the radical forces and give the moderates a chance. This approach can only work if the European Union and the United States complement each other and do not pursue different strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">While the situation in Iraq is tragic and unsatisfactory, there is also a possibility, for the first time, that Syria and therefore perhaps Lebanon as well will join a peace process with Israel. However, that means that Israel must make sacrifices too. Prime Minister Sharon must not bow to pressure from radical settlers and movements, as this would ensure that Israel could only develop within its biblical borders. The EU must encourage and back him in this as well. Most of the Israeli population is willing to make some sacrifices in order to live in peace and security. However, this also means, of course, that the Palestinian side must abandon its strident demand for refugee return on a one-to-one basis, which would spell the end for the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the European Union be involved with its own peacekeeping troops? This option requires serious thought. I myself find it difficult to foresee any real benefit, firstly because Israel has never entrusted any military force but its own with its security, and secondly because the force could become the target for suicide attacks without being able to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, everything stands or falls by President Bush's determination to help the Palestinians live in their own state. He must show this determination even in an election year. The only way to prevent the Roadmap from trickling into the desert sands is for the European Union and the USA to work together and adopt a unified approach. If they appear to be competitors in the Middle East, this will create a window of opportunity for fresh extremism.</p>

In fact, publication kills implementation. In accordance with this macabre logic, the Quartet’s Roadmap has already been killed on two occasions. The first time was by the proclamation of the 14 reservations, accepted by Washington, of Sharon’s Government. This deprives the various stages of the Roadmap of any substance. But the worst thing is that Sharon wishes to remove all references to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which form the legal basis of any peaceful resolution in the Middle East. If the law is annoying, we should therefore begin by doing away with it. With the war in Iraq, hegemonic power has set an example.</p>
<p class="contents">The second torpedo launched against the implementation of the new peace plan is the shameless return of lex talionis: attacks followed straight away by poorly targeted assassinations. The downward spiral of violence is turning faster and faster. There is thus no opportunity to return to the absolute calm required to get the process up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this regrettable development, the only sensible proposal comes from the United Nations Secretary-General. He recommends sending a force to operate between the two parties. This proposal was immediately rejected by Sharon’s Government as Israel does not have any borders, and as long as Israel does not accept its own borders, there will be absolutely no chance of any peace plan starting or succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this impasse, a simple and clear solution is required, a solution that would instantly put an end to the terrorism: Israel must implement Resolutions 242 and 338, withdraw from the occupied territories and withdraw its troops back to within its internationally recognised borders. The application of international law is a guarantee of immediate success for the Roadmap. The UN, the United States and the European Union have the resources to do this, but they lack the political will and the courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, we – and by that I mean Europe and the USA – must remain faithful to the implementation of the Roadmap. It is as much an American plan as a European one. Indeed, we pressed hard – and I thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for this – for the publication and then for the implementation of this Roadmap. Now, as some speakers have already said, there is a chance of achieving peace only if we both adopt a joint approach. I do not take the view that Europe is acting unilaterally if it puts appropriate pressure on both sides – on Israel and the Palestinians. We need a viable and secure state both for Israel and for Palestine. That needs to be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want violence from the other side – and Mr Nordmann, if I recall the debate in committee, what else is the settlement activity, which is illegal under international law, but violence? The construction of the wall is appalling violence, profoundly affecting people's living conditions and even their lives. Of course, the same applies to the horrifying acts of terrorism, for which I have no sympathies whatsoever. We made it clear to the Iranians with whom we spoke yesterday in particular that any form of sympathy with, or indeed, acceptance of terrorism cannot be tolerated by Europe. Above all, however, terrorism is one thing: it is self-destructive. Any society based on terrorism already bears the taint of violence within itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What we certainly need is support for Palestine's security. The Palestinian Authority will be unable to resolve the security problem on its own. What we also need – and even if the Israelis are opposed to this, we must exert constant pressure to achieve it – are international troops as observers, but also with the option of intervening. We also need Abu Mazen to be successful. The Commissioner takes the view that we need elections, and I think he is right, but elections can only take place usefully once Abu Mazen has had a chance to prove that his course is better and more successful for the Palestinians than the terrorism perpetrated by Hamas and other movements.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days, a young Israeli doctor came to visit me. She spent two years in the military and now she is providing medical care in a mobile clinic in the Palestinian territories. Day after day, this young Israeli goes into the Palestinian territories and helps to ensure that the Palestinians have a modicum of basic healthcare. As long as such people exist in Israel and on the Palestinian side, we must do everything we can to press for peace in the Middle East with hope and confidence.</p>

I am referring to the recent visit to Israel by the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and to the fact that, in ten day’s time, Mr Berlusconi will take on the post of President-in-Office of the Council here in Brussels. I would point out that, after Ariel Sharon had proudly and artfully received him in the one, indivisible capital of the State of Israel, establishing quite a subversive interpretation of the Roadmap, Mr Berlusconi refused in exchange to meet Yasser Arafat and Abu Mazen. On this matter, I agree with the French Foreign Minister, Mr De Villepin, when he said that Mr Berlusconi<span class="bold"> </span>'had not satisfied the European position',<span class="bold"> </span>which is one of wisdom, of dialogue with all. I therefore call upon you, Mr President, to remind Mr Berlusconi, not as Head of the Italian Government but as future President-in-Office of the Council and representative of a European institution, that the duty and objective of the European institutions is not to display or demonstrate friendship to peoples but to pursue a single goal, that of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that I have taken note of them all and we shall try to draw on them in the same spirit as that adopted by most Members who have spoken here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have the same aim – an aim I believe we have shared for a long time and not just as of today – which is to find a formula that will enable us to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions, with the existence of two States that are able to live next to one another in peace and stability, in a region that is stable and in which the two States are recognised by all their neighbours. This is our earnest desire, our dream and what we want to become a reality as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to reply very briefly to the two questions put to me by Mr Menéndez del Valle. In response to the first, I am not aware of any bilateral agreement that addresses the issue of settlements. I am only aware of the ‘Roadmap’ as a whole. Secondly, there can be reservations, on the part of all those involved, provided that all Members of the ‘Quartet’ are willing to implement the Roadmap in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
