<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2002 presented us with another sharp increase in misuses, mismanagement and irregularities in the European Union, with which we had to deal. If we add together the cases reported in the Member States and what OLAF brought to light – some years earlier, it must be admitted – then we are talking about over two billion euros. I cannot recall a time when this sum was as substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that we are talking here about irregularities, and we know that, in the course of further investigations, only a fraction of these irregularities will turn out to be fraud. Speaking as a representative of this House, I want to make it clear that this is where the various analyses that appear in the media do not go far enough. Particularly at the end of a parliamentary term and of a Commission’s term of office, the amount involved is enormous, and cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The increase is particularly marked in the case of the Structural Funds, where the sums reported have trebled – from around EUR 200 million to over EUR 600 million. This is where the question arises of how conscientious Member States are about reporting irregularities. There are still different ways of interpreting things, and disputes as to what is to be reported and how, and it is quite simply incredible how a country like Belgium can report 14 cases to the Commission and Italy 107, while Germany reports nearly 2000 cases. From that we know that there is a massive lack of harmonisation here, and I say this with particular reference to the reform of the structural policies, among others. Those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgetary Control do not do so in order to record the history of our times; what we want is to take the weaknesses of the former policies and develop from them strengths for the future. I can make this claim only in respect of my own share in the work.</p>
<p class="contents">Something similar applies where the recovery of funds is concerned. What is the point, Commissioner, when it comes to fraud prevention, if one has to wait almost decades before the money is returned? One particular Member State, Italy, has been waiting for recovery for many years already. That is an open secret, as is the fact that it is being used as an instrument of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area is that of agriculture. Our Committee has for a long time sought to get the Commission and the Member States, once and for all, to do away with export refunds and, most of all, with those paid for the unspeakable, because pain-filled, unethical and cruel transport of live cattle. It defies comprehension how, in 2002, of some 262 000 live cattle, the export of which cost us some EUR 62 million of tax revenue, 226 000 could be delivered to a small country like Lebanon. We have indications, which we have to take seriously, that Lebanon does not by any means possess the capacity to absorb, consume, slaughter or process this number of animals itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we can remember the case, not so long ago, when a sudden increase in meat exports to Jordan was eventually explained as the circumvention of UN sanctions against Iraq. I cannot therefore understand why the Commission is again, ostrich-fashion, burying its head in the sand and pleading ignorance. We call for OLAF to get involved in this. I am not talking about prevention; I am just waiting for the first animal rights activists to accompany these exports and for us to see the first pictures in the media. This is what European taxpayers’ money is being used for.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third point I would like to mention: a few days ago, we heard of the unprecedented raid on a journalist’s home, not – contrary to what we have read today – in connection with anything that happens here in this House, but in connection with the case of Paul van Buitenen. We would like to raise the issue of how OLAF has handled this case. We well remember the reprimand given to OLAF in connection with this by the European Ombudsman. We recall how OLAF’s investigations can commence only where there is well-founded suspicion and that they must be of appropriate duration – in other words, they must not be artificially extended. We would ask the OLAF Supervisory Committee to state whether, in this instance, these rules have been broken and whether or not this investigation has been misused for the purpose of putting journalists under pressure or of intimidating them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kendall, the chairman of the Supervisory Committee, has informed me that this will be an item on the agenda of the Committee’s next meeting, in April, and has also confirmed to me that OLAF did not seek the Committee’s opinion before calling in the Belgian justice authorities. One member of the Committee, Mr Noack, told the press that, if the Committee’s inquiries led it to the conclusion that OLAF’s actions were unacceptable, then the dismissal of its Director-General was not to be excluded as a possibility. Let me stress at this point how important the Supervisory Committee’s report on this matter will be to us. This is the test case for whether the monitoring of OLAF works or not and for whether or not the necessary action is taken when things get out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I can do no other than warn those in positions of responsibility within OLAF against hiding themselves behind Belgian justice. There must be no exceptions: everything that OLAF has done in this matter so far, everything that has been passed on to the judicial authorities, must be submitted to the Supervisory Committee. We need this matter to be clarified, and soon; not in months, but in a few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Bösch, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset, it was a matter of fundamental concern to the Commission under President Prodi that the administration of Europe’s finances should undergo extensive reform and that they should be protected against fraud. The decisive action we have taken has achieved a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">In carrying out our reforms, we have been guided by the report produced by the Group of Wise Men, which your House appointed at the end of the previous Commission’s term of office. The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central. It is those who administer Europe’s funds who bear full responsibility for the proper handling of them. Centralised financial control has been done away with, a course of action that was long overdue. The division between financial control and policy management was a relic of a time when Europe still had a very small budget. Now, at last, we have the sort of structure that is taken for granted in the Member States, with individual ministries being responsible for the proper spending of their budgets. What happened in Eurostat during the nineties, with accounts being set up and administered outside the Budget, forcefully reminded everyone of the old system’s deficiencies. The Commission has, however, retained a central internal audit office, the importance of which was underlined when, as long ago as the summer of the year 2000, it was placed under the Vice-President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF was established as an important and new anti-fraud body, intended to be fully independent in uncovering, by way of administrative investigations, fraud and irregularities within the institutions and in the external sphere. Where will you find the like of it in the Member States? In this, the European Union is ahead of the field, and it is of course encouraging that some of the new Member States are taking OLAF’s structure as a model.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as establishing and extending OLAF, the Commission has introduced a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to combating fraud; we have promoted the development of a culture of prevention not only by faultproofing legislation, but also by drawing up ethical standards for the Commission’s staff and detailed provisions to protect whistle-blowers. In combating fraud, we have stepped up operational cooperation with the Member States. What makes this essential is the fact that it is the Member States who administer some 80% of the expenditure from the Community budget. In this respect, OLAF is developing a true platform of services for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The anti-fraud report for 2002 – which is what we are discussing today – shows that the Member States have made greater efforts to safeguard the EU’s finances than they did in the past. It was in 2002 that the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests at last entered into force. Even so, as Mr Bösch’s report shows, there is still more to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">As one would expect of him, Mr Bösch has produced a comprehensive report dealing with a whole range of issues related to fraud prevention, and from various angles. I would like to turn my attention to one aspect to which you, Mr Bösch, have just referred, and that is the issue of export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true to say that export refunds demand a high degree of vigilance, as it always involves more than one country, so it follows that this is an area in which monitoring must always be very consistent. According to the Directorate-General of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, though, the high volume of live cattle exported to Lebanon is also attributable to the steps that the European Union has taken to monitor the exports of live cattle in general. At the beginning of this decade, the main players left in this field were Lebanon and Egypt. During the BSE crisis, Egypt stopped importing live cattle from the European Union and instead started importing them from Australia. This explains the current high volume exported to Lebanon. I did of course ask whether the number of cattle exported there bore any relation to Lebanese consumer habits, and the DG Agriculture Policy again confirmed that these figures had of course to be considered in the light of the fact that the Lebanese eat practically no pigmeat and so it was only natural that more beef should be consumed than other varieties of meat.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to assure you, though, that I fully share your particular concerns about the protection of animals. In 2003, the Commission enacted new regulations on the export of live animals and tightened up those already in force. Today, the DG Agriculture has again confirmed to me that very tight controls are carried out both in the countries of origin and in the countries to which they are exported.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that Mr Bösch’s report, as is usual, takes a highly critical line, and so we are all the more pleased that the report expresses appreciation for the actions taken by the Commission. This is not the only reason for the Commission to be grateful to the rapporteur; on the contrary, many of the steps taken by the Commission in recent years to combat fraud originated in demands and suggestions made, in particular, by the Committee for Budgetary Control. The improvements and reforms at OLAF are among them. Here too, it was the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, who was particularly insistent on changes being made.</p>
<p class="contents">We now propose to amend the OLAF Regulation by improving the flow of information between OLAF and the Commission, by providing better procedural safeguards for those under investigation, and by giving a greater role to OLAF’s Supervisory Committee, to certain of whose functions you have just, again, referred. Alongside this, communications within the Commission on the subject of suspected fraud have been improved, notably between the political level and the services. These, too, had been brought to our attention by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We – and by ‘we’ I mean Parliament too – have achieved a fundamental reform of the Financial Regulation. The new Financial Regulation not only reinforces budgetary principles, but also contains important instruments for combating fraud, and for exclusion of parties from tenders where details given by them are false. Very recently, <span class="italic">Transparency International</span> has described this as exemplary. Administrative reform is largely complete. We have, in the shape of OLAF, an effective and powerful instrument for combating fraud, but we must, of course, be constantly working to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">What we still need to do, though, is to set up a European Public Prosecutor’s Office; fraud that is detrimental to the European Budget must be punishable under criminal law. The Committee on Budgetary Control – particularly its chairman and the rapporteur, Mr Bösch – have been arguing in favour of this for years. Recently, we have joined together in campaigning – and very successfully too – for the Convention to incorporate in the draft Constitution the proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office to protect our financial interests. It is, fortunately, probable that an Intergovernmental Conference will, before the end of the Irish presidency’s six months, adopt a resolution on the draft Constitution. I would reiterate, though, that we have not yet got over all the hurdles, and I see it as absolutely necessary that all those who have worked towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, should continue to be vigilant, lest it fall victim to some compromise or other. Right up to the Intergovernmental Conference, which will be in June, we will need to keep a very watchful eye on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be interesting, but there is nothing new about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It all adds up to a sorry story, Commissioner, and you cannot put a positive spin on it. It could be said that fraud is continuing regardless. A 36% rate of increase may well be desirable in other areas, but it is nothing more or less than a disaster in the anti-fraud field. It actually reveals that you have nothing to show for the four and a half years that you have served as a Commissioner. Let us remind ourselves how the Prodi Commission took office in the autumn of 1999 grandiosely committing itself to, and demanding, zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities. Everything was to be different after the fall of the Santer Commission – and what happened? One might say that one scandal gave way to another. Let me remind you of the way you froze out the chief accountant after she said that the whole reform was not going as smoothly as you had told the outside world it was. You changed the Financial Regulation, but without, in my view, making it more transparent or any clearer; instead, you did it by way of a jungle of regulations that nobody, at the end of the day, knows their way around. Indeed, your cardinal error, in my view, was to do away with the independent position of Financial Controller, and to replace it with an internal audit service, one that is neither independent nor – it would appear – very appealing, in view of the fact that you will, in April, be losing its director, who is also making good his escape. An accounting system has come to light that is described quite rightly in the press as being ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’ and ‘as open as a bank vault’.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have the Eurostat affair, with its secret accounts and losses acknowledged as totalling at least EUR 8 million. I do not mean it as praise, Commissioner, when I call that a fantastic result; only a cynic could congratulate you on it. As always, though, you are unaware of any wrongdoing. All the Commissioners responsible are simply wriggling out of it and hiding themselves in the regulatory jungle that they themselves have created. That none of this encourages any confidence on the part of the European public is evidently a matter of no concern to you; it would appear that the prevalent attitude is still that one can be more free and easy with Europe’s money than with that of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be noted that this scandal is only the latest in a long line of scandals. Commissioner, you have mentioned here the reports provided by your colleague Commissioner Fischler on this matter. I would, perhaps, ask you to take a look at the 2001 press in order to see, in great detail, the whole scandal of the export refunds for Jordan – which had also taken place as regards other countries – with the sole purpose of breaching UN sanctions on Iraq. This has gone on for a number of years, involving various countries, and if the Commission has been unable to see what has been happening, I honestly think that this is because it did not wish to understand. After all, detailed reports have even appeared in the press.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say, however, is that we are not only dealing with the scandal of breaking the Iraq embargo with EU funds. This is one of many, such as the scandal of the holding group set up by the Naples Camorra – involving large dairy companies from France, Belgium and Germany – to adulterate butter with beef tallow and oils. This was also heavily financed by the Community budget, with export subsidies and disposal subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that Commissioner Fischler, whose name has not been mentioned here – though his name ought to be the first to come up in these circumstances – cannot ignore the scale of these successive scandals concerning the agriculture budget. We have yet to receive any clarification whatsoever of the amount of money spent by the Community budget on disposing butter adulterated by this Camorra holding group between 1995 and 2000, and there has been a similar silence concerning the amount of money recovered. We still do not know which companies were involved, nor why the Commission has not imposed any sanction against any of them, not even sanctions relating to the functioning of milk quota mechanisms. We must discover why it is that the Commission treats the major agriculture and food companies with such indulgence and impunity, yet imposes harsh penalties on small-scale farmers or dairies for the slightest administrative lapse. These are the important questions that require answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) was set up under great pressure from Parliament to replace the former UCLAF. Its task obviously has to be clarified, but at the same time we must ensure that the European Union does not start to become a Community reminiscent of a police state. At this stage our group does not support point 39, which goes too far in its outline of OLAF’s future role. We still wish to keep our options open, and for that reason we have drafted Amendment No 8. This gives attention to the following: the competence of the OLAF Supervisory Committee in relation to the Director’s discretionary powers, the matter of where the secretariat is to be physically located, and the rights of the people whose actions OLAF is investigating. We should remember that it would be a very alarming situation if OLAF were to investigate an unfounded report.</p>
<p class="contents">As points 1 and 2 imply that poor administration and fraud are due to the fact that the same Commissioner is responsible for both the budget and financial control, we cannot accept this conclusion, which oversimplifies the matter. At the same time we do not wish to belittle the determination and firmness with which the Commission has pushed for administrative reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

OLAF’s breaking into a journalist’s house and seizing computers, notes, address registers and mobile telephones constitutes a very serious encroachment upon the freedom of the press. Following the raid, the Belgian police did not actually bring any specific charges. I therefore sincerely hope that OLAF has a very good explanation of why this course of action was taken. An explanation really is needed. If OLAF cannot provide such an explanation, I do not believe that OLAF’s director can remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the European Commission whether it knew about this in advance and, if so, who in the Commission was aware of the matter. Please answer this question here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF has faced a lot of criticism in the wake of the Eurostat scandal. I think that this has, in the main, been justified. OLAF’s director chose not to inform the Commission in time. Obviously, there need to be fundamental reforms to the way in which information is passed on, something that is now in part also being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s report is a very thorough piece of work, and makes for fairly gloomy reading. It is a kind of balancing of the books following five years’ work since the Santer Commission was forced to go. What is evident is that the problems involving fraud and irregularities have not disappeared. The problems have even increased in the last year. What is also evident is the fact that the promises previously made to demand political accountability have not been fulfilled, above all where the Eurostat scandal is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem does not only relate to control systems. It is also about system errors. A matter such as export refunds for live animals is an invitation to fraud. It also involves systematically organised cruelty to animals, funded by the taxpayers. The existence of such systems is in fact an invitation to misuse tax revenue in the European Union. In this case, increased control is not what is in the first place required. What is required is for the system to be done away with as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards export refunds, a report is coming up in Parliament this week about the conditions under which animals can be transported. Export refunds should be abolished. Clearly the vast majority of European Union citizens do not approve of the idea that their money is being used to subsidise a trade which causes untold suffering to animals, regardless of how high standards are or how good the conditions are. It is undeniable that animals are being subjected to unnecessary suffering. To cap it all, European taxpayers are being forced to subsidise this. The time has come for us to end export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a huge budget here which is wide open to abuse. Looking at this recent case I believe it should be fully investigated by OLAF. Regardless of whether we agree with export refunds or not – and I clearly do not – we need a full investigation as a result of recent reports regarding animals being transported to the Lebanon. What was their final destination?</p>
<p class="contents">In general, export refunds are completely unjustifiable. I do not believe that European taxpayers' money should go towards this kind of trade. If export refunds were abolished, that would solve the whole problem. There would be no more scandals in relation to abuse of taxpayers' money, but we need a full report on what has been mentioned in the media recently in relation to the scandals and the fraud involved. Commissioner, you should ensure that investigation takes place. It is essential that we have a commitment as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the 2002 annual report, it appears that the number of reported cases of fraud has risen dramatically. Although this is, in itself, not such a good thing, this rise does mean that more attention is being paid to the fight against fraud and irregularities. More attention is a good thing, but it should also be translated into both punitive and preventive action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has some catching up to do where the improvement of direct management is concerned. A separate directorate general for financial control should be set up, independent of the present DG for the Budget. As long as those in charge intend to keep a grip on their inspectors, there is no room for a transparent climate, in which people accept responsibility and hold others to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is concerned that amendments have been tabled to delete paragraphs 1 and 2 from the resolution. Has this Parliament perhaps been created with a view to taking the Commission under its wing – even when it makes mistakes or remains in default? An uncritical attitude of this kind instils distrust in the voter, and rightly so, because this Parliament primarily has a monitoring task, which it has to carry out meticulously by fighting irregularities and fraud, also in its own House, in a consistent manner. That is a first measure in order to increase the structurally low turnout in European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the inadequate recovery of excessive or incorrect amounts paid. Has a consistent register been finally set up in the accounting system? Why is the Commission only claiming back a small proportion? How do you explain this to the citizens in the Member States? Is it in their interest that you recover so little? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Bösch report contains a veritable litany of the failings of the Commission either to create an accounting system even approaching adequacy or to tackle the fraud that is inherent in everything the EU does. He quotes a colossal EUR 2.12 billion – or, in real money, something like GBP 1.5 billion – as the total amount of fraud listed in the Commission's annual report for 2002. From training seminars for senior civil servants that were never held, to mass defrauding of the CAP, this eye-opening record of failure is there for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The report notes that, incredibly, in 50% of the cases of agricultural fraud, it was impossible to identify the products concerned. Under these circumstances, I also share the report's concern at the shortcomings of the work of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Bösch report provides a list of blindingly obvious things that could and should have been done many years ago to make this leaking ship more sound. It is self-evident that a leaking ship will continue to leak and, indeed, eventually sink if it takes on new passengers. As the accession countries join the EU on 1 May, I put it to you that the EU's finances are in a huge mess and that the addition of ten new countries will simply make that mess even bigger and may well cause the ship to founder.</p>
<p class="contents">This report very effectively demonstrates the failure of a European Union that is hopelessly mired in fraud and corruption and lacks the will to do anything about it. Any nation that continues to plough money into this black morass is very badly letting down the taxpayers who foot the bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fellow-Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement has asked me to make this point clear.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I would like to do is to respond to the questions that Mrs Stauner raised, and the statements she made, about the claim that EUR 1.8 billion went missing in 2002. One simply cannot come to that conclusion on the basis of the figures in the report on the implementation of Article 280; the Member States are obliged to report any irregularities relating to the Structural Funds, the Agricultural Funds, or the own resources. Irregularities are taken to mean infringements of European regulations. Such an irregularity can be of a financial nature, but it can also be, for example, a breach of an environmental regulation, in which case no financial loss whatever is incurred. As these reports have to relate to the project in its entirety, it is impossible to conclude that the whole project is in some way tantamount to fraud. If, though, a financial irregularity has occurred, the money must be recovered, and it is the Member States themselves who must produce it. It follows that, at the very least, the funds reclaimed must be deducted from the sums to which you, Mrs Stauner, have referred.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course quite illusory to believe that you can have a budget made up of subsidies without any fraud whatever; the risk of fraud is inherent in it. This makes rigorous and universal controls all the more necessary, and in some areas it is the Member States that have to carry these out. Of course it is vexatious when reports either arrive late or are incomplete. You are quite right to say, Mr Bösch, that if there is a country somewhere that has had nothing to report, that does not indicate that everything is being done properly there, but rather that checks are not being carried out. Even in Member States that perhaps pride themselves on doing a good job of monitoring, we find, again and again, that they are not.</p>
<p class="contents">Take a look at the Court of Auditors’ report for the year 2000. It shows, unfortunately, that it is in the country from which you and I come, the country we both know best, that paying agencies – including one in Bavaria, your own part of the country – have the highest margin of error. For that reason, offices everywhere must carry out checks, and as and when they find something, they have to take appropriate action – which may involve recovering the money. In that event, we have to be consistent, and the money must be collected. I have to tell Mrs Stauner that ‘zero tolerance’ does not mean that we stop carrying out checks, but that, if something is found, we draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, by way of a brief response to what Mr van Dam said, to point out that the DG Budget is not the DG with responsibility for financial control. I will reiterate that point. Financial control has now been decentralised, and the position is the same in all the countries from which you come, where it is always the ministry responsible for a particular programme that is also responsible for monitoring it and for its proper implementation; it cannot hide behind another Directorate-General. That was our mistake in the past. The internal audit service is independent, something that I believe it did indeed demonstrate while Mr Muis was responsible for running it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to the issue of the transport of live animals, export subsidies and the export of live cattle. The fact of the matter is that this is permitted. It is also stated, in a Council decision, that live exports are subsidised, albeit to a lesser extent than in the past, so I cannot categorise the export of live cattle as fraud; it is legal. I share your concern that questions should be asked about precisely what, in terms of animal protection, is ethically justifiable about this. I did mention that – as we saw in the case of Egypt – the Commission has tightened up the relevant regulations. If, then, the European Union stops these exports, and these animals are transported from Australia, then, as far as the protection of animals is concerned, nothing has been gained. This means that it is vital that we act in the interests of the welfare of animals not merely within the EU, but also seek out allies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of your critical comments in this area and will be passing them on to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler. I will be asking him to make available to you any further information you may wish to have. In any case, I will tell him about the critical tone your House has adopted on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
