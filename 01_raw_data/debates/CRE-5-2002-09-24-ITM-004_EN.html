<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to Rule 9(1) of our Rules of Procedure, I must first inform you that I am a farmer and as such I hold a direct interest in every aspect of the Agricultural Fund, such as this proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory scrutinies for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget, for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes. We have nothing against reducing this number, since the quality, the Community character, the selection process and the transparency of this process are, of course, significantly improved. We have been extremely concerned to see the high level of fraud and irregularities that beset operations whose control is covered by this regulation, specifically livestock exports and subsidies for the disposal of milk products and we have expressed this view on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">As seen in the European butter falsification case, fraud against the financial interests of the Community is indissociable from fraud against the financial interest of the Member States, against public health and against farmers, in whose name these considerable amounts of Community monies are spent, but who are often harmed by them. According to information published recently in the press, the number of seizures by Members States’ customs services of falsified food products rose from 2 340 in 2000, to 4 106 in 2001 and Commission administrators have stated that organised crime is today focusing more on falsifying food products than on falsifying luxury articles.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also receiving news of glaring shortcomings in the fight being waged by the Member States against food falsification, specifically in key fields such as wine, oil, and meat and milk products. Given these circumstances, we again insist, as we have done over the last three years, on the Commission’s significantly increasing its direct action to monitor fraud and falsification in the food trade and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome, of course, the proposals to reform the CAP, which call into question the continuity of these intervention mechanisms, which have proven to be open invitations to fraud and falsification, being of dubious effectiveness in supporting farmers’ incomes, opting instead for direct aid granted according to the area farmed and to the rural work undertaken, using criteria of sustainable development. There cannot, of course, be effective control without transparent procedures and without democratic scrutiny by Parliament. A few years after the scandal broke of the more than 35 thousand tonnes of butter falsified by the Camorra and disposed of in Europe and beyond by milk product companies from various Europeans countries, we have still not been told which companies were involved and what measures have been adopted against them by the European Institutions, and to prevent this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">When will this matter be finally cleared up? What progress has been made on physical scrutinies of these high-risk products that allow us reasonably to expect that we will see no further occurrences of scandals of this scale? I must highlight once again that the idea that only the falsification of milk products directly subsidised by Community funds can be considered to affect the financial interests of the Community is unacceptable. If this approach is accepted, whereas farmers that exceed their production quota for cow’s milk, respecting the financial interests of the Community, are heavily penalised, industrial concerns that sell milk products that are not made with milk would not be penalised, despite having a much more damaging effect on the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important, where this regulation is concerned, to disseminate the list of commercial and industrial undertakings and the amounts with which they are subsidised by the Agricultural Fund to dispose of surpluses. I fail to understand why any competition process to adjudicate a commercial bid for tender or even to award a scientific grant has to be public, divulging the sums and the actors involved, but when we are talking about multinationals that receive sometimes enormous sums to get rid of food products, the public does not have the right to know who is receiving funds and to what ends. Democratising Europe and increasing the confidence of the citizens in their institutions inevitably require a more transparent attitude and equitable procedures. We hope that due account is taken of this regulatory amendment by both the Council and the Commission because it presents a unique opportunity to overcome the obvious shortcomings in this field of protecting the Community’s financial interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should underline that the implementation by the Member States of Regulation 4045/89 is generally satisfactory. The Commission's proposal therefore only contains technical amendments aimed at adjusting reference amounts for inflation, as was the case with the last amendment in 1994, simplifying Member States' reporting requirements and including the possibility of reducing the number of scrutinies in certain duly motivated cases. These would be cases in which control services from more than one Member State joined forces in scrutinising international-scale companies receiving EAGGF aid. As I have said, the implementation by the Member States of the obligations arising from this control regulation is satisfactory, but some technical amendments are called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress one important factor: the regulation is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation. The Commission therefore shares the opinion of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that Article 37 and not Article 280 is the most appropriate legal base. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal is one that I am able to welcome in its entirety, as it aims to improve the combating of fraud in the area of agriculture. For there is one thing that must be clear to all of us, and that is that fraud harms farmers themselves. The EAGGF guarantee is a means of financing, for example, export refunds, interventions by the various market organisations or the co-financing of supporting and other measures for the development of rural areas outside the Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has already pointed out, Regulation 4045/89 deals with retrospective checking of the business records of undertakings in receipt of agricultural aid from the Community budget for EAGGF guarantees. Thus, this Regulation is the core anti-fraud measure in the agricultural sphere. I welcome the Commission's presentation of proposals for adapting this instrument and bringing it up to date. Controls are important, especially in agriculture, which is a sensitive area, because the whole industry would suffer without them.</p>
<p class="contents">The selection criteria for the undertakings to be audited were last amended in 1994, but have not been further adapted since then. To take an example, the annual rate of inflation has to be taken into account. Use of risk analysis techniques is to be even further improved. Aid payments already received, which are fixed as the threshold at which scrutiny starts, are to be raised, and administrative assistance has to be simplified. This makes me very thankful that this will take place across all the Member States, as this will enable us to reduce the number of audits by up to 25%, which must in no way be taken as a reduction in their quality, but a more targeted selection of undertakings to be audited, and one that relates more to the risks involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Fraud needs to be combated in a hard-hitting and focussed way. In future, therefore, electronic data and documents will be subjected to scrutiny, yielding data on production and on the type of produce. Direct payments to the producer will continue to be excluded from scrutiny, as will those payments covered by the integrated administration and control system. I would like to conclude with particular reference to the real importance of taking into account the need to create special framework conditions, based on a multi-annual approach, for this in controls and measures or rural development projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is very timely, and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone, because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection. However, that does not mean in any way actively encouraging lesser controls. I happen to believe that if you are going to have real control of the finances of the European Union, it can only be best carried out at Member State level, because the Member States also have the ability to follow such controls through.</p>
<p class="contents">I would agree totally with the previous speaker, that the vast majority of people in the agricultural industry, be they in the manufacturing side, the factory side or indeed at the farm level, are not involved in fraud. There will, however, always be a small number of people in any country who are prepared to abuse a system. I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do, we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect, because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely, and could be much better spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the threshold is to be increased. I think it is timely and I return to my point – I still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the Member States and that we in Europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, I repeat, wants to encourage fraud; certainly we in this Parliament would not in any way want to encourage fraudulent acts and where they are found they must be dealt with very severely. So, we must have good control but it must be targeted, it must be specific, it must be to the point, and it must be in areas where abuse has been found. I certainly believe we can improve the situation, I believe this can be achieved, and I believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to your institution's information, losses of EUR 430 million were sustained in this area last year, which means that it is not we who suffered, but those sitting up there – the taxpayers of this European Union of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about how we should reform agricultural policy in Europe, as the Commission recently proposed, in order thereby to bring agricultural policy closer to the public, and in this case, closer to the taxpayers – something to which Mrs Schierhuber, a farmer herself, referred, and on which point I wish to give her my support – we have to distance ourselves from such quibbles about what is control, and what is directed against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore my view that the Commission would have been well-advised to follow our thinking, which is that of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and, in the final analysis, give these measures the legal basis of the protection of the Community's financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already given some thought to how we could put a stop to export refunds, especially in the area of live cattle exports. The images we see of Mediterranean harbours, which our young people get to see, are far from being an advertisement for this agricultural policy and far from being an advertisement for the European Union. That is something we have to do away with, and there have been amendments on the subject tabled by this House in this Budget. Let me say loud and clear that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission has given us no support. The amendments will be back, and we can then expect more cooperation in the future, for, in this Parliament, which makes it its business to monitor the budget, we are well aware that this system of export refunds cannot be made immune to fraud. On the contrary, such a thing is impossible. The system of agricultural export refunds as currently practised is an invitation to fraud. That is a challenge, and I see the debate on the choice between Article 37 or Article 280 from the Treaties as purely academic. Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, we, who talk more to the people who live alongside us, eat and drink with us and pay us taxes, cannot afford that for the future. Here the wholehearted support for our rapporteur and for his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate Mr Casaca on behalf of my group. I share his relentless ambition to improve agricultural controls. If this policy is already controversial, and European agricultural policy is controversial, then we must in any event ensure that the money is well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the essence of the Commission's proposal? It aims to reduce the number of controls, but to improve them at the same time. We hope that the latter is the case, but everything is yet to be proven, of course. We will be closely monitoring this process, something that I support. The proof will be in the pudding. You will be given the benefit of the doubt, but I hope that your premises are indeed genuine.</p>
<p class="contents">Something which Parliament has always asked for are margins of error for the individual sectors of the budget, and this also applies to the agricultural budget.</p>
<p class="contents">How great is the margin of error in the dairy sector, for example? How much is it in the cereal sector, or the tobacco sector?</p>
<p class="contents">The big question is whether you are able to supply these figures by means of this other system, because based on the Commission's new system of accounting, we expect that these figures will be available in due course. The Court of Auditors has said that it will not be able to do this. We would therefore ask the Commission to indicate, more or less on an annual basis, what the estimated margin of error and the estimated improvement will be. This will enable us to assess improvements in the Commission’s control procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">One subject that has not been touched upon, not even in the Commission proposal, is that we have noticed an increasing emphasis on rural policy in Commissioner Fischler's proposals. Funding for rural policy is subject to good agricultural practices, which is excellent, and we must incorporate the environment and similar issues in this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what exactly are good agricultural practices? My guess is that good agricultural practices in Sweden may on the whole be different from good agricultural practices in the Netherlands, or Portugal, or Greece, or wherever. This is the essence. What is considered normal in one country is still not normal in another country.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment concerns Amendment No 10 pertaining to the publication of all data on the various destinations of agricultural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with this in principle, but as far as I know, this does not apply to any of the other subsections of the budget. This is why we will be keeping our powder dry for the time being and will not be voting for this amendment at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Hulten (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, like my colleagues, I endorse the Commission proposal that has been tightened up by Mr Casaca. As we have grown accustomed from Mr Casaca, it is a very sound report with good recommendations, and I regret that the Commission is unable to indicate that it will be adopting all of Mr Casaca's proposals, certainly in the light of the wide support which these proposals are enjoying from the Committee on Budgetary Control. One of the aspects involved is the legal basis of this proposal. As is generally known, we take the view that this should be Article 280 because it is essentially about the good management of EU funding. This is not about giving in to the agricultural lobby for the umpteenth time. In a way, the agricultural subsidies are, in fact, the EU's best kept secret. We know that a great deal goes wrong. Only last week, it transpired from the Court of Auditors' report that subsidies for oilseeds are being misused on a large scale, and yet, little seems to be done about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that we should make these flows of funds transparent. Indeed, not a great deal of aid lands with the small farmers for whom it is intended, but ends up instead with large multinationals, as Mr Casaca has already explained. Yet, it is not possible to make this data public. The VVD and CDA in the Liberal and Christian-Democratic groups – that are, incidentally well represented in this debate today – are opposed to making these public. Why? Fear of public access? Mrs Maij-Weggen was this Parliament's rapporteur who spoke in favour of public access to documents. The Liberal group has always set great store by public access. So that cannot be the stumbling block. Could other elements be at play, such as self-interest and looking after the group's supporters? Or a reluctance to make the flows of funds transparent because that would clearly demonstrate the need for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy? I am afraid that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that Mr Mulder is unable to support Amendment No 10 by Mr Casaca about making the flow of funds known, giving the excuse – for it is nothing but an excuse – that anything that does not apply to other areas of policy should not apply to agriculture either. Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument. He has done this for the past couple of years, and this is not the way forward, certainly not given the fact that the agricultural budget accounts for half of the European budget. This problem will become more pressing following enlargement. Even more businesses will join, and it is then even more important that we know where the money ends up.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy has taken on undesirable forms over the past few years. Subsidies do not end up with those for whom they are intended. An example of this, which was quoted only this summer, is the fact that even the Dutch Queen receives subsidies for creating an olive tree plantation in Italy. If there is somebody in Europe who does not need this money, then surely it is one of the world's richest women. And this is going on while rural policy in Groningen in the Netherlands, for example, has insufficient funding to help small farmers keep their heads above water.</p>
<p class="contents">This proves that this policy has got out of hand and that we must inject transparency into the flow of funding. This could, in turn, serve as a basis for a thorough reform even before the new Member States join. For this is desperately needed. Mr Casaca's report is a first step in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, like the rapporteur, acknowledge that the Commission proposal is acceptable, because it undoubtedly represents a significant increase in the quality of Community controls and procedures and demonstrates that the Commission is already committed to this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The monitoring of expenditure and of all Community funding procedures is indissolubly linked to greater transparency and equity. It is, therefore, in these fields that the Commission and Parliament must focus their main concerns. We are all aware of the quantity and the scale of fraud that has been perpetrated – despite the existing monitoring system – and therefore nothing that we can do to improve the system will be cost-free or dispensable. The Commission in particular and the European Union in general can only gain by disseminating all available information to the citizens and primarily by the public’s understanding of the relationship between the main beneficiaries of common funding policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to seeing whether the promises made by the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in this field can be fulfilled in the short term. I also wish to endorse the rapporteur's proposal aiming to change the legal basis from Article 37 to Article 280 of the Treaty. This would be a major change, of great significance, which would attach the utmost priority to protecting the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, finally, to remind you that fairness in international trade is an incalculable asset in the medium term and, above all, that there are no isolated or unconnected economic sectors. The potential harm to third countries arising from protectionist policies or the absence of transparency in procedures or in the implementation of rules will eventually be suffered by those who make this form of behaviour the norm for intervention. It is absolutely crucial that the proclaimed reform of the CAP can incorporate these and other principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to thank all my fellow Members who have been kind enough to refer to the work that we have produced in this field and I should like to say that, on this matter, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, in fact, worked extremely well. We have all shared the same vision, which essentially we all hold with regard to the need to protect our financial interests, and we have produced a piece of work that is essentially collective.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I should also like to thank the Commissioner for the attention that she has paid to this report, but I must say, Commissioner, that your intervention raised some questions that I think are absolutely crucial to clarify. And, with the permission of the President, I should like to ask you four very specific questions highlighted by this report:</p>
<p class="contents">- Firstly, the Commissioner tells us that Article 280 only concerns fraud and that this regulation is about scrutiny. Commissioner, this is not the first time that I have heard the Commission say this, but I am tempted to say that perhaps the Commission needs to take a closer look at Article 280. Because, and to translate freely from the English version, the first paragraph of this very Article states that ‘the Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community’. It is quite clear, therefore, from the wording of Article 280 that we are not only dealing with fraud but with all and any illegal activity that threatens the financial interests of the Community. It is, therefore, perfectly clear that this regulation falls entirely within the scope of this protection, and I must say that the overwhelming majority of processes to recover money undertaken by the Community are done carried out under this regulation. I would say that perhaps around three-quarters of these processes and three-quarters of the appropriations recovered fall under this regulation. How, then, can the Commission say something like this – that this has nothing to do with Article 280, when this regulation is a straightforward transcription of what is laid down in Article 280?</p>
<p class="contents">- Secondly, the Commissioner says that the performance of this regulation has been satisfactory. As has already been said, I do not believe we can look at this regulation in isolation from the other regulations and from the entire legal structure intended to protect the financial interests of the Community. From this point of view, I only wish to point out once again the scandal that I have already mentioned; the scandal of the butter falsified by the Camorra of Naples and which had the cooperation of major European milk-product undertakings in almost all large European countries. This is a scandal that started in 1995, that involved at least 35 thousand tonnes of falsified butter, and which was only stopped in the year 2000, in other words, 35 thousand tonnes of butter were falsified over five years, involving large undertakings in France, Germany, Belgium and probably in other countries. And not once did this regulation enable the Commission to understand the first thing about this falsification of butter. A local investigation had to be conducted by the Italian police in Naples for this scandal to start to be unravelled. We are now in 2002, and we still do not know which undertakings are involved and what the Commission intends to do to these undertakings. And the Commissioner thinks that this is satisfactory. Please forgive me for saying so, but this is not satisfactory. I do not think it is satisfactory that food falsification has almost doubled between the year 2000 and 2001, which is, for example, another figure that has appeared in the press and which has not, so far, been denied by the Commission. This, as far as I am concerned, is not satisfactory;</p>
<p class="contents">- Thirdly, Commissioner, we have the issue of transparency. I have heard the Commissioner call for transparency – and rightly so – in the most varied circumstances. In these circumstances, however, I do not understand why it is that when we reach this point, the Commission and, therefore, also the Commissioner, are no longer calling for transparency. How is it possible that we can go onto the Internet and see who is applying for grants funded by the Community science Programme, for example, and who has received these grants, but we cannot find out which multinationals receive millions and millions of euros to export European food surpluses or to dispose of them on the internal market? Why is this a State secret? Why is the Commission not telling us which undertakings these are? How much are they receiving? For what purpose? What aspect of this needs to remain secret? And here, as our fellow Members have already said, and quite rightly so, our problem is not just with the Commission, but also with our fellow Members from the PPE and the Liberals, who have also hitherto refused to accept that this rule, which I believe is fundamentally transparent, is included in the regulation;</p>
<p class="contents">- Lastly, Commissioner, I have a question to ask you about the definition of the protection of the Community’s financial interests. Because this definition has been made in the following way: the falsification of milk products is only considered to be a problem for the Community if the perpetrators are in receipt of a Community subsidy. In other words, if they do not receive this subsidy, it is no longer an issue for the Community. This is completely absurd, Commissioner, for the following reasons: milk producers exceed their reference quantity – in other words, they are producing milk – and this milk has not been subsidised – the Community allows the industry that buys their milk to immediately enforce preventive retention, in other words, even before a quota surplus is observed, a preventive retention of money is made to pay a fine on the quota. In other words, even if these farmers have committed no offence, have not even increased their milk production, money is nonetheless taken from them. This is what is happening to milk producers. If we have an undertaking that is producing ‘fake’ milk products, in other words, that is making butter without milk, that is making butter with a huge variety of things that should never be used in any food product; totally artificial things, then the Community says the following: well, this is not our problem unless Community export subsidies have been received. This makes no sense at all! This is the Community doctrine, however, and has been the doctrine advocated in the Committee on Budgetary Control, year after year, and is still being advocated. I cannot accept this, Commissioner! I would like you also to explain to us clearly why the Commission is adopting this attitude, because I cannot explain it to anyone! I cannot go to the farmers of the region that I represent here and tell them something like this, because there is no possible explanation for this and therefore I should like the Commission to clearly explain the reason for this incongruity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Casaca was right to express concerns about irregularities. I would like to point out that Regulation 4045/89 scrutiny results in a high number of irregularities being reported to OLAF, and also in the identification of and follow-up to cases, to which Mr Casaca referred. This is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make clear the Commission position on some of the amendments and I will also try to answer Mr Casaca's four questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one concerns the legal basis. I have three points to make. Firstly, Regulation 4045/89 is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation. Therefore, Article 37 is the most appropriate legal basis. Secondly, these are technical amendments and there is no justification for making substantive changes at this point. Thirdly, the opinion of Mr Casaca's own committee – the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – based on the advice of Parliament's Legal Service, was that Article 37 was the most appropriate legal basis. It is very important for all those involved that a distinction is made between control and anti-fraud. That is why the Commission rejects this amendment on the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 2, 3 and 4 expand on or slightly strengthen the existing provisions and are acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment 5, I have to stress that, as Member States are already required to send the Commission a list of beneficiaries, this part of the amendment is unnecessary. The methods used by the Member States to calculate the minimum number of scrutinies have been checked by Commission services and found to be satisfactory. That is why the Commission rejects this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendment 6, even though it seems to be superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 7 exceeds the nature of a technical amendment, would mark a major change in the relations between Member States and could also have major legal effects. The Commission is not opposed to the amendment in itself but, in view of the legal and political issues, it is a question that needs to be taken up at horizontal level, and that is why the Commission rejects it.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments 8 and 9, the Committee on Budgetary Control wants Commission staff to carry out a certain number of controls each year, one in each Member State, plus one multinational control. In allocating its control efforts, the Commission makes use of risk analysis. This approach has been demanded and supported by the European Court of Auditors and Parliament. These Amendments 8 and 9 would drastically limit the effectiveness of any risk analysis because of the amount of work that would have to be done every year. DG Agriculture's audit services are responsible for the control of many measures, and to oblige them to carry out all the controls required by these amendments – whether they are high risk or not – is not an acceptable approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some Member States have one control service, others have several, and difficulties may be identified in some but not in others. However, Amendment 8 requires one control per Member State per year whatever the circumstances: this does not take account of the risks identified and will mean scarce resources also being used on low-risk controls. If Parliament insists on diverting from this professional audit approach, then it would also effectively be requiring the Commission to commit additional budgetary means to recruit the necessary staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the amendment by Mr Cunha aimed at publishing the list of beneficiaries, to which Mr Casaca referred. The Commission promotes openness and transparency but does not think that this is a wise proposal. The programme may be decided up to 12 months before the beginning of some scrutinies, and giving a beneficiary 12 months' notice of a control cannot be good control practice. In any event, Regulation 4045/89 forbids the use of nominative data in this way. I understand that there is also a volume question that has to do with the practicality of giving out some of the information in a meaningful way. That is why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific case concerning butter, I cannot supply all the details on that. However, I would ask you to send the Commission a written question on this case. We could then update you on what actions have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to come back to the other more general political questions, because I would like to restrict my comments to the proposal before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here is a Commission proposal, one that has been the subject of wide public discussion in Europe, on how the agricultural policy should be reformed. We are now telling you, Commissioner, which strands of the agricultural policy the Budget Control Committee believes should be changed. Its arguments are well known. The question of the legal basis – about Article 37 or Article 280, as proposed by us – is of course not just an academic one. It is about how public the area of agricultural policy should become. Is Parliament really on board, or is it not? It is about all these things. That is what we want, and we owe it to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When I said earlier that our present systems of export refunds cannot be made proof against fraud, you on the Commission ought really to have pricked up your ears, if you are really serious about protecting the tax revenues that we raise in the Member States. No reaction on the part of the Commission reaches my ears – on the contrary. Looking at the preliminary draft budget for the coming year, we find one particularly sensitive area, one I have mentioned before, namely the subsidies for exports of live animals, specifically cattle. On that, I must say that our budget is so lacking in transparency that Parliament first has to coax these export refunds, which do not even have a credit line of their own, out of it! Commissioner, we will try to get one in the 2003 budget year, so that we can get a slightly clearer view of things.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us get back to our cattle. I see that the figures for these next year are bigger than those for this year, adding up to a policy precisely contrary to what we actually wanted – down with export refunds, especially where live animals are tormented in the way they were in the past, and where the Commission is not in a position to guarantee the correct implementation of what the directives contain on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's budget, Commissioner, we already have an agreement between the Finance Ministers and Parliament to the effect that the Commission will, by 31 May, present a report on the proper implementation of the Animal Transport Directives in the Member States and the number of sanctions eventually imposed by the Commission on those Member States that may have contravened them. As yet, nothing has been put on the table – nothing! How are we to get to grips with the issue if you simply refuse to do anything? We will bring this issue up again. I would be very happy if we could leave this debate at least with the certainty that we would soon have your institution's report on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat: the policy you are at present pursuing runs directly counter to our own interests. You are increasing export refunds, at any rate for cattle. You cannot, then, shuffle off onto anyone else the responsibility for the unspeakable torments inflicted on the live animals that we are exporting to the Middle East. You yourselves must shoulder that responsibility, and if you think that controls in the Member States are in fact satisfactory on the whole, then I will repeat that last year's irregularities and frauds amounted to EUR 430 million. I do not know how our fellow-citizens of the EU understand your utterances on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was not in Johannesburg, and so I do not know whether you also represented us, but, Commissioner, was it not made clear to us there, all the time, that export refunds of this sort, this kind of agricultural policy, this type of subsidy, ends up making a massive contribution to the great misery to be found in many parts of the world? Oh yes, we will find room in our budget for some sort of aid, for handouts of some kind, but what I have said is a fact, and you are at present engaged in a policy contrary to the interests of these countries and, above all, against those of Europe's taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not let these<span class="italic"> </span>announcements<span class="italic"> </span>be the end of the matter. You may well have had the opportunity today to show your goodwill with a few small steps closer to what Parliament is proposing, but – and not only with regard to transparency – you have failed to do so, preferring to hide yourselves behind this or that paragraph. We, who seek re-election by our fellow-citizens, cannot do that. That is why we have to counter your conception of agricultural policy with our own.</p>

<p class="contents">In the UK this weekend there was a huge rally – Liberty and Livelihood – where thousands of people gathered in London to protest at various problems relating to the countryside. What this rally did not put across, however, was the way that the countryside is massively subsidised. Agriculture in particular is very heavily subsidised compared to every other industry in the European Union. When we see 40% of the EU budget going to 5% of the EU population then the policy is clearly in need of radical reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems strange to me, however, that within this reform process two areas are not being touched upon. These are the scandal of the EU sugar market, where extortionate prices throughout the EU enable people to take advantage of what I believe to be a very corrupt regime, and also the scandal of the tobacco industry, the existence of which people are bound to feel is an absolute contradiction at a time when the European Union is also trying to promote health initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">These are key areas. But the most important issue here today is transparency. Why is it that, while I can go to a website and find out where every single euro in relation to regional policy and Structural Funds is paid out in my area, I cannot do the same in relation to the common agricultural policy? That possibility does not exist and it is a possibility I want to see created. That is the relationship the taxpayers of Europe need to have with the recipients of this funding: in that way perhaps we will be able to see how much Prince Charles, the Queen and the rest of the royal family receive in relation to subsidies granted under the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to crack this open. It is crucial that we get the support of the people who call repeatedly in this House for transparency. That is what we are asking for. The Commission needs to cooperate much more closely with Member States across the whole of the European Union to ensure that this is the case.</p>

This is a fact. For 20 years, I have been hearing that this proportion should be reduced, but this is an extremely slow process. As an MEP, it fills me with great sadness and I am extremely disappointed about the fact that Parliament still has no grip on the situation. When Mr Casaca then tries – at least based on the authority which we clearly have, which is a budgetary authority – to gain an overview of the whole subsidy scheme, we do not exactly receive satisfactory feedback from you.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that you, as Commissioner, allow yourself to be fobbed off with what is being whispered into your ear by the bureaucrats who have accompanied you for so many years and who have for so long denied Parliament any direct input. After all, we want to gain a grip on agricultural policy, the export subsidies, and the way in which these subsidies are distributed. We would like to see an end to the exploitation of the developing countries. I fully concur with what Mr Bösch and Mrs Morgan said on this subject. When I was in Johannesburg, I was ashamed when I saw how, with our subsidies, we sound the death knell for a number of countries that have few resources to survive. There are a few countries that only have sugar to export, and we have managed to hold on to these wretched subsidies that we grant to our sugar barons thanks to our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has decided in the Committee on Development and Cooperation that this should stop. However, an amendment has crept in surreptitiously, upon which the plenary has yet again voted to maintain the agricultural subsidies for sugar. There are innumerable examples quoted here. As democratic representatives of our citizens, we would like a grip on these subsidies. Similarly, I fail to obtain an explanation for the way in which Europe manages to distribute unnecessary and harmful subsidies, while we are actually committed to solidarity with the developing world. I recently visited Botswana, where, apart from diamonds, they only have a few cattle to export. We concluded an agreement in this respect. There are so many African countries that wish to trade fairly with us, yet we still fail to create the opportunities for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that with regard to agricultural subsidies, export subsidies for live animals too are a disgrace and unacceptable to our public opinion. I am appalled to find out that you intend to increase these. Surely that is impossible. I should therefore like to concur with our fellow MEPs in their plea. I myself was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control for a while, and I have great respect for my fellow MEPs and for their reports. I always read the reports with great interest, but I would finally like to see some change. In the final analysis, we are not here to keep the show on the road; we are here to create justice.</p>

However, I will try to be loyal to those who have sent me as well, and I will leave some of the budgetary discussions to Mr Fischler, who will be here this afternoon for a discussion on the budget. So, on the detailed debate on the follow-up to the CAP, I hope that you appreciate that I am not <span class="italic">chef de file</span> on this matter. I leave it to Mr Fischler to answer all of those questions. I must say I also share a lot of your concerns and views on how to strengthen these rules and ensure that there is budgetary follow-up of the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say that I was always proud to represent the European Union when it comes to the issue of agricultural subsidies, but we can certainly say that we are taking a step in the right direction with our review of the common agricultural policy. I think that sometimes you are 'shooting the messenger' when criticism would be better addressed to some of the Member States, who are not always that happy to reform the common agricultural policy and to move in the right direction. We know what is necessary when it comes to satisfying the developing countries. We know that we have to reward quality rather than quantity, thus encouraging public health. We know that we have to protect and restore habitats and natural systems, and to reverse the loss of biodiversity. We also know that we have to improve land use management via increased rural development and so on. We have to also make sure that we look more at quality rather than creating over-production and an absolutely sick system.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken, as I have said, a step in right direction with the review of the</p>
<p class="contents">common agricultural policy. We will have to continue discussions with Member States, because a lot of these responsibilities will have to be shared with Member States, including the protection of animal welfare. I am as ashamed as you are when we see these pictures and practices, and they simply have to be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that some of the measures proposed in the review, including auditing systems etc., and linking the economic support so as to make cross-compliance necessary, could also help in improving animal welfare, as well as other factors in the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As much as I share your concerns, and although I think that you are right in pointing out these problems, we will have to take that full debate at some other time. I will leave it to Mr Fischler to come back to you on the budgetary consequences of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am more than happy to invite you to tomorrow's debate on the follow-up to the Johannesburg summit. This is definitely one of the important elements. A lot of the discussions in Johannesburg were poisoned by the agricultural subsidies, and we will have to address that issue now or later.</p>
