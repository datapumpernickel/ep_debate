I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your comments and suggestions, which we will have to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have greatly criticised the Nice Summit, yet it has provided you with a valuable instrument: the Social Agenda, which was drawn up with the objective of making the European Union the world’s most competitive economy, as decided at the Lisbon Summit. As we all know that there is no openness between European, national and local partners, this agenda raises the issue of responsibility and attribution of powers of all those playing a part in its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in its dual role of ensuring openness and acting as a social instrument that the Social Agenda is a key component of economic and social modernisation, as its implementation will, in the long term, be decisive for achieving the strategic objectives laid down by the Lisbon European Council. We are sure of this, even if it is not currently given much consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is why Parliament and its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs deeply regretted not having been able to consider the Social Agenda prior to the Stockholm European Council. We therefore ask that Parliament be involved in the implementation of the adjustment of the Social Agenda, as well as all the social partners, and we insist that, from now on, the scoreboard make clearer the various responsibilities of the parties involved. We also call on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requests we have made: to define an appropriate legal basis for the development of civil dialogue; to provide a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy; to integrate the social dimension into competition policy; to submit a directive on social security cover for new forms of employment; to reinforce the action programme and instruments against poverty and social exclusion and submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/85/EC on introducing measures to help improve the health and safety of female workers; and to launch an initiative aimed at better guaranteeing the social quality of work.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also understand, Commissioner, that we are calling on you to speed up a number of operations: in particular to submit a proposal for a review of the enterprise committee directive as soon as possible so that the legislative procedure can be concluded as intended, to submit to Parliament a memorandum on policy in the area of health and safety at work that could serve as a consultation document, to conduct in-depth examination and assessment of the impact of the Luxembourg process, and, lastly, to propose activities to mark the European year of the disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are convinced that this scoreboard should not be confined to setting out actions implemented by the Commission but should eventually become a strategic instrument by means of which the agenda’s implementation can be supervised, and where need be adjusted. We are also convinced that partnerships should be strengthened in all the actions taken in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Nice has provided you with a valuable tool. You therefore have a valuable role to play in making social policy more transparent. Take this opportunity to transform this Europe of commodities into a people’s Europe, in the knowledge that Parliament will be right behind you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with her that the table of results of the Social Agenda should include all planned activities and the division of responsibilities and should be submitted to the European Parliament within a reasonable period of time so that Parliament can study and give an opinion on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has supported the Commission proposal on a cohesive policy framework for social development right from the start, although it did point out that the updated European standard which was the whole purpose of the Social Agenda should serve the values of solidarity and justice underlying the European structure better and more efficiently, given that these values are currently under attack. In order to promote these values, the European Parliament stresses in its resolution that we also need to promote the full participation of women in economic and social life.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also stresses in its resolution that the gender dimension needs to be included in all sectors covered by the Social Agenda and monitored in regular reports. We need a proposal to amend the directive on the safety and health of pregnant and breastfeeding workers, i.e. directive 92/85. We need to highlight the fact that the social partners have a responsibility to put the principles of equal pay and equal opportunities into practice. We need to take an initiative to improve working hours and strike a better balance between work and home, we need a more substantial take on sexual equality in all pre-accession negotiations and we need to promote dialogue with women's organisations in candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights for the Social Agenda, I should like to ask the Commission to tell the European Parliament how it intends to follow up these issues and if it intends to present a proposal for a directive on equal treatment in sectors other than the employment sector. Finally, the European Parliament has highlighted the need to make it easier for social agencies to take part and I should like to ask what initiatives you intend to take to increase the participation of women's organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should obviously, first and foremost, like to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for her excellent cooperation. The result is there for everyone to see. This report is based on a very broad consensus, for not one single amendment has been tabled. However, I should also like to say that, with this report, the European Parliament actually falls between two stools. On the one hand, it is a fact that the scoreboard which we are discussing has actually been outdated for a long time. On the other hand, the new scoreboard has not yet been finally rubberstamped by the European Commission, despite the fact that, in Stockholm, we were assured that this scoreboard, together with the summary report for Barcelona, would be before us by no later than January.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, at any rate, like to thank the Commissioner for the opportunity we have had, together with the coordinators, of obtaining current information about the Commission’s intentions, and of making our concerns known regarding the state of implementation of the Social Agenda. Commissioner, in my view, we should make this sound initiative an integral part of the procedure in order to guarantee Parliament’s involvement during the implementation of the Social Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to afford this debate a little more topical value by seizing the opportunity urgently to call upon you, Commissioner, but especially – and I am stressing this – the entire board of Commissioners, to implement the ambitions of the Social Agenda and the pledges made during the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies down to the last detail and according to the time schedule. After all, Commissioner, there are quite a few reasons why we are concerned. It is, of course, the case that 2001 has produced some welcome results, but it is vital to keep this momentum going and, for this, we need a new and better scoreboard, which clearly indicates the responsibilities with the attendant expiry dates.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you a few reasons why we are concerned. First of all, the role of the social partners in relation to labour organisation and lifelong learning is crucial if the Social Agenda is to be implemented , and I hope that their contribution to Barcelona will be considerable. But where consultation fails, the legislator needs to step in, and this is currently the case with temporary agency work, in connection with which we have long been waiting impatiently for a Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following the successful completion of the directive on worker participation in the framework of the European Company and the directive on the information and consultation of workers, nothing now stands in the way of a review of the enterprise committee directive. This also applies to the action plan to improve health and safety which Mrs Hermange introduced a moment ago. According to the Social Agenda, the initiatives should have been before us at the end of 2001/beginning of 2002, but, Commissioner, there is no trace of these in the operational programme of the Commission. I am also picking up signals that there is quite a bit of resistance in the Commission. I should therefore like to say one thing in conclusion, Mr President. I should like you, Commissioner, to pass on these words to the College of Commissioners: <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda </span>[<span class="italic">Treaties should be respected</span>]. This Parliament will never accept the Social Agenda being shelved, and I hope that you will be able to use the support of this Parliament in the College of Commissioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, it is only fair to give notice to the House that we may find ourselves less able to form part of a consensus when the Commission brings forward some of the proposals referred to in paragraph 14.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases it will depend on the form of the proposals, given our commitment to subsidiarity; in others, it will depend on their exact content. I would, for example, express my own concerns in both respects over the second indent of the paragraph and any proposals for providing a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy, the third sector. Many voluntary organisations have already expressed their worries to me that such a measure, unless we get it exactly right, could well prove more of a hindrance than a help to their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just one of the reasons why I would like to give wholehearted support to the first indent of paragraph 14. Knowing how much volunteers contribute to our well-being, I sometimes wonder just how much of a society we would have without their efforts. We urgently need a proper legal base for the civil dialogue. Without one, we will find it much more difficult to do what the President of Parliament urged us to do yesterday: involve EU citizens in the creation of a Europe fit for its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not run counter to society’s wishes: I refer to the second World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, which has once again put into perspective many of the social choices which are to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to respond to the expectations of the European citizens. However, any headway is progress, and I also welcome the comments in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the social policy agenda. I also welcome Mrs Hermange’s decision to include a number of fundamental comments in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise three points from the recommendations made by the report. First, I am sorry that the Commission failed to take into consideration Parliament’s requests with regard to the right to strike at European level and the right to take collective action. These two rights seem to me to be essential to the correct working of the social relationship between employees, employers and politicians. These rights represent progress which could be classed as progress in civilisation and Europe should not be behind in this matter, as democracy is regularly at the heart of our concerns in this Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I would like to emphasise the report’s request that efforts to address the social dimension of enlargement be stepped up. This issue must also be at the heart of our concerns. Enlargement must succeed. It will not succeed if it is confined to a restricted vision of convergence criteria. Success would involve taking account of the needs of the people and the potential of each candidate country with a view to increasing everyone’s quality of life and of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, I believe it is extremely important that all Commission decisions on concentrations and mergers take account of the social consequences and regional planning. The issue of the action to be taken and implementation is obviously crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I agree with most of the comments expressed in Mrs Hermange’s report and my group will, of course, vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are looking for a greater role as a parliament in ensuring that we can conclude agreements with regard to social inclusion, so as to best respond to the needs and demands of those people we represent. Parliament's role must be a constructive one. However, I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape, which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We must favour creating a proper business environment where employment can be created, and where proper and real jobs can be maintained within the European Union. Nowadays when we look around the world we can see how it is more common and easier for industry and business to relocate outside areas with high social costs and high taxation. We must work towards a more progressive system in which workers are entitled to keep as much of their earned income as possible and there is better provision of services in the social sphere in areas such as housing, health and education through the national exchequer. We may not achieve those with the proposals contained in this report. I am in favour of the report, but I have specific concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also look at the whole legislative process implied by what is being called for in this report. Although Parliament is seeking a greater role, more involvement in coordination and quicker action, with hindsight it is also looking for more legislation to be put in place. Legislative instruments are called for when negotiations are not concluded in relation to training, lifelong learning, organisation of work, adjustments, new forms of work, guidelines for negotiations by social partners and supplementary sickness insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has proposed something different. The Commission is taking a far more proactive and forward-looking approach in its proposals. We must support the call for research, which unfortunately was not highlighted within the committee report. There has to be a radical increase in employment participation. An emphasis must be put on better jobs. More must be done towards building a European labour market with more mobility included within it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must play a greater and clearer role as regards the place within society of those with disabilities. These people represent 10 % of the population, yet they are excluded from so many walks of life. We have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a new instrument that is being developed. It is the first time that it is on the table, so it goes without saying that it will require fine-tuning in future. All criticism should therefore be seen in this light, and criticism is obviously always relative. I welcome this instrument, and would want to make two comments in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have developed a great deal of European legislation. One of the aspects to which the annex to the communication refers is the need for codification. This is absolutely vital, in my view, for the complexity of European legislation and the large quantity of European legislation are starting to play tricks on us. Needless to say, we can insist on more European legislation, and more European legislation is probably required in the social field. However, there should also come a time where we can catch our breaths and take stock, certainly in the light of enlargement. After all, all these new laws will also need to be transposed in the candidate countries. If I consider the social situation in the candidate countries, then this is certainly not straightforward. They are very poorly developed in the social field, and if we pass new laws, these will also apply to them. I therefore call for occasional reviews to be drawn up of the situation as it stands. Would it not be useful to consider the results of all the existing laws? How do they operate in practice? Also, should the results in practice not be included in the scoreboard so that we at any rate have an overview, not only of our wishes for improvement, but also of the reality in the field? I call for including this too in the scoreboard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share her analysis and also the criticisms she has raised in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to thank you, Commissioner, for your ideas on the Barcelona Summit. Only this morning, I was telling a party of visitors from Bad Hersfeld how much commitment you demonstrate. Your agenda has enjoyed very strong support from Parliament, and especially from the group to which I belong, but we now expect definite proposals and initiatives, action plans and also – Mrs Smet – directives. This will not work in the complete absence of directives. Of course, we should make more use than hitherto of the new method of coordination, especially in discussions with the candidate countries. I see that as an excellent instrument for getting these countries involved right now and also giving them the opportunity to set out to us their current concerns and needs, and what they have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too, I do not share Mrs Smet's opinion that these candidate countries lag behind on all these points. I think we urgently need a reform of the European Works Councils directive. If you have problems at the Commission, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also shape social policy along precautionary lines, and not always leave it until, so to speak, the child has fallen down the well. The scandal surrounding lorry drivers in Luxembourg is only the tip of the iceberg. The head of Luxembourg's government has said that there is an urgent need for action on the part of the European Union, and perhaps we should take him at his word. The Spanish presidency is, unfortunately, rather hesitant, but, Commissioner, Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are still seeing not only major delays in this policy’s implementation, however, but also that concerns with social policies are not being reflected in other policies and in the Community budget and we are even seeing a reduction in funds in the fields of employment and social affairs, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in the field of social inclusion, and despite the miles of paper that have already been used up on the subject and despite national inclusion plans and countless declarations of intent, there are still serious problems which could grow worse as a result of the slowdown in economic activity and the insistence on privatisations in fundamental sectors and in public services that are essential to a genuine policy of social inclusion, in addition to the fact that financial resources are still very thin on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union’s leaders persist in this approach, there is a danger, as the report states, that the commitments given in the Agenda will not be fully met by 2005. This is why it is so important for the Commission to speed up its work and, above all, to change its policies, giving the utmost priority to the social aspect in areas such as quality employment with rights, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the guarantee of access to fundamental rights, specifically for the more vulnerable social groups such as children, the elderly, immigrants and the disabled and the establishment of equal opportunities for men and women in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Marie-Therèse Hermange and her colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for including in the report proposals that I tabled, specifically on asking the Commission to adopt initiatives and to present an action plan for the effective prevention of musculoskeletal injuries at work, to take initiatives to provide appropriate safeguards for workers’ rights, and notably employment, in the event of the restructuring or relocation of undertakings and to take initiatives, and notably adopt an action plan, to put into practice equality of payment for men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not, of course, want to ignore the various initiatives planned by the Commission regarding employment and certain social issues, nor do we want to disregard the negotiation initiatives undertaken by the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, although the agenda has a programme structure, endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions, in particular – and which, moreover I clearly support – this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive, removed from the original plan and goals set. Indeed, I wonder whether, in the meantime, a predefined model and predefined frameworks exist, within which the responsibilities laid down by the agenda for the many parties involved can be exercised; whether there is evidence of even embryonic good quality work and what its particular characteristics are; whether the job placement systems and systems providing information on opportunities are successfully fulfilling their role and whether school and training courses are starting to be rationalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it should be ascertained, at both Community and national level, whether industrial relations are moving steadily towards general development in terms of flexibility and security and whether local bodies and social forces are starting to cooperate responsibly in respect of national action plans and whether these plans are starting to be fully consistent with Union guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be appropriate to ascertain, in order to get an overall picture, whether the States have at least initiated an internal debate on their social rules, on cohesion within their national territories and on the integration of groups which are relatively or extremely marginalised because of age, disability, sex or profession.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point concerns enlargement, on which the agenda focuses greatly, unlike this initial assessment, which merely refers to NGOs’ activities, although that is not to say they are not important.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the point we are trying to make is that, although much of the issue is left to the principle of subsidiarity and the active responsibility of a number of parties to manage, the social protocol, although behind schedule, is an integral part of the Treaties, and social policy at last goes hand in hand with economic policy in the open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, vital that the Commission take a more incisive, specific role, which must be shared by the European Parliament in a more substantial, ongoing fashion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am at the same time concerned that the work has led to the request for a long list of legislative initiatives on the part of the Commission, relating for example to lifelong learning, organisation of work, the need to reconcile work and private life, working environment policy, supplementary sickness insurance and the hiring-out of staff.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main reasons why I believe that demands for legislative initiatives within these areas are the wrong road to go down. First of all, we Swedish Conservatives believe that these issues should not be dealt with at Community level. They are best dealt with at national level and, best of all of course, through negotiations at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that adding more and more pages of legislation to the thousands upon thousands of pages that the candidate countries are now already required to accept and incorporate into their own legislation would make it considerably more difficult to implement any enlargement of the EU. I therefore agree with what my colleague, Mrs Smet, said about its being important to pause and reflect and to review the legislation that already exists.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not being given the opportunity to vote against individual points in the report. We Swedish Conservatives will not be able to support the report as a whole in the final vote, in spite of the fact that there is actually a lot in the report that we think is positive. Unfortunately, the initiatives are, as I said just now, to be taken at the wrong level. They should be taken at national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Smet said, it is vital that we understand that this is the first social policy tool we have had at European level, a tool achieved with a great deal of hard work and sensitive negotiation. The report and the amendments tabled by the honourable Members touch on three issues: content, time and procedure. As far as the content is concerned, I would remind the House that the Commission highlighted the need for a binding Social Agenda in the spring of 2000 and spent 6 months making important policy preparations in close collaboration with the French presidency and Parliament, in the person of Mrs Van Lancker, resulting in Nice in agreement between the leading countries, for the first time ever, on a long-term, five-year Social Agenda. The Commission was specifically instructed to implement this Social Agenda and it announces a programme every year so that the commitments made will be fulfilled by 2005. I should like to remind the House that I presented the results of the first year's implementation of the Agenda to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in October 2000. It was 100% efficient; there was a 100% correlation between commitments and implementation. In October 2001, I again presented a table of actions in 2001 to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and again there was a 100% correlation between commitments and results. The question is, does the Agenda remain constant or does it absorb new factors over the course of time?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is basically – or rather absolutely – committed to the Social Agenda as adopted in Nice on the basis of the Agenda agreed in 2000. In the meantime, we have promised to review it in 2003 and, of course, I agree with the report that Parliament will need to play an important part if we are to have the facility to adjust it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns time. First, the report on the Agenda and the Commission's summary report to the spring Council need to be submitted at the same time. This always creates problems, which we are trying to resolve. Secondly, our criticism is based on the results of the first year of the Agenda, as Mrs Hermange says in her report, so we must bear in mind that the report in question had to be submitted two months after the decision taken in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the procedure. I agree with the report on three points: first, that the Social Agenda and the table of results cannot simply be a statement of past action and should make a careful examination of broader achievements and look to the future. Secondly, it must refer back to the wider review of the factors involved and look forward to future expectations, these factors being, of course, the social partners, together with women's organisations and civic society organisations, as described by the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that the stability and cohesiveness of the Agenda are not written in stone, i.e. we must intervene wherever there is an emergency or new elements create problems at social level with social repercussions. As was the case recently with the initiative on restructuring, to which the Member in question has already referred, where we had 350,000 redundancies in a year due to corporate restructuring in the European Union. We had no choice but to intervene, even though there was no commitment in the Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, I am positive that this report and the close collaboration with the committee in question will help to improve consistently the performance of the Social Agenda which, I would again remind the House, is a completely new tool and which close cooperation will help to make even better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
