<p>The honourable Member is referring to several recent incidents connected with Israeli military aircraft flying in Lebanese airspace.</p>
<p>The Council has consistently held the opinion that everyone should respect Lebanese sovereignty on its land, in its waters and in its airspace.</p>
<p>Owing to the incidents regarding the French and German vessels that the honourable Member alludes to, in its conclusions of 13 November 2006 the Council urged Israel to end its violations regarding Lebanese airspace. In addition, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and two EU countries made official contact with the Israeli authorities with respect to this issue. Since then there has been no news of any ‘pretend’ attacks against UNIFIL peacekeepers by Israeli jet fighters.</p>
<p>The Council expects Israel to comply with the agreement to end hostilities.</p>
<p>The Council staunchly supports the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. It has consistently called on all countries in the region to comply with the Resolution, especially with regard to non-proliferation. The EU has a high profile in the UNIFIL operation, which is reflected in the extent to which the Member States are involved in the operation. More than 8 000 troops from EU countries are already positioned in southern Lebanon to support the armed forces.</p>
<p>It is the Council’s opinion that the UNIFIL peacekeepers are the best people to ensure that there is compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0985"></a>

<p>In recent times the EU has in various contexts pointed out emphatically to the Colombian authorities that it considers the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to be important. The Office has had a major impact on human rights protection and the promotion of international humanitarian law in Colombia.

The Council is expecting to engage in regular dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the role of the Colombian Office.</p>
<p>Despite efforts on the part of the Colombian authorities and an improvement in the general situation, the human rights situation is still worrying, especially since the humanitarian agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia on the release of captured individuals was watered down. The Council is worried about the state of collapse that has resulted from new outbreaks of violence and is urging all sides to do all they can to find a solution.</p>

<p>Numerous reputable organisations, including the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SNF) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), have criticised the EU's fishing quotas as being far too generous. On 3 November 2006, a group of researchers presented their findings in the journal Science which indicate that, in 40 years' time, table fish will have died out. The Commission and the Council, however, do not appear to take these alarming signals seriously. The EU Council of Fisheries Ministers decided at the end of October that cod fishing in the North Sea and east of Bornholm should be reduced by only 10% in 2007. This decision stands in stark contrast to the recommendations made by numerous researchers and organisations, such as the ICES and the SNF.</p>
<p>How does the Council justify maintaining the high quotas for cod fishing in the North Sea and east of Bornholm?

<p>On this matter the Council would like to remind you that the political consensus reached in October 2006 only applies to cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and not to those in the North Sea. That same consensus was, moreover, a compromise that took account of the worrying state of affairs with regard to those particular fish stocks. For this reason the solution arrived at contains a condition that states that the Council must adopt a multiannual plan for cod stocks in the Baltic by 30 June 2007. If the Council fails to do this, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for cod will be automatically reduced further on 1 July 2007. TACs and quotas for Baltic cod would be cut by 15% compared to levels this year. All catches that exceed the quotas announced on that day will be subtracted from those for 2008. Furthermore, the Council’s agreement called for a reduction in the number of days when cod fishing in the Baltic Sea is specifically permitted. Cod fishing in 2007 has been prohibited generally for around five months in the eastern part of the sea and four months in the western part. In both areas the ban is approximately one month longer than it was this year.</p>
<p>The Council expects to reach an agreement at its sitting of 19-21 December 2006 on a proposal for TACs and quotas in other waters, such as the North Sea.</p>

<p>The honourable Member is referring to Israel’s military operation in the town of Beit Hanoun in Gaza on 8 November 2006.</p>
<p>The Presidency and High Representative gave a clear and categorical opinion on these military actions in its statements of 8 November.</p>
<p>Although the EU recognises Israel’s right to protect its citizens from terrorist strikes and from rockets fired from Gaza at its territory, it has constantly stated that Israel is obliged to exercise this right in accordance with international law.</p>
<p>Regarding recent positive events, the EU was pleased with the ceasefire that came into effect in Gaza on 26 November. It is important that this should be reinforced and extended to cover the West Bank. We need to provide encouragement to both sides so that they now start taking other measures to boost trust, such as the release of prisoners.</p>

The result would be a viable and independent Palestinian state existing peacefully alongside Israel and surrounded by recognised and secure borders.

<p>The newspaper ‘Oberösterreichische Nachrichten’ reported on 2 November 2006 that, at the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, there were ever increasing problems in the active zone because of excessively deformed fuel rods.

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in December 2006.</p>
<p>The Council will not adopt a position on news published in the mass media and is not familiar with the findings to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, the Union has consistently emphasised the importance of strict nuclear safety standards and high levels of environmental protection. The Council will state once again that it regards nuclear safety as being extremely important and that it gives its full support to efforts to ensure high levels of nuclear safety everywhere in the European Union. As the honourable Member will perhaps recall, the Council undertook a thorough study of nuclear safety in the new Member States before they acceded to the Union, and made special recommendations regarding the Temelin nuclear power station.</p>
<p>Every nuclear power plant operator must comply with the regulations on safety and precautions in the Community and the relevant Member State. The national nuclear safety and radiation authorities are responsible for the necessary inspections. Council Directive 96/29/Euratom lays down basic standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation, and stipulates basic obligations relating to radiation protection, which must be complied with.</p>
<p>Under Articles 35 and 36 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) the Commission is to be kept informed of radioactivity levels to which the public is exposed. It is also the Commission’s task to ensure that secondary legislation, such as Directive 96/29/Euratom, is properly implemented.</p>
<p>Article 28 of the Euratom Treaty states that the Commission has the right to require a Member State to take measures to prevent infringement of the basic standards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1000"></a>

<p>Unusually, in presenting its report on Turkey's progress towards accession, the Commission did not submit any proposals for possible sanctions in the event of Turkey failing to fulfil its obligations, which constitutes a fundamental aspect of the decision to be taken by the European Council meeting in December.

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in December 2006.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, Turkey has a contractual obligation to ensure full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, and the removal of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, including restrictions on means of transport. This obligation is clearly set out in the Negotiation Framework and is part of the Accession Partnership. The Declaration of 21 September 2005 stated that the Union would evaluate full implementation in 2006. In the Declaration it was emphasised that the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters would depend on Turkey’s implementation of its contractual obligations to all Member States, and that if these were not implemented fully, it would affect the overall progress in the negotiations. Moreover, the Council in 2006 also agreed that it would ensure the monitoring of progress achieved on all pertinent matters contained in the Declaration. This was confirmed this year by the European Council which met in June.</p>
<p>The General Affairs and External Relations Council examined and made a thorough appraisal of the situation on 11 December. It decided that the EU would not commence talks on any subsequent chapters before the Commission had ensured that Turkey had fulfilled its agreements relating to the Additional Protocol:</p>
<p>– Free movement of goods</p>
<p>– The right of establishment and the free provision of services</p>
<p>– Financial services</p>
<p>– Agriculture and rural development</p>
<p>– Fishing</p>
<p>– Transport policy</p>
<p>– Customs union</p>
<p>– Foreign relations.</p>
<p>The General Affairs and External Relations Council also decided that there would be no decision taken for now on discussion of any chapter before the Commission had ensured that Turkey had fulfilled its agreements relating to the Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>Talks on the other chapters will resume in accordance with the Negotiation Framework.</p>
<p>The Council’s conclusions of 11 December are available to the honourable Member for closer scrutiny. All the other important documents relating to Turkey’s accession process are also available to the honourable Member. These are the General Negotiation Framework, the Accession Partnership, the Declaration of 21 September 2005, previous conclusions of the European Council, and the Commission’s recent Enlargement Strategy document 2006 and its Progress Report on Turkey 2006. This means that the European Parliament is very well aware of the general situation with respect to the negotiation process with Turkey. The Council is unanimous in its opinion that the European Parliament and the European public must be kept informed of the future prospects for that process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1002"></a>

<p>The Sámi are the only indigenous people of the European Union. They live in a region covering four countries. When Finland and Sweden joined the European Union, the Member States recognised the obligations and commitments of Sweden and Finland with regard to the Sámi people under national and international law, as stated in Protocol 3 to the Accession Agreement. This was especially relevant to these countries’ commitment to preserving and developing the means of livelihood, language, culture and way of life of the Sámi people, and they considered that traditional Sámi culture and livelihood depended on primary economic activities, such as reindeer husbandry, in the traditional areas of Sámi settlement. In the Protocol it was agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of the EC Treaty, exclusive rights to reindeer husbandry within traditional Sámi areas may be granted to the Sámi people in these countries. It was also agreed that the Protocol may be extended to take account of any further development of exclusive Sámi rights linked to their traditional means of livelihood. Exclusive rights relating to reindeer husbandry may be decided nationally, but decisions on other exclusive rights pertaining to Sámi livelihoods are taken by the Council using the procedure described in the Protocol. The Sámi have exclusive rights to reindeer husbandry under the Protocol in Sweden, but not in Finland.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that the Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. The Charter also states that everyone is equal before the law and mentions non-discrimination, which is also stated in Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p>The Council has not, however, discussed the issues referred to in the question, and there are no projects pending in the Union in connection with either them or the rights described in Protocol 3.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1004"></a>

<p>Reducing the quantity of synthetic drugs, such as metamphetamines, produced and offered for sale is among the aims of the EU Action Plan on Drugs (2005-2008)<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Member States and Europol have given undertakings to develop operations and intelligence-gathering projects to reduce the manufacture and supply of synthetic drugs (Objective 20.1). The implementation of the Action Plan on Drugs is monitored systematically and the first annual assessment report is scheduled for submission in December 2006.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is also asked to read the 2006 Annual Report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), which states that use of metamphetamine is on the increase worldwide. Use of metamphetamine is reported to have caused substantial problems in various parts of the world, inter alia in the USA, South-East Asia and the Pacific region, as well as Africa. Although the problem has grown worldwide, use of metamphetamine in Europe is limited to a few countries where long-term problems have arisen. However, the fact that more and more countries have reported seizures of metamphetamine clearly shows that even in Europe there may be a risk that use of this drug will become more prevalent.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the December 2006 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In general, the Council would ask the Honourable Member to read the answer which the Council gave to Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0073_EN.html">H-0073/06</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous Council measures can and do help to combat youth and long-term unemployment<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in Europe, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>As it is difficult to present all the actions taken by a European institution such as the Council, mention may be made, in this connection, of certain Council measures adopted in 2006 which particularly related to youth or long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that the Member States themselves are responsible for planning and implementing their measures to reduce youth and long-term unemployment under the European Employment Strategy. In 2006 the Employment Committee continued to make comparative assessments of Member States' employment policies, this being an established practice, and reported to the Council on its findings. In general it was possible to observe that youth and long-term unemployment was among the priorities of action by the Member States. The Member States were conscious of the themes requiring action, and this year's national reform programmes included more political measures in accordance with the European Pact for Youth, so that the situation is expected to improve as far as young people are concerned.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will naturally be aware that, as legislators, the Council and Parliament negotiated and also succeeded in reaching agreement on various funding programmes for the years 2007-2013 which either sought to improve understanding of the situation of the unemployed or specifically took as their target group young people or the unemployed. Among these, reference may be made to the PROGRESS programme – which serves, inter alia, to support the implementation of the European Employment Strategy – the new Youth in Action programme, the European Structural Fund financial measures to solve problems arising from early school leaving and the future European Globalisation Fund.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Presidencies, Austria and Finland, asked the Employment Committee to consider issues relating directly to youth and long-term unemployment. During Austria's Presidency, the Employment Committee considered 'flexicurity' – the combination of flexibility and security – and during Finland's Presidency the Committee drafted an opinion on increasing productivity and creating new and better jobs, including for those in a weak position on the labour market. Both opinions were forwarded to the Council, which approved them.

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in December 2006.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member may be aware, the Council has of late been working very actively, in close cooperation with the Commission, towards developing a Community external energy policy, with a view inter alia to ensuring security of energy supply in the Community. The Council stresses that this policy in its final form will shape relations between the EU and Russia in the field of energy.</p>
<p>During the Finnish Presidency significant progress has been made in understanding the views of the two sides. At the unofficial dinner of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti on 20 October, energy matters were discussed in an open exchange of views with President Putin. These unofficial discussions played an important part in paving the way for the EU-Russia summit held in Helsinki on 24 November. The summit concentrated on cooperation between the EU and Russia in various areas, including in particular that of energy.</p>
<p>The Community is working towards the inclusion, in the new comprehensive EU-Russia agreement replacing the current partnership and cooperation agreement, of an important section on energy matters. The negotiating mandate for a new agreement was discussed during the Finnish Presidency and it is hoped that it will be completed in the near future so that negotiations with Russia can begin as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In connection with the dialogue between the EU and Russia on energy matters, the second meeting of the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council on energy was held on 8 December 2006. The Permanent Partnership Council was satisfied with the four thematic surveys – dealing with the topics of investments, infrastructure, trade and energy efficiency – as well as with the recommendations for further work.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1016"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency, which is not binding as such on the Council or its members, was not presented orally at the part of Question Time given over to questions to the Council at Parliament’s December 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 13 November 2006 the Council expressed its satisfaction at the fact that the second round of the presidential election and the provincial assembly elections held in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 29 October 2006 had, on the whole, passed off peacefully and been conducted in an orderly manner. The elected President, Joseph Kabila, was inaugurated on 6 December 2006.</p>
<p>The Council praised the Independent Electoral Commission, which had enabled the electoral process to remain credible and transparent.</p>
<p>It drew particular attention to the role of those who had supported the elections, that is to say, the international community, especially the United Nations, including the UN monitoring troops (MONUC), together with the African countries which had entered into bilateral commitments, as well as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union.</p>
<p>The Council noted that the EU had provided assistance in order to help the DRC fulfil the essential preconditions for, and to facilitate the run-up to, the elections, and that the EUFOR military mission had likewise made a useful contribution in support of MONUC. It confirmed that the EU was ready to back the DRC and its new democratically elected leaders in their future efforts to develop their country for the benefit of the Congolese people.</p>
<p>The Council pointed to the regional significance of the elections, which would help to promote stability and development in the Great Lakes region and Central Africa.</p>
<p>This subject will also be discussed at the Foreign Ministers’ dinner at the European Council on 14 and 15 December 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1026"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the December 2006 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The questions raised by the Honourable Member relate to the plenary debate in the European Parliament on 15 November 2006 after Finland's Minister for European Affairs, Paula Lehtomäki, replied to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/O-6-2006-0115_EN.html">O-0115/06</a> - B6-442/06.</p>
<p>The proposal for the establishment of a European civil protection force was made in the report, 'For a European civil protection force: European aid'<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, presented by Michel Barnier in May 2006. The June 2006 European Council<a href="#defann_16_2" name="refann_16_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> noted the report with satisfaction and described it as an important contribution to the debate. The proposal for the establishment of a European civil protection force is not, as such, being considered by the various bodies of the Council.</p>
<p>The June 2006 European Council asked the Secretary-General of the Council/High Representative, and the Commission, to make proposals on protection by consular authorities and, inter alia, on establishing mutual consular assistance points in pre-identified regions. However, protection by consular authorities is a matter for Member States, while the EU Institutions provide administrative or logistic assistance only at the request of the Member State concerned or of the Presidency.</p>
<p>The Council's work to improve the European Union's emergency and crisis preparedness is described in a report to the December 2006 European Council<a href="#defann_16_3" name="refann_16_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council is currently considering two legislative proposals from the Commission: the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies (renamed 'Civil protection financial instrument') and the proposal for a Council Decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism (recast).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is presently looking at the amended proposal regarding the European Parliament and Council Directive, to which the honourable Member refers. This is a directive for criminal sanctions with a view to ensuring compliance with intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>At the Justice and Home Affairs Council in October 2006 several Member States said that they hoped that the need for criminal proceedings to protect intellectual property rights at EU level would be examined further from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity. Many Member States also stressed the importance of an appraisal of Directive 2004/48/EC and the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in case C-440/05, which provides guidance on the Community’s competence in adopting criminal sanctions. Consequently, there has been no continuation of the debate on the proposal for a directive during the Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p>With regard to the implementation and appraisal of Directive 2004/48/EC, the honourable Member should remember that further action on this falls within the competence of the European Commission, and so the Council is unable to answer this question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Insofar as any such discussion can be said to have a concrete outcome, the Education, Youth and Culture Council held on 13 November 2006 enabled attention to be paid to many areas where youth research was thought to be capable of promoting understanding and knowledge of youth.</p>
<p>During the discussion there was general agreement both that the development of youth policy depended on whether reliable data, both quantitative and qualitative, would be obtainable through independent research, and that in such research there should be a focus on areas that are important for political decisions in the youth sector. Member States should continue their work to establish a knowledge base for questions pertaining to youth, at the same time focusing too on the priorities mentioned in the European Pact for Youth. If the European Pact for Youth and other priorities on youth policy are to be implemented effectively, a fact-based approach will need to be adopted.</p>
<p>We were also broadly of the opinion that the most effective way to develop and implement a coordinated horizontal youth policy is better organised dialogue between actors in the youth sector. Research into the importance of a youth policy should be carried out in close cooperation with authorities in the field, young people, players actively involved in the youth sector and with youth organisations, taking care that research topics are closely linked to young people’s ordinary everyday lives. To this end, there should be efforts to develop policy, research, youth work and national networks that cover young people.</p>
<p>Several delegations emphasised the importance of the role of the European Knowledge Centre for Youth Policy. The quality and viability of this tool depend, however, on the work of the national contacts that supply it with information and update it. These should therefore be supported in all respects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1049"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in December 2006.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member quite rightly says, it was one of the aims of the Presidency to revive the debate in the Council on the development of freight transport logistics. The Council’s conclusions on the Commission communication entitled ‘Freight Logistics in Europe – key to sustainable mobility’ were adopted at its sitting on 12 December 2006.</p>
<p>In the field of EU external relations in air transport, on 4 December 2006 the Council took a decision to sign the Euro-Mediterranean agreement on aviation and its temporary enforcement with Morocco. In addition, three horizontal agreements were finally adopted with the Maldives, Paraguay and Uruguay during the Finnish presidential term. The Finnish Presidency has been closely monitoring the talks on the air transport agreement with the United States of America (‘Open Sky’) and has made a major contribution to them. In the negotiations between the EU and Russia agreement was reached on charges for Siberian overflights at the EU-Russia Summit on 24 November 2006 in Helsinki. Moreover, on 12 December 2006 the Council agreed that the Commission should be authorised to commence talks with Ukraine on air transport.</p>
<p>On 11 December 2006 the Council adopted a common position on the Port State Control Directive, one of the proposals in the Third Maritime Safety Package. The Finnish Presidency drafted a review of the situation regarding a proposal for a directive on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea and inland waterways in the event of accidents. The review gives an account of the outcome of discussions on the proposal by competent bodies in the Council, and it was presented to the Council on 11 December 2006. The Presidency also initiated a debate on a proposal for a directive on compliance with flag state requirements.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will know that the Council submitted its common positions on the three legislative proposals contained in the third railway package to the European Parliament in September 2006. The Council is now awaiting Parliament’s opinions on the second reading of the proposals. With regard to the regulation on public passenger transport services, the Council intends to confirm its common position on public service obligations as soon as the legal and linguistic amendment to the political agreement has been finalised, after which it will be submitted to Parliament for second reading.</p>
<p>The Finnish Presidency has worked closely with the Commission and the Member States to promote the multi-agency Galileo Programme. Discussions on negotiating the licence agreement are under way. Significant progress has also been made in talks on the budgetary and financial mechanisms which the Community is to establish as part of the public and private sector partnership. In November in Helsinki, the Presidency held a workshop on matters of funding for transport and budget experts. At international level, a cooperation agreement was signed with South Korea and Morocco. Regarding regulation, let me say that on 12 December 2006 the Council adopted Council Regulations amending Council Regulation (EC) 876/2002 setting up the Galileo Joint Undertaking and Council Regulation (EC) 1321/2004 on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes.</p>
<p>The Finnish Presidency has also made significant headway with a decision on a location for the Galileo Supervisory Authority. The Member States now have a clear idea about the candidates and they all have at their disposal reference data on the candidacies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1051"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in December 2006.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the alarming news that some men who belong to the Arab minority in Iran are believed to be in immediate danger of being executed.</p>
<p>The EU has raised the matter with the Iranian Government and the head of the judiciary.</p>
<p>The European Union condemns the use of the death penalty and works to abolish it in all circumstances. In Iran’s case, the Council has condemned its use and, in particular, the rise in the number of executions. The EU is constantly taking up this and other urgent human rights issues directly with Iran and in international bodies, especially the United Nations. The EU supported the resolution by the UN General Assembly on the human rights situation in Iran, which was adopted by the Third Committee on 21 November 2006. It appealed to Iran to abolish in law and practice public and other executions, the carrying out of which contravenes internationally recognised safeguards. Furthermore, the Council has appealed to the Iranian authorities that all prisoners should be assured the possibility of legal assistance.</p>
<p>With regard to the Arab minority, the Council has raised the issue of discrimination against minorities living in Iran, including ethnic minorities, directly with Iran, though also via the UN. The UN resolution that I have referred to urges Iran to abolish in law and in practice all discrimination against minorities, such as the Arabs, so as to ensure that they have the same equal opportunities for education as all other Iranians and that these matters are dealt with openly in full cooperation with those minorities.</p>
<p>The Council continually monitors the human rights situation in Iran and regards it as regrettable that the human rights situation there, including that of minorities, has worsened. The Council has appealed to Iran on many occasions to ensure that its human rights obligations are implemented.</p>
<p>The Council had expected a round of talks on human rights between the EU and Iran, which was meant to take place in December. Despite the mutual agreement, Iran decided in the end not to engage in dialogue. The EU is still keen to start talks and is continually raising urgent human rights cases with the Iranian authorities, an example of which is the case now before us. In its relations with Iran, the EU still focuses its main attention on concerns over human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1052"></a>

<p>The 22<span class="sup">nd</span> round of the EU-China dialogue on human rights was held in Beijing on 19 October. At the meeting, special attention was paid to the fight against racism, freedom of speech and the reform of China’s criminal justice system. The answers to some key problems in China were partly unsatisfactory, especially regarding the ratification of the Internal Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the reform of the ‘Re-education Through Labour’ (RDL) system. Despite repeated requests, the timetable for ratifying the ICCPR is still not available. The EU urged China to continue cooperating with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and to implement his recommendations. There was a lengthy discussion on his visit and report.</p>
<p>The Council is still deeply concerned about the continuing restriction on freedom of speech in China, which extends to use of the internet, and it mentioned this to China as well. The EU also expressed its concern about the large number of defenders of human rights, lawyers and journalists in jail, and urged China not to harass or punish people who peacefully exercise their right to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>During the discussions, China presented in closer detail some of the advances it had made recently in the area of legal reform. It said that there had been results under the Chinese Supreme Court’s Second Five-Year Reform Plan in several areas. These included reforming the system of court adjudication committees and the system of criminal evidence, attempts to reform the prison system and extend the practice of individual investigations, improvements to the advisory and legal aid system, public hearings in cases where the death penalty is being considered in a court of second instance, sound or video recordings of hearings to prevent torture, avoidance of overlong detention periods through better supervision mechanisms and smoother reporting channels, the protection of farmers’ rights and improvements to legislation on the right to work, and the protection of the rights of vulnerable population groups, including opportunities for the partially abled and disabled for rehabilitation and work.</p>
<p>In the talks the EU raised several issues relating to UN mechanisms, including the possibility of enhancing the status of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in China. According to China, the UN Human Rights Council should work this year primarily to develop the new Council structures and not pass resolutions on individual countries.</p>
<p>Other matters discussed included the recent incident on China’s frontier with Nepal, when Chinese soldiers opened fire on a group of Tibetans who were trying to cross the border. The EU asked for an investigation and requested China to investigate the case thoroughly.</p>
<p>To support the dialogue, a legal seminar was once again organised between European and Chinese researchers. The work groups in the seminar examined issues connected with workers’ rights and access to information. Their recommendations were discussed in the official dialogue.</p>
<p>The next human rights dialogue round will be held during the German Presidency in spring 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1043"></a>

<p>(EN) In reply to the Honourable Member’s question concerning Commission Regulation 1281/2005 on the management of fishing licences and the information to be contained therein, the Commission would like to clarify its position.</p>
<p>Among the information to be contained in the licence, Member States have to include the main fishing gear and the secondary fishing gear, where the latter exists. It is, however, clear both from the title of the Regulation, as well as from the title of Article 5 and from the Annex to this regulation, that this information is the minimum information that is required by Community law. It, therefore, follows, that those Member States, whose fishermen are allowed to use more than two fishing gears, as it is the case with Greece, may include additional gears in the licence. There is no limitation on the number of additional gears to be included.</p>
<p>The regulation specifies that one gear has to be qualified as the main one, but it does not specify the criteria on the basis of which this is to be done by Member States. The latter are, therefore, free to define as main gear those which they consider to be the most important in terms of the fishing effort exerted or on the basis of other criteria. If all the gears used by a particular boat are considered equally important, any one of them may be reported as main gear. In any case the qualification of a gear as main gear has no fisheries management implications under Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its Green Paper<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> entitled 'Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union: a European vision for the oceans and seas' the Commission emphasises that a healthy marine environment can only be achieved if the most serious threat to it, most of which (80%) take the form of land-based pollution or operational discharges from vessels can be brought under control. A recent MEDPOL (Mediterranean Pollution Programme) report left no room for doubt that 'land-based sources' such as oil refineries, industrial effluent, fertilisers etc. are constantly increasing pollution levels in the Mediterranean, which is the recipient for millions of tonnes of toxic discharges each year (from 9400 factories, refineries etc.).</p>
<p>The third Euro-Mediterranean interministerial environmental meeting of 20 November 2006 in Cairo stressed the need for environmental protection of the Mediterranean coastline and inshore waters and for coordinated measures covering the entire Mediterranean.

What does it think of policies implemented to date and the results thereof? Does it agree that the existing European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) covering the twenty-five Member States, which is to be integrated into the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, should, in this context, be extended to include the Mediterranean partner countries also?

<p>(EN) The Green Paper on an EU Maritime Policy seeks, to examine the economic activities of Europeans operators which are linked to, or impact on, the oceans and seas, and the policies dealing with them, with a view to finding better ways of enabling Europeans to derive more – and sustainable – benefit from the oceans. We believe that Europe should look at the oceans and seas in a holistic and cross-cutting manner, thus eventually stimulating growth and jobs in accordance with the Lisbon agenda in a sustainable manner and one that ensures the protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p>A Maritime Policy is important if we are to act decisively and preserve, the resource base upon which all maritime economic activities are built. This means that we have to ensure that the development of ocean uses and maritime activities do not undermine the marine environment. In this context, it is also worth nothing that the Commission has recently put forward a Marine Thematic Strategy, including a proposal for legislative action. This Strategy is one of the pillars upon which any maritime policy for the Union must rest and this principle has been made clear in the Green Paper. Furthermore, the recently adopted Third Maritime Safety Package is expected to make a substantial contribution to maritime safety, thus securing the marine environment from pollutant activities of vessels.</p>
<p>European policies on the marine environment need a general framework within which to operate, and at the same time implementation of such policies will need to take account of the realities of Europe’s geographical situation. The Thematic Strategy for the Marine Environment proposes an ecosystem-based regional planning. It encourages Member States to cooperate within the framework of Marine Regional Conventions which, in the Mediterranean basin, is that laid down by the Barcelona Convention. In addition, the Green Paper underlines that, where appropriate, Member States should use existing regional organisations whose activities impact on maritime activities, such as the Barcelona Process for the Mediterranean. Moreover, it points out the need for joint cooperation between Member States and non-EU countries for developing and implementing strategies at regional level.</p>
<p>This is of particular importance to the Mediterranean basin. The Mediterranean Action Plan has contributed to the development of the Marine Thematic Strategy, and, as a confirmation of the necessity for enhanced cooperation, a EURO-MED workshop on the Green Paper is currently planned for the first semester of 2007 with the aim to identify problems and stimulate a dialogue between maritime related actors in an integrated manner.</p>
<p>The policies and measures regarding the protection of the marine environment are many. On the one hand, given the complexity of the marine environment itself and of the human activities impacting upon it, a shift towards holistic and integrated policies is needed. On the other hand, when causes of concern have been identified and assessed, there is no reason to delay the definition and the implementation of adequate policies and measures tackling them in specific areas.</p>
<p>Thus, the holistic approach adopted in both the Marine Strategy and the Green Paper aim at abolishing the current fragmentation among the different maritime policy areas, which makes it difficult to comprehend the potential impact of one set of activities upon others. Hence, for instance, the fact that almost 80% of ocean pollution results from land-based human activities means not only that ocean problems can not be viewed in isolation from one another, but they also cannot continue to be viewed in isolation from what happens on land or in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean context, the Annex<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to the Commission Communication establishing an environment strategy for the Mediterranean<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> stated that whilst the Horizon 2020 initiative will pursue pollution reduction projects in the 3 priority sectors<a href="#defann_27_4" name="refann_27_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> responsible for up to 80% of the pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, "other pollution such as that originating from ships should also be addressed as soon as possible."</p>
<p>To streamline efforts at the national level, a common harmonised database of major pollution sources would be of importance for further evaluations, impact assessments and decision-making in the Mediterranean area. A big part of the pollution emitted into the Mediterranean Sea is already reported under the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) and, beginning in 2007, under the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR), which implements the UNECE<a href="#defann_27_5" name="refann_27_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> PRTR Protocol. Apart from the EU Member States, Croatia and Albania will in future report according to the the UNECE PRTR Protocol. Other partner countries are not bound by EU or UNECE provisions and are therefore not obliged to report according to the provisions of the European PRTR/UNECE PRTR Protocol. Given the advantages of a common harmonised database they should however be encouraged to do so on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>The importance of co-operation with the Mediterranean countries is duly taken into account in the Green paper on EU Maritime Policy. The already existing cooperation, however, needs to be underlined as well.</p>
<p>In this respect, attention has to be given to co-operation with REMPEC<a href="#defann_27_6" name="refann_27_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, a UNEP<a href="#defann_27_7" name="refann_27_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>/IMO<a href="#defann_27_8" name="refann_27_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> body responsible for the implementation of the maritime related part of the Barcelona Convention and, in particular, to the SAFEMED<a href="#defann_27_9" name="refann_27_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> project, a multi-country 3 year assistance project under the MEDA programme, which started in January 2006. SAFEMED aims to bridge the gap between the implementation of the international IMO rules on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships by the non EU Mediterranean countries and the implementation of these rules by the EU Member States on the basis of an important set of EU Regulations and Directives.</p>
<p>The Euro-Mediterranean Process also offers the possibility to pursue cooperation at regional level and such collaboration is already underway between environment ministries and there are now also annual meetings of the Euro-Mediterranean Water Directors. Whilst under Euro-Mediterranean cooperation no specific mechanism is foreseen for shipping, integration of environmental concerns into other sectors is one of the basic aims of the Euro-Mediterranean process. The conclusions of the Foreign Ministers' meeting in Tampere on 27/28 November 2006 "underline the importance of integration of environmental concerns into other relevant sectors in order to contribute to the development of sustainable production and consumption across the region."</p>
<p>It should be also noted that the activities carried out under SMAP III (i.e. the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> Regional Environment Programme for the Mediterranean), support measures have been put into place in order to help Mediterranean Partner countries to improve their efforts towards integrating environmental considerations into their national policies and strategies in a wide range of sectors. Integrated coastal zone management is also encouraged through a number of concrete demonstration projects. Both types of actions should contribute to addressing the overriding issue of the protection of the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<p>EU institutional coordination mechanisms exist for the development of all policies, not just those related to shipping, and will continue to be used. With this in mind and given that a number of Mediterranean partners have strong maritime interests, cooperation with these partners in the form of a coordinated Maritime Affairs dialogue is in the EU's interest, particularly in the context of the development of an integrated approach to Maritime Affairs in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The basis for this is the scientific advice on the status of the stocks and the respective catch options that can be foreseen as being sustainable.

<p>An increase of the Lithuanian fishing quota is therefore only possible if the status of the stocks allows for an overall increase in the Community TAC. For the Baltic, the October Council has increased the overall catch options for 2007.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Hellenic Court of Auditors ruled on 8 November 2006 that the civil courts were not competent to determine the nature of an employment relationship and, therefore, did not accept final decisions in favour of workers converting their contracts into contracts of indefinite duration. This decision quashes final judgments handed down by courts of higher instance in favour of the workers and renders futile any appeal by workers to the Greek courts in pursuance of the application of Directive 1999/70/EC<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has stressed in Case C-212/04 that, pursuant to Directive 1999/70/EC, 'the application of national legislation which, in the public sector alone, prohibits absolutely the conversion into an employment contract of indefinite duration of a succession of fixed-term contracts that, in fact, have been intended to cover ‘fixed and permanent needs’ constitutes an abuse. Does the Commission, therefore, consider that the decision of the Hellenic Court of Auditors, which essentially removes workers' legal protection, is consistent with the principles of the European Union?</p>
<p>What measures will the Commission take to ensure that this decision, which contravenes the letter and the spirit of Directive 1999/70/EC, is reversed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 1999/70/EC on fixed-term work<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> requires Member States to adopt measures to prevent abuse of successive fixed-term contracts. Member States, however, are not required to convert fixed-term contracts into open-ended contracts as long as there are other effective measures to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>It follows that the refusal of the Greek audit authority to execute court decisions on conversion of fixed-term contracts into open-ended contracts does not in itself imply a failure to apply the Directive. However, if the general courts in Greece have found that the only effective remedy available in a particular case is the conversion of the fixed-term contract, the refusal to execute such a decision would raise an issue as regards the application of Directive 1999/70/EC insofar as the a case is covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining the recent developments in this matter and may, for this purpose, have to ask the Greek authorities for further information. Such an examination will enable the Commission to make an informed assessment of the system put in place in Greece in order to ensure application and enforcement of the national legislation transposing Directive 1999/70/EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 23 December 2004, the Commission adopted the document concerning the first phase of consultation of the social partners on violence at work, under Article 138(2) of the Treaty. This consultation aimed to gauge the opinion of the social partners on the protection of workers’ health and safety against all forms of violence at work, including psychological harassment.</p>
<p>In response to this consultation, the social partners have informed the Commission of their intention to launch a negotiation process with a view to negotiating a voluntary agreement at European level in this area.

<p>The Commission will examine all the issues arising from the negotiation process between the social partners, and, where appropriate, the results of introducing any agreement at European level, before deciding whether other initiatives are needed in this area.</p>

<p>The Swedish media have reported that disabled elite athletes risk being adversely affected by the EU directive on working time (2003/88/EC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). That directive stipulates that an employee is entitled to at least 11 hours' rest per 24-hour period and a minimum uninterrupted rest period of 36 hours per week. In order to meet these requirements, a disabled person needs three personal assistants to carry out a week's training, which entails considerable additional costs, particularly if the training takes place abroad. The Swedish Minister for Employment, Sven Otto Littorin, has stressed that he will try to find a solution whereby disabled people are not adversely affected by the directive on working time. The Swedish Municipal Workers' Union is resigned to the fact and claims that there is nothing it can do to avoid the directive adversely affecting disabled athletes.</p>

<p>(EN) It is not possible to comment on the exact requirements of the Working Time Directive as regards the specific situation of personal assistants required to provide support to professional disabled athletes travelling abroad, without more detailed information than is provided by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>In general terms, the Working Time Directive<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> sets out minimum requirements to protect the health and safety of workers, particularly against the health risks which can arise from excessive working hours. Among these are the requirements for a minimum of 11 consecutive hours' rest in each 24 hours and for 24 hours' uninterrupted rest in each 7 days.</p>
<p>The Directive allows for derogations from these requirements in a range of situations. These include three which might be relevant to the situation mentioned by the Honourable Member: derogations by collective agreements, or where a worker is working at a distance from their residence or normal workplace, or in activities which require continuity of service. Such derogations are subject to the Directive's overall requirement of ensuring compensatory rest periods sufficient to avoid fatigue which risks causing injury to fellow-workers or to others, or causing injury or short- or long-term health damage to the worker concerned.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice has interpreted the Directive, notably in Jaeger, C-151/02, as requiring two further conditions which could be relevant in the situation mentioned by the Honourable Member. Firstly, any time spent on call at a place dictated by the employer may not be taken into account in calculating rest periods, even if the worker is not actively working during the whole of the on-call period. Secondly, compensatory rest breaks in the context of derogations must, according to the Court, be taken 'immediately after' the working time which they are supposed to counter-act.</p>
<p>The Directive does refer to situations where it is objectively impossible to provide compensatory rest breaks, in which case alternative protective measures could be substituted. Depending on the facts, this provision might allow for flexible arrangements in the situation mentioned by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the Directive's legal requirements in situations such as that raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission made a legislative proposal in 2004<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> to amend the Working Time Directive. Under the Commission's proposal<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, only active on-call time would be considered as effective working time, and compensatory rest breaks would not need to immediately follow the period worked, but would follow within a reasonable period to be determined by national legislation, by collective agreement or by agreement of the social partners. The Commission regrets that the Council has so far been unable to reach agreement on this legislative proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not share the interpretation given by the Honourable Member to the compromise of the Finnish Presidency. As far as the Commission is concerned, the Finnish Presidency's proposal constituted a solid basis for a compromise in that it recognised the exceptional nature of the opt-out and defined strict conditions to the use of the opt-out.</p>
<p>Regarding daily and weekly working time in the Working Time Directive, the compromise always maintained the existing limits (including a minimum of 11 hours' continuous rest per day and a maximum average working week of 48 hours including overtime) and there was never any suggestion that these would be changed under the Presidency's proposal.</p>
<p>Regarding the opt-out, the Commission's report in 2003<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> already noted the negative impact of long working hours on health and safety and concluded that the opt-out 'could put at risk' workers' protection. It also noted that there were difficulties in practice in ensuring that real guarantees were provided for opted-out workers. The Commission's amended proposal, moreover, proposed that the opt-out would no longer be available after a three year period, unless Member States could secure the Commission's agreement to extension for specified reasons. Nevertheless, in the very lengthy negotiations in Council to date, it has not proved possible to secure any agreement in favour of clearly phasing out the opt-out.</p>
<p>The Commission does not intend to propose legislation to reduce average working time to a maximum of 35 hours per week. Such measures may, of course, be adopted by collective agreements or by national legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Regarding the opt-out, the Commission's report in 2003<a href="#defann_34_3" name="refann_34_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> already noted the negative impact of long working hours on health and safety and concluded that the opt-out 'could put at risk' workers' protection. It also noted that there were difficulties in practice in ensuring that real guarantees were provided for opted-out workers.</p>
<p>The Commission's amended proposal of 31 May 2005<a href="#defann_34_4" name="refann_34_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> proposed a number of guarantees for opt-out workers, aimed at reducing or preventing such negative impact. It also proposed that the opt-out would no longer be available after a three year period, unless Member States could secure the Commission's agreement to extension for specified reasons. Nevertheless, in the very lengthy negotiations in Council to date, it has not proved possible to secure any agreement in favour of clearly phasing out the opt-out.</p>
<p>Regarding on-call time, the Commission recalls that the European social partners were consulted twice on the present revision of the Working Time Directive, but did not indicate their wish to resolve these issues by themselves concluding an agreement. The Commission's amended proposal, nevertheless, would afford an extensive role to collective agreements, or agreements between the social partners at national level, regarding the treatment of on-call time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Alcohol-related harm is a key pubic health concern across Europe. In fact, reducing the harmful use of alcohol across the EU would contribute to the European Council’s Lisbon objective of more Healthy Life Years for All.</p>
<p>Although most Member States have taken actions in this respect, the level is still unacceptably high. Harmful alcohol consumption is estimated to be responsible for almost 200 000 deaths each year – alcohol is responsible for 25 % of deaths of young men between 15 and 29.</p>
<p>Article 152 clearly gives the Community the competence and responsibility to support Member States to reduce alcohol-related harm. According to Article 152, the Community has the obligation to contribute to the achievements of the public health objectives and furthermore, Community action should complement national policies and be directed towards improving public health, preventing human illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to human health. This has been the guiding principle in the EU’s public health work on alcohol.</p>
<p>The Commission has, on 24 October, adopted a Communication on a European strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm.</p>
<p>The Communication examines the issue of reducing alcohol related harm comprehensively, while at the same time being clear about the roles and limits of competence of different actors. The Commission’s main contribution will be to complement national strategies, encourage cooperation and coordination between Member States, to facilitate the dissemination of good practice across the EU.</p>
<p>The Communication covers five priority themes: protecting children and adolescents, addressing drink driving, preventing harm among adults and at the workplace, information, and building the evidence base.</p>
<p>In order to implement the strategy, the Commission intends to create an Alcohol and Health Forum by June 2007, to support, provide input and monitor the implementation of the strategy. This would include and engage both Member States and stakeholders. Moreover, the Commission will set up a group of stakeholders for co-operation on responsible commercial communication and sales.</p>
<p>The Commission is now looking forward to discussing the Communication with Parliament and its position on it. The Council adopted during the EPSCO<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Council of 30 November very supportive Conclusions.</p>

<p>(EN) The recently published World Health Organisation (WHO) action plan, referred to by the Honourable Member, identifies 3 main mechanisms to increase vaccine supply:</p>
<p>Developing a policy to increase the demand for seasonal vaccines,</p>
<p>Increasing the influenza vaccine production capacity,</p>
<p>Promoting research and development for influenza vaccines.</p>
<p>In April 2005, the Commission published a position paper called ‘Towards sufficiency of pandemic influenza vaccines in the EU’<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> outlining a public-private partnership between the public sector and the vaccine industry. One of the proposed public sector contributions is a firm commitment by all EU Member States to increase seasonal influenza vaccine coverage in line with World Health Assembly Resolution 56.19. This resolution recommends influenza vaccination coverage of 75% of people at risk by 2010.</p>
<p>In a resolution adopted in 2005, the Parliament also urged the Member States to increase the vaccination coverage in line with the World Health Assembly Resolution.</p>
<p>The Commission is pleased to inform the Honourable Member that many Member States have in the meantime increased, and continue to increase, their seasonal influenza vaccination coverage.</p>
<p>With regard to increasing production capacity, the Commission has signed a contract for a project that undertakes concrete actions in the framework of a public-private partnership. The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has also developed guidelines for industry on new technologies that boost production capacity.</p>
<p>In addition, projects on research and development of new influenza vaccines and on increasing production capacity are funded by the Commission via the Framework Programme. In the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, €16 million extended by another €28.3 million were spent on projects in the area of avian and pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>The proposed public support to industry as outlined in the public-private partnership could potentially save 2 – 3 months in having a vaccine available for public use.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Medicines agency (EMEA) has established a procedure for fast track approval of pandemic vaccines as well as a fee waiver for the submissions of such registration dossiers.</p>
<p>On the measures that the Member States have taken to protect their citizens in the event of a pandemic, the Commission is pleased to see that all EU Member States have in the meantime developed a national pandemic preparedness and response plan. Careful preparedness and response planning as well as interoperability of the national plans are of key importance in protecting EU citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission is working closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO Europe in assessing national pandemic preparedness plans through country visits.</p>
<p>Both Romania and Bulgaria have pandemic influenza preparedness plans. As already done for the majority of the EU-25 Member States' plans, ECDC is planning assessment visits to Romania and Bulgaria (second half of 2007) to ensure interoperability and to identify any gaps that may exist.</p>
<p>In addition, Member States are stockpiling antivirals as a first line of defence before pandemic vaccines become available. Most countries will reach their target antivirals coverage by the first quarter of 2007.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is clear that the Commission, together with all the stakeholders, has been pro-actively pursuing the recommendations identified in WHO’s action plan. The Commission maintains a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. As the influenza pandemic virus knows no national borders, the Commission’s initiatives aim at coordinating the Member States’ actions to optimally protect their citizens in the event of a pandemic.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Non-profit-making associations and churches in Sweden have expressed their concern that, in practice, the EU's new Regulation (EC) No 852/2004<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on foodstuffs means that they must bake bread and cakes in inspected and approved kitchens and be subject to controls by food inspectors. I have previously tabled a question (<a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2006-3868_EN.html">P-3868/06</a>) to the Commission concerning the Swedish authorities' application of the regulation on foodstuffs. The Commission's answer does not make the situation entirely clear. The Commission notes that premises where food is handled, prepared, stored or served occasionally and on a small scale are not subject to the requirements of the regulation on foodstuffs. The interpretation of the terms 'occasionally' and 'on a small scale' is therefore crucial in determining whether an activity is allowed or not. The Commission stresses that it is a matter for the national authorities to interpret these terms. The Commission's interpretation, however, takes precedence over that of Member States' national authorities. The Swedish National Food Administration considers that an activity should be regarded as continuous (and therefore covered by the regulation on foodstuffs) if it is carried out more than a few times a year.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that to be the correct interpretation? Can the Commission say in plain language whether a church or non-profit-making association which sells bread and cakes to the general public every week may continue with that activity without having to comply with the extensive requirements laid down in the foodstuffs regulation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very concerned about the high number of suicides in the EU and the fact that suicide rates in some Member States are among the highest in the world.</p>
<p>In its Green paper “Improving the mental health of the population. Towards a strategy on mental health for the EU” of 2005, the Commission put much emphasis on suicide. At present, the Commission is working on a strategy on mental health. This strategy could include actions to combat suicidal behaviour. The adoption of the strategy is planned for spring 2007.</p>
<p>Under the Programme of Community Action in the field of Public Health (2003-2008), the Commission is co-financing a project “European Alliance Against Depression”. This project is now in its second phase. It is implemented in regions in 31 countries including Member States and accession countries. The project approach is to build up regional networks against depression. In a previous pilot phase in a German region the project was able to significantly reduce the rate of suicide attempts. Further information about this project is available on the following website: www.eaad.net.</p>
<p>Recently the Commission adopted a Communication setting out a strategy to support Members States in combating the harmful effects of alcohol, “An EU strategy to support Members States in reducing alcohol related harm”. The Commission would see this initiative as a contribution to combating suicide.</p>
<p>Under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (RTD) (2002-2006), the Commission is financing several projects that will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of suicidal behaviour, as they cover basic and clinical research on mood disorders and alcohol addiction.

<p>The EU's new strategy on mental health, presented in a Green Paper, is important for all the Member States. However, it is twice or even three times as important for the new Member States and the applicant countries. In that part of Europe, mental health indicators paint a disheartening picture: it is still standard practice to invest not in bodies and services whose aim is to improve welfare, but rather in practices which perpetuate traditions of stigmatisation, discrimination and social exclusion inherited from the past. Escaping this vicious circle calls for determined political action and investment in new areas. Some Member States are determined to employ just that approach: for example, Lithuania has made preparations and its parliament is currently in the process of adopting a new national strategy on mental health.</p>
<p>The transition from a statement of new political objectives to practical action will be a very difficult one. How could the European Union, and in particular the Commission, contribute to the process of fundamental change in the new Member States? Would it not make sense to provide even more detailed information about the need for new, high-quality investment in order to cope with the challenges associated with mental health? What mental health-related problems in the new EU Member States does the Commission regard as most important, and what specific forms of investment is it recommending, in the light of these countries' increasing prosperity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member's question refers to the Commission’s Green paper “Improving the mental health of the population. Towards a strategy on mental health for the EU” of October 2005. This was in fact a consultation document. Currently, the Commission services are drawing the conclusions from the successful consultation. Hopefully, a follow-up Communication setting out a mental health strategy for action at Community level can be adopted in spring of 2007.</p>
<p>There are some particularly pressing challenges in the field of mental health in some new Member States and applicant countries. In many populations, suicide and alcohol consumption rates are at rather high levels. The living and care conditions for people with mental health problems are sometimes unacceptable.</p>
<p>Governments should address these issues as a priority. The Commission therefore very much welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Government of Lithuania and others.</p>
<p>The key element of reforms should clearly be the move from institution-based mental health systems towards community based systems.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot prescribe solutions, but it can and will continue to facilitate and support change through providing information, promoting the exchange between countries and offering support to them through the Commission’s own policy instruments. For instance, new Member States could request funding for investment into mental health from the health-priority of the Structural Funds. They can also participate in projects under Community action programmes, such as the Public Health Programme (2003-2008). A good example is a project “Child and Adolescent Mental Health in enlarged Europe. Development of effective policies and practices”, which is led by experts from a new Member State (State Mental Health Centre, Lithuania).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1011"></a>

<p>(EN) Directive 2002/46/CE of the Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to food supplements, provides for the Commission to adopt via comitology the maximum and minimum amounts of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>
<p>In the absence of such harmonised rules, the maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals in food supplements remain regulated by national rules. These rules vary significantly across the Member States.</p>
<p>Such a divergent situation has inevitably caused problems in relation to the free circulation of products within the European market, created unequal conditions of competition and, in some cases, limiting consumer choice for these products.</p>
<p>Work has already started in order to address these problems, and in line with the provisions contained in the above mentioned Directive, the Commission has launched the exercise which aims to establish maximum permitted amounts of vitamins and minerals in these products.</p>
<p>Given this complex situation and the importance of the exercise, the first step of this process has been the publication of a discussion paper where the Commission has identified the issues to be considered and requested the input of all interested parties. The consultation closed on 30 September 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently analysing the answers received. On the basis of these contributions it is going to evaluate the best way forward for this exercise.</p>
<p>The principle of safety, which lies at the heart of all EU legislation, is its guiding principle in this exercise.</p>

<p>(EN) In May 2006 the Commission presented a modified proposal for a new Health Programme to run from 2007 to 2013. This has a total budget of € 365 million.</p>
<p>The proposal was designed to ensure that the programme was adapted to the budgetary agreement on the new financial framework that allocated a much smaller health budget than foreseen.</p>
<p>It also incorporates into the programme the main concerns of the Parliament (expressed in its Opinion of March 2006, during first reading).</p>
<p>The modified proposal has 3 focuses – health security, health promotion, and knowledge and information.</p>
<p>The first objective of the programme is to improve health security in the EU. Here the Commission plans actions to protect citizens against health threats. This includes developing capacity to respond to a cross-border threat, for example from communicable diseases, by strengthening health emergency planning and preparedness measures. In addition, this security objective includes actions related to patient safety, risk assessment and Community legislation on blood, tissues and cells.</p>
<p>The second objective is to promote health in the EU. The programme would take forward action on the determinants of health, such as nutrition, alcohol, tobacco and drug consumption, as well as social and environmental factors. This objective would also include measures to address health inequalities, with a particular emphasis on the newer Member States, and action to promote healthy ageing. These are two key issues underlined by the Parliament. The Commission would continue action in areas such as injuries and accidents and on prevention of major diseases.</p>
<p>The third objective is to generate and disseminate health knowledge. The Commission proposes to continue work to develop health indicators and tools and ways of disseminating information to citizens. In addition, it will be putting an emphasis on exchange of knowledge in key areas, such as children’s health or rare diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that, even with a smaller budget than in its initial proposal, the health programme will make an important contribution to improving health across the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1021"></a>

<p>Despite the fact that many species can now be bred in captivity, the 25 Member States of the EU are the largest consumers of wild birds taken from their natural habitat.

The USA has already banned commercial imports of wild birds. The EU bans the export of our own bird life, but paradoxically is responsible for the extraction of hundreds of thousands of birds from the wild for importation each year, which raises serious animal welfare questions, as the mortality rates for these captured birds are frighteningly high.

<p>(EN) The Commission on 25 April 2005 requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to prepare a Scientific Opinion on the animal health and welfare risks associated with captive bird imports. This Opinion was adopted by EFSA on 27 October 2006.</p>
<p>The Opinion identifies a number of ways in which the provisions for captive bird imports can be improved so as to significantly reduce any risk posed to animal health in the EU.</p>
<p>Based on the EFSA Opinion, the Commission intends to amend the entire set of provisions for captive bird imports, including quarantine requirements, laid down in Decision 2000/666/EC.</p>
<p>Because this Scientific Opinion will guide the future policy of the EU on the animal health and welfare aspects of these imports, it is important to properly assess the scientific input received by the Commission.</p>
<p>In the light of the current world animal health situation regarding avian influenza the restrictions provided for in Dec. 2005/760/EC have been prolonged for a transitional period in order to allow the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States to finalise this evaluation and to prepare the measures to be laid down.</p>
<p>This ban was first adopted in October 2005 as part of the EU preventive measures against avian influenza in third countries.</p>
<p>However, the aim is to ensure that the new measures are adopted and enforced in early 2007.</p>
<p>A Commission proposal to prolong until 31 March 2007 the EU ban on all imports of live captive birds was presented to the Member States at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 1 December 2006 as they requested more time to examine the Scientific Opinion and discuss the measures to be adopted.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully agrees with the Honourable Member about the seriousness of the rising prevalence of obesity in our society. It is of great concern to the Commission that prevalence is rising so markedly among children.</p>
<p>The Commission believes it is essential that more is done to address it, and for this reason it is planning to publish its proposals next year in the form of a White Paper on Nutrition and Physical Activity.</p>
<p>The Green Paper process on “Promoting Healthy Diets and Physical Activity” was an important element in the development of our approach.</p>
<p>Of particular interest was where there was consensus from respondents. Such as:</p>
<p>the urgent need to do more to protect children,</p>
<p>a European approach should be comprehensive and inclusive of a range of actions across a number of sectors.</p>
<p>The analysis of responses, which can be accessed on Commission's websites, is also an excellent source of ideas.</p>
<p>Perhaps predictably, however, there was little consensus among respondents to the Green Paper about the appropriate mix of self regulatory actions and mandatory legislation.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member refers to the issue of the advertising of foods to children on television. The Commission believes that advertising, among other elements of our environment, has an influence on the diet of children.</p>
<p>It is the Commission's view that society should aim for a situation where the diet that is marketed or advertised reflects the balanced, healthy diet. The Commission also believes that the marketing and advertising industries have a role to play in developing an environment where foods are advertised responsibly.</p>
<p>This is why self regulatory mechanisms should be tested, and given a chance to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is only if self regulatory approaches are not proving to be effective that legislation should be considered after due consideration of the economic impact thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1047"></a>

<p>(EN) Diabetes is a major public health scourge in the European Union, and in developed countries more generally. The epidemic of type II diabetes we are seeing today is closely connected to changes in lifestyles – nutrition and diet, lack of physical activity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Austria has made diabetes prevention a key priority in its Presidency and has organised a major conference on its prevention. Subsequently, in June last year, the Council adopted conclusion which embedded the diabetes issue in a broader health determinants approach.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Commission is discussing with organisations in the area how best to take forward work on identifying good practice in diabetes prevention. Just recently, the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection sent a representative to a major conference organized by the International Diabetes Federation in Warsaw, through whom he expressed his support to the ongoing work to tackle Type 2 Diabetes. However, no announcement was made from the Commission on bringing forward a Recommendation on diabetes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission appreciates the initiative by Bangladesh for designating the current World Diabetes Day, 14 November, as a United Nations (UN) World Diabetes Day. The proposed resolution also encourages Member States to develop national policies for the prevention, treatment and care of diabetes in line with the sustainable development of their health care systems as outlined in internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>For its part, regarding the key determinants of diabetes, the Commission is planning to publish next year a White Paper on Nutrition and Physical Activity. The Commission would also like to refer the Honourable Member to its recent Communication on alcohol-related harm, and its solid track record in smoking prevention. The Commission believes that this will constitute a key contribution in particular to the prevention of Type 2 Diabetes.</p>
<p>In the mean time the Commission will continue to provide support to projects from the Public Health and Research Programmes and will pursue with Member States how best to support their efforts in developing their national strategies to counter diabetes.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (RTD) (2007 – 2013), research into diabetes is planned to focus on aetiologies of the different types of diabetes, and their related prevention and treatment. Special attention will be given to juvenile diseases and factors operating in childhood.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0957"></a>

<p>According to a major piece of journalism which made the front page of the Portuguese newspaper Público on 26 November 2006, children (or families with children) are widely banned from Portuguese hotels.

<p>Does the Commission not regard such a practice as humanly and socially shocking and as contrary to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights (as proclaimed at Nice), and does it not think that urgent action should be taken at European level under Article 13 of the Treaty, which allows action to be taken against discrimination on the grounds of age?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Article 18 of the EC Treaty grants every Union citizen the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaty and in the measures adopted to give it effect. Article 49 of the EC Treaty prohibits restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Community in respect of nationals of Member States who are established in a State of the Community other than that of the person for whom the services are intended. This freedom includes the freedom for the recipients of services, such as tourists, to go to another Member State in order to receive a service without being obstructed by restrictions.</p>
<p>Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States provides that beneficiaries of this Directive are entitled to equal treatment with nationals within the scope of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The fact that certain private entities such as hotels or restaurants do not admit children, as part of their commercial policy, cannot be considered as an obstacle to free movement nor as discrimination on grounds of nationality forbidden by the EC Treaty and by Directive 2004/38/EC.</p>

The Directive prohibits discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief. This Directive only applies in the employment and vocational training field, and does not cover access to goods and services such as hotels or restaurants.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the threats faced by the EU's marine biodiversity and has recently made a number of proposals to tackle them.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member recalls the Commission Communication "Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 — and beyond. Sustaining ecosystem services for human well-being"<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, adopted earlier this year and which is accompanied by an Action Plan.</p>
<p>As regards fisheries pressures, one of the priorities identified by the Commission in the above Communication is to take full advantage of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy to ensure sustainable management of fish stocks and prevent fishing activities from harming the marine environment on which their sustainability depends. Given the magnitude of present fisheries pressures, halting the deterioration of fish stocks is in fact a precondition if the European Union is to fulfil its commitment to halt biodiversity loss by 2010. Of key importance is the enforcement of Community fishing management measures and, in particular, the definition of better means to tackle Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing. As marine biodiversity cannot be healthy unless commercial fish stocks are healthy, further integrating environmental concerns into fisheries policy remains essential.</p>
<p>The proposed Thematic Strategy on the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment adopted by the Commission in October 2005<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, on which the Parliament completed its first reading on 14 November 2006 on the basis of a report from the Environment Committee prepared by Ms Lienemann and an opinion from the Fisheries prepared by the Honourable Member, will make an essential contribution to the more effective protection of Europe's marine environment. The EU Marine Strategy will act as an important environmental integration tool for all activities affecting the marine environment – including of course fisheries.</p>
<p>As pointed out by the Honourable Member in his question, fisheries are not the only pressure on the marine environment. There are a number of other pressures affecting the marine environment and its biodiversity ranging from coastal development, agriculture, shipping to tourism or oil and gas exploration. Pollution from both land-based and maritime sources undoubtedly contributes to the deterioration of the marine environment and should therefore be addressed.</p>
<p>The proposed Marine Strategy Directive will ensure that the marine environment is fully protected from the harmful effects of pressures affecting it. The proposed Marine Strategy Directive will complement existing EC water legislation, thus completing the full water cycle from inland to marine waters.</p>
<p>With respect to the specific question on the Black Sea, the Commission shares the Honourable Member's concerns about worrying environmental degradation trends in the region.</p>
<p>These trends result in particular from the combined impact of pollution, over-fishing, coastal degradation and the introduction of non autochthonous species. Many of the attendant environmental problems, such as eutrophication or the deterioration of marine living resources, have an obvious trans-boundary dimension and require concerted action in order to be tackled effectively. The Commission is actively supporting international action and efforts for the conservation of the marine environment in the Black Sea and since 2002 the Commission has coordinated the preparation of investment projects to remedy the environmental situation in the region under the DABLAS (Danube-Black Sea) Initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission's efforts to enhance protection of the marine environment in the Black Sea will of course take a new course with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the coming months. Upon accession, the Black Sea will become a sea bordered by Member States of the EU and thus the obligations of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive will be extended to this marine region. The Parliament indeed proposed to include the Black Sea among the Marine Regions to which the proposed Directive would apply. Achieving a high level of protection of the marine environment in the Black Sea will be a challenge. The Commission will do its utmost, in cooperation with countries in the region, to deliver this objective.</p>
<p>A first, essential step which we are exploring at the moment is the possibility of becoming a contracting party to the "Convention on the protection of the Black Sea against pollution" which at present constitutes an adequate regional platform for cooperation on the protection of marine biodiversity in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Improving the environment will be a key priority for the 2007-2013 cohesion policy programming period, as well as for the current Structural and Cohesion Fund programming period.</p>
<p>Waste management is explicitly listed among the priorities of the ‘convergence’ objective. Better access to networks and to cross-border waste management facilities is also one of the priorities of the ‘European territorial cooperation’ objective (cross-border section). Finally, the Cohesion Fund will provide significant support for waste management projects in the eligible Member States.</p>
<p>Particular attention will be paid to areas with geographical or natural handicaps, such as islands, in the next programming period. Article 10 of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of 5 July 2006<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> stipulates that the ERDF may contribute towards the financing of investments aimed at improving accessibility, promoting and developing economic activities related to cultural and natural heritage, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources and encouraging sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>Over the same period, the outermost regions will benefit from a specific additional ERDF allocation in order to offset the additional costs linked to the handicaps of these regions, as recognised by Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty. Article 11 of the ERDF regulation stipulates that this allocation will enable the ERDF to intervene in order to co-finance investment expenditure, limited to 50% of the total allocation granted, and, for the first time within the framework of cohesion policy, to co-finance operating expenditure linked to the additional costs incurred by public and private enterprises, and financial compensation linked to performing public service obligations. Waste processing forms an integral part of the areas of eligiblity covered by the aforementioned Article 11.</p>
<p>In order to support the competent authorities in their efforts to plan and organise waste management on islands, the Commission has published a specific manual on this subject, entitled ‘Codes of practice for waste management on islands’, which is available on their website: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/publications/pdf/manual_waste_mgt_islands.pdf.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Tooth whitening kits are generally to be considered as cosmetic products in the sense of Council Directive 76/768/EEC. As such, they must respect the requirements laid down by this directive. Indeed, the Cosmetics directive currently requires that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide cannot be in higher than 0.1%. This concentration was fixed in 1992 on the basis of an opinion of the scientific committee responsible for cosmetic products, which considered that concentrations at this level posed no risk to human health.</p>
<p>The possibility to use hydrogen peroxide in higher concentrations in cosmetic tooth whitening products has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP). In March 2005, the scientific committee delivered an opinion<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that considered tooth whitening products with hydrogen peroxide content up to 0.1 % safe, while those with hydrogen peroxide content between 0.1-6% are considered safe if used after consultation with and approval of the consumer's dentist. Following from this, the Commission entered discussions with Member States and stakeholders on how to implement this opinion. However, the Commission has been recently informed of the existence of new data which had not been evaluated by the Scientific Committee. Therefore, the Commission’s adoption of the draft Directive which was discussed with Member States has been postponed.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that all necessary guarantees in the matter of health protection are taken, the Commission is in the process of requesting the scientific committee to evaluate this new evidence. If, taking into consideration this new evaluation, the Commission considers that the proposed modification of the Cosmetics Directive needs to be amended, a new proposal will be drafted and will be presented to Member States. Parliament will be informed in the framework of the right of scrutiny.</p>

<p>(EN) It is correct that, at the 2006 EU-China Summit in Helsinki, the Chinese Government announced its intention to create a programme of scholarships to enable European students to undertake training in the Chinese language.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific budgetary resources for the provision of similar training for EU students, and this Chinese initiative is in fact seen as a demonstration of China's appreciation for the scholarships that are awarded to Chinese students for postgraduate training courses in EU universities under the Erasmus Mundus programme, and the specific Erasmus Mundus 'China Window' which is financed under the EU-China co-operation programme.</p>
<p>This being said, the Managers Exchange Training Programme (with EC financing of €17.2 million - also from the EU-China co-operation programme) will provide Chinese language and business culture training to some 200 EU managers (age group 26-45), expected to come from small and medium sized enterprises, over the five-year period from 2006 to 2010.</p>
<p>Language training apart, exchanges with China in the field of higher education take place in several ways; through the contact group established under the Erasmus Mundus Programme referred to above; through the policy discussions between the Commission and the Ministry of Education that have developed over the past two years, covering subjects such as the Bologna Process, the European Credit Transfer System, and quality assurance in higher education; and through networking of Higher Education Institutions under the Asia Link programme which promotes partnerships between EU and Asian (including many Chinese).

<p>(EN) The sad facts of Atenco, the offences to human rights and dignity reported by some of the protesters indicate, as promptly admitted by the Mexican Government itself, that the professionalism and training of police forces still remain an open challenge for Mexico. The context in Atenco was a hard one. Some policemen were taken hostages; there was a situation of civil unrest. However, nothing justifies the humiliating treatment reserved to the detained persons and to the women in particular.</p>
<p>The Mexican Government has informed the Commission in writing about the incidents and since then it has maintained a dialogue with the Mexican authorities about the issues in Atenco and about other cases where human rights were not adequately protected in Mexico. The Commission has have also obtained information from the civil society and from concerned non-governmental organizations whose contributions have greatly helped it in obtaining a wider understanding of the facts and have allowed it to consider them from different angles.</p>
<p>Administrative and judicial investigations are on-going. In June 2006, 4 policemen in charge of detachments of the state security agency were fired. 5 other policemen were suspended and 17 of them accused of abuse of authority received an arrest warrant and will have to face a trial. This was an initial healthy reaction by the Mexican society and State.</p>
<p>Various Mexican institutions are in charge of the investigations which are currently under way, among them State and Federal Justice. The Mexican Congress is also kept informed about the case. The head of the State Security Agency appeared at the Mexican Congress and was interviewed by Congressmen belonging to all main political parties.</p>
<p>With regards to the specific claims of violence against women in custody and the death of two civilians, the Mexican authorities started investigations aimed at clarifying the events and identifying and localizing those who are responsible.</p>
<p>The Mexican authorities also informed the Commission that 30 demonstrators remain in jail up to now.</p>
<p>In November 2006 the Mexican Human Rights Commission issued a comprehensive report on the events. The report contains important recommendations to the principal authorities involved in the incidents. The issues of professionalisation of state police forces and of inter-institutional coordination between Mexican authorities were raised in this report in order to prevent further incidents of this kind.</p>
<p>According to Commission's information, the investigations follow the due course of law. The final results of the judicial investigations will be presented by the competent authorities once the first investigations have been concluded. The Mexican authorities informed us that criminal charges may be issued against the perpetrators of the abuses. The Commission will attentively follow the forthcoming of the investigations and will keep the Parliament informed on any progress made.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0970"></a>

<p>(EN) Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1897/2000 defines the division of the population between employed, unemployed and inactive persons and gives precise implementation details in the labour force survey questionnaires. Each person of the sample is first defined as employed or not employed and then as unemployed or inactive.</p>
<p>This regulation follows the International Labour Organisation conventions especially as concerns the definition of employment on the basis of one hour worked in the reference week. This principle ensures the comparability of employment and unemployment data at international level.</p>
<p>Complementary analyses are needed to study people in border line cases. For this purpose, Eurostat publishes results<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on part time employment, full time equivalent employment rates and hours worked by persons employed full time and part time, along with results on time related under-employment and persons outside the labour market but wishing to work. The last category includes persons who wish to work but who are not looking for a job because of belief that no work is available. It also identifies all inactive persons who wish to work although they are not looking actively for work or not available to start a work within the two weeks following the survey. The results from the labour force survey, 2005 annual averages, to be published early 2007, show that 5.2% of the population aged 15-64 are not in the labour market but nevertheless willing to work, of which 0.2% because of belief that no work is available.</p>
<p>The Commission does not foresee to change the criteria for dividing the population into employed, unemployed and inactive since they rely on international standards ensuring comparability among Member States.

<p>(EN) The Commission's and the Member States' agreed policy on sexual and reproductive health and rights, including the positions abortion and sterilisation, is set out in the Programme of Action as adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo 1994.</p>
<p>Coercive abortion, forced sterilisation and infanticide or other human rights' abuses are clearly not in line with this agreed policy.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that the principle of choice is guiding the Programme for Action, the purpose of which is to provide universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family-planning methods and to reproductive health services which are not against the law of the country. The Programme aims at assisting individuals and couples to achieve their reproductive goals and give them the full opportunity to exercise the right to children.</p>
<p>The Programme does not promote abortion to be used as a method of family planning. Governments are committed to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortions as a public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through improved family-planning services. It is set out in the Programme that when abortion is not against the law, abortions should be safe. Health problems, infections etc, incurred due to abortions should be regarded as public health concerns. The Programme for action calls for safe abortions but as such does not promote nor prohibit abortions However, if abortions are legal, they must be safe.</p>
<p>The European Consensus on Development (2006/C46/01) states in section 94 that "The MDGs cannot be attained without progress in achieving the goal of universal sexual and reproductive health and rights as set out in the ICPD Cairo Agenda." The Commission development programmes are certainly not promoting any actions in contravention to these policies.</p>
<p>With regards to projects funded by the Commission under geographical or thematic budget lines, the Commission is monitoring and assessing each project to ensure that they are performed correctly. The Commission confirms that no funding is awarded to recipients if there are suspicions of actions such as indicated by the Honourable Member. Each Call for Proposal is set up to carefully reflect our policies and proposals received in response to these calls are carefully reviewed.</p>
<p>Another question is the extent to which the Commission is able to exercise control over the partner countries which receive EC support. Our tools include ongoing political dialogue with each and every recipient country on a broad agenda including good governance. Any shortcomings would then be addressed promptly by the Commission.</p>
<p>In the European Consensus for Development it is clearly stated that budget or sectoral budget support are the preferred ways to support partner countries. The abuses of HR become evident during the political dialogue that we pursue with each and every partner country (Cotonou Agreement for the ACP states and bilateral co-op agreements with other developing countries).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0978"></a>

This measure was introduced to offset the disadvantages associated with islands.</p>
<p>The regional government of the Balearics is seeking to extend the right to claim this discount to immigrants resident in the Balearics. It is basing its action on the principle of 'equal obligations - equal rights', since immigrants residing in the islands are obliged to contribute to the public purse but do not enjoy the right to benefit from discounted fares on scheduled air and sea transport services.

<p>Based on the recognition of this fact, Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals contains concrete provisions, according to which third-country nationals with long-term resident status should enjoy equality of treatment with citizens of the Member States in a wide range of economic and social matters.</p>
<p>Article 11 (1) (f) of this Directive provides that long-term residents shall enjoy equal treatment with nationals as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public and to procedures for obtaining housing.</p>
<p>The issue raised by the Honourable Member (equal reductions on air and sea fares for non-Community residents of the Balearics) appears to be covered by this provision.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that any legislative measure taken in Member States with a view to implementing the non-discrimination principle contained in Directive 2003/109/EC is welcomed by the Commission. Even though there is currently no obligation under Community law to extend the application of Article 11 (1) (f) of Directive 2003/109/EC to third country national residents who do not yet enjoy long-term resident status (e.g. because they have legally resided in a Member States for less than five years) any such extension at national level is nevertheless strongly supported by the Commission as fully coherent with its horizontal policy, set out in the September 2005 Communication on a "common agenda for integration"<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for his concern about human rights in Colombia and the extension of the mandate of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to be concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia and is engaged in a range of activities to highlight these concerns and to contribute to the defence of human rights by the High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as other human rights defenders such as non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>During 2006 the EU has pursued actively its belief that the mandate of the Office in Colombia of the High Commissioner for Human Rights should continue unchanged - notably through the Presidency Declaration of 26 June which expressed the EU's full support for the presence of the Office in Colombia and underlined the importance of the active support and use the full range of the services of the Office by the Government of Colombia, in the areas of advice, technical cooperation, monitoring and evaluation of the Human Rights situation in the country. We will continue highlighting the importance we attach to the Office with our Colombian counterparts.</p>
<p>The Commission and the EU Member States are committed to ensuring that the newly established United Nations (UN) Council for Human Rights will continue to have the powers which its predecessor, the Human Rights Commission, had which allowed it to select specific countries for special attention.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Council is, however, still at the stage of defining its internal procedures, and this has hindered its progress in tackling the substantive work on human rights which it has been created to undertake. In numerical terms, the EU’s influence on the specific issue raised may be limited given that only 8 out of the total of 47 members in the Council are EU Members States. But the Commission and the Member States will make every effort to ensure that the Council can continue the UN’s valuable work in support of human rights in specific countries including Colombia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0988"></a>

<p>(EN) As set out more fully in the Communication "Keep Europe moving" – Mid-term review of the 2001 Transport White Paper<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission is of the view that shifts to more environmentally friendly modes must be achieved where appropriate, in particular in congested corridors.</p>
<p>In practice one can observe that this phenomenon is already taking place as a result of market conditions, e.g. as regards substitution of air by rail in France as a consequence of the development of the High-Speed Train network. Between France and Belgium, the market share of aviation on the Paris – Brussels segment has been reduced to zero, following the expansion of the Thalys high speed services in the recent years.</p>
<p>More generally, the current EU legislation already allows for restrictions on environmental grounds. Under the air transport liberalization measures,</p>
<p>"When serious congestion and/or environmental problems exist the Member State responsible may… impose conditions on, limit or refuse the exercise of traffic rights, in particular when other modes of transport can provide satisfactory levels of service."<a href="#defann_60_2" name="refann_60_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>In conformity with the subsidiarity principle, it is therefore for the Member States to decide, on a case-by-case basis, what measures should be taken. As far as short haul flights are concerned, the national/ regional levels are normally better equipped to determine, depending on the alternatives available at local level, what restrictions should and can be implemented.</p>
<p>It should be very clear that the measures taken must not unduly distort competition nor create discrimination on the ground of nationality, as laid down also in Regulation 2408/92.</p>
<p>To the knowledge of the Commission, some restrictions already exist in some bilateral agreements signed by Member States, where coterminalisation (i.e. short haul flight terminating an international flight) is restricted in some cases.</p>
<p>At regional level, the Commission has also recently been made aware of recent measures taken by the Government of Wallonia in order to ban coterminalisation between Liège and Charleroi for flights to/from Morocco.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The rapid economic transformation of China is creating fresh social tensions in the country. Four years ago, the Chinese regime decided that the Pubugou dam would be built on the River Dadu. The construction of the dam and the rise in the level of the river will force some 100 000 people to relocate. Critical voices point out that the regime's promises to compensate those people lack credibility and that any newly distributed agricultural land is considerably less productive than previous land. At the same time, the popular unrest and resistance which has arisen has been met with silence. Pubugou is one of many examples of dams being built in China which make it impossible for thousands of Chinese to earn a living, people who are forced instead into insecurity and poverty.</p>

<p>(EN) The document the Honourable Member refers to is an internal discussion document of the South African Department of Land Affairs that has not been made public. The Commission is aware of its existence, but has had no access to the paper. The World Bank office in Pretoria seems to have contributed to it as consultant.</p>
<p>The document is not part of public policy on Land reform issues, at least not as yet. It must be seen against the background of the Department of Land Affairs on-going internal analysis of the causes of slow progress in the implementation of key government objectives for Land reform and of its thinking on how to chart a way forward.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the Commission to comment upon an internal discussion paper of a government department of which it has no official knowledge. However, in a more general way, the Commission closely follows the issue of land reform in South Africa and indeed in the Southern African region, given its potential political consequences. It has brought its concerns to the attention of the South African government on several occasions, including at ministerial level.</p>
<p>To the best of the Commission's knowledge, the internal discussion paper has not been formally submitted to interested stakeholders, such as farmers and land owners.</p>
<p>However, in July 2005 the SA government hosted its first ever National Land Summit, in which all stakeholders in the land reform process were invited to participate and voice their concerns. The Summit emphasised the need for faster progress in order to contain political instability. The government recognises that radical land reform is not an option in a democracy, but a more state-led interventionist approach, including greater use of expropriation, might be applied in the future. Adequate compensation in the case of expropriation is a constitutional right in South Africa. To date expropriation has only been used in very few cases, where negotiations have deadlocked.</p>
<p>Further to the involvement of farmers, it should be added that the South African government has a policy of consulting relevant stakeholders when developing new policies or preparing new legislation. In this instance the Department of Land Affairs has publicly declared that any proposal for a change in policy will be presented for discussion at the existing consultative fora with all interested stakeholders. There exists a forum on land issues that regularly meets with the South African President where commercial farmers are also represented.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1003"></a>

<p>The Sámi people are the only indigenous people of the EU. They live in a region covering parts of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. There are several Sámi languages which according to UNESCO are either endangered or seriously endangered, with native speakers of a few hundred left. During centuries the Sámi have been discriminated against by the states in their region – their religion and their language made illegal and their land rights taken away from them. In the infamous race biology of the 1900s they were described as having ‘minor heads’. This tragic history is unknown to most of the people living in Sweden and Finland today, and there is almost no information or teaching on the history and present day situation of the Sámi people. For example, in Sweden in a recent study of 30 school history books, only one had a proper picture of this minority.</p>

<p>(EN) The protection and preservation of cultural and linguistic diversity are core principals of the European Community, recognised in the EC Treaty, and more specifically in its Article 151.</p>
<p>They are also at the heart of the activities of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), including its normative work, in particular within the framework of the recently adopted Convention on cultural diversity, which the Community and the Member States are currently in the process of ratifying.</p>
<p>Exercising its responsibility as guardian of the treaties, the Commission promotes mutual respect and cultural diversity, including respect for the cultures of indigenous people, among and within its Member States. However, the main responsibility for the protection and preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity lies with the Member States. The Community complements their action through Community policy initiatives and programmes.</p>
<p>Such policies and programmes apply to the Sámi people living on the territories of Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission works jointly with the European Union High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy in furthering European values within the international community. This external dimension of European policy may apply to Sámi communities living within the territories of Norway and Russia.</p>
<p>The European Commission also promotes cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue through Community programmes:</p>
<p>Since the eighties the Commission has provided funding for bodies active in the field of regional and minority languages. The European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL) promotes and disseminates information on behalf of regional and minority languages. EBLUL has national committees in the Member States, namely in Finland and Sweden, both developing an active information activity on the Sámi people, which may be seen on their respective websites: http://www.sweblul.se/</p>
<p>; http://fiblul.eblul.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=55&amp;lang=en</p>
<p>Moreover, through its funding programmes the Commission also promotes language awareness and access to language learning resources. The new Lifelong learning programme 2007-2013 has the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity as a specific objective and offers funding possibilities for multilateral projects and/or networks for all languages present in the European Union. Of course the selection and participation criteria, namely the number of partners, have to be respected. The first call for proposals will be published by the beginning of 2007.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in its recent Communication "A new framework strategy on multilingualism"<a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission highlights the fact that the European Union is founded on "unity in diversity", including the indigenous languages present in the EU. The Commission has invited the Member States to set up national plans to give coherence and direction to actions to promote multilingualism amongst individuals and in society. National strategies should take account of the teaching of regional and minority languages.</p>
<p>Recently the Commission has welcomed the decision of the Council, which is awaiting final confirmation by the Parliament, to declare 2008 the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. This Year may provide for an opportunity for the Member States to reinforce national initiatives aimed at the promotion of cultural diversity, including among indigenous people such as the Sámi people, living on the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p>Indeed the promotion of language learning, including minority languages, is essential for intercultural dialogue.</p>
<p>The EU also has supported unanimously the prompt adoption by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly of the draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and cooperates, including financially, with UN bodies and mechanisms such as the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People.</p>
<p>Moreover, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue includes an external dimension, making it possible for non-EU countries to be associated with its policy objectives and initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) While the drugs situation varies from one country to another there can be no doubt that the problem cannot be solved by each Member State working alone. There has to be a coherent policy response across the EU. In view of tackling the drugs phenomenon, in 2004 the European Council endorsed the EU Drugs Strategy (2005-2012) which sets the framework, objectives and priorities for two consecutive four-year Action Plans to be brought forward by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Drugs Action Plan 2005-2008<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, endorsed in June 2005 contains around 80 actions in different fields, such as demand reduction, supply reduction, fight against illicit trafficking and international action. This approach obviously integrates different complementary levels:</p>
<p>Within the framework of Community powers (public health, precursor control, money laundering, development aid for third countries),</p>
<p>Within the framework of close cooperation between Member States (foreign policy, justice and home affairs),</p>
<p>Within the framework of partnership with numerous international organisations.</p>
<p>The EU Action Plan also sets out the distribution of responsibilities and schedules for their implementation. Member States are responsible for most of the actions proposed, showing the need for cooperation at all levels. Clear and concrete assessment tools and indicators have been introduced for each action proposed, to enable proper monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p>Based on this, the Commission carries out a continuous and overall evaluation of the measures contained in the Action Plan, with the support of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and Europol. In this framework, the Commission presents Annual Progress Reviews to the Council and the Parliament on the implementation of the Action Plan. The objective of these reviews is not only to report on progress but also to deal with identified gaps and possible new challenges. The first review since the adoption of the Action Plan places the results achieved within the context of a year and a half of implementation and will be presented by the Commission services by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The same exercise will be repeated in 2007 and will by then allow for a more substantial analysis. In 2008, a final evaluation/impact assessment will be presented by the Commission. This impact assessment should provide an overview not only of the specific outputs of the Action Plan but also of the state of the drugs situation in the European Union which it seeks to address. This assessment will be the basis for policy makers to prepare the next Action Plan under the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission attaches great importance to the respect of democracy, human rights and the rule of law as fundamental values underpinning the EU-Russia strategic partnership. This is the case today under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and will be so in the future under the new EU-Russia agreement to replace the PCA. The Commission hopes negotiations with Russia on the new agreement can be launched in the near future.</p>
<p>Our objectives for the new agreement in terms of democracy and human rights are as follows:</p>
<p>The new agreement should contain the standard human rights clause included in all EU agreements with third countries.</p>
<p>We also envisage the objectives and principles of the new agreement having strong references to democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law. Since Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, a reaffirmation in the new agreement of the commitments undertaken in the Council of Europe framework will constitute an important advance compared with the human rights clauses in the PCA.</p>
<p>We also envisage institutionalising in the new agreement the regular EU-Russia human rights consultations which have been held since 2005.</p>
<p>Detailed arrangements for the functioning of specific mechanisms are not a matter for the new agreement but the EU will continue to use the EU-Russia political dialogue to raise human rights issues at all levels. The EU is also exploring with Russia the possibility of expert seminars on particular human rights themes.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to refer the Honourable Member to the ongoing projects under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Tacis which are, inter alia, supporting human rights education programmes. The EC € 20 million programme for the socio-economic development of the North Caucasus region is also relevant in this respect. The Commission will continue to examine how financial cooperation with Russia can contribute to supporting the protection of human rights and the development of democracy and civil society in Russia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1008"></a>

<p>(EN) In a monetary union, well-functioning product, labour and capital markets have an important role to play in raising growth potential and cushioning the impact of economic shocks. However, if those markets have structural characteristics that make them rather rigid or inefficient, that undermines their ability to function properly and they cannot play their important role. Improving the situation necessitates structural reforms to tackle the markets' rigidity or inefficiency characterisitcs.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that the euro area's growth potential and ability to absorb the impact of economic shocks is rather low and that the functioning of its product, labour and capital markets is less than optimal. Structural reforms are therefore needed.</p>
<p>Such reforms should aim to achieve sustainable public finances, bolster labour and total factor productivity, and raise employment and participation rates whilst respecting the imperatives of sustainable development. A particular focus should be on structural reforms which (i) have significant spillovers on other euro area countries, and (ii) contribute most to essential flexibility and adjustment capacity in the context of monetary union or correct market inefficiencies. Key priorities in this regard include ensuring the sustainability of public finances, stepping up the pace of technological progress in the euro area, promoting greater competition in service and network industries, completing the integration of European financial markets and achieving greater labour-market adaptability, wage formation mechanisms better responsive to economic conditions and modernising social security systems.</p>
<p>In mid-December 2006, the Commission will produce its Annual Progress Report as part of the refocussed Lisbon Strategy. This will provide a comprehensive assessment of structural reforms inside the European Union as a whole and in the euro area.

Technical investigations are still in progress.</p>
<p>The Commission is, however, pleased to note that the Nigerian authorities have already adopted a number of measures aimed at improving air safety. These measures involve, in particular, withdrawing air operator certificates from certain local companies, including two of the three operators having recently suffered accidents (Sosoliso Airlines and ADC Airlines).

<p>(FR) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s view that Europe Houses (‘Maisons de l’Europe’) play an important and useful role in bridging the gap between Europe and its citizens. For this reason, following negotiations on the ‘Europe for citizens’ programme, the Institutions decided to add the ‘Maisons de l’Europe’ to the list of bodies designated in the legal basis for a directly allocated operating grant for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, under Action III of the programme, entitled ‘Together for Europe’.</p>
<p>As regards which bodies receive structural support, Annex 2 to the legal basis specifies that it ‘may be provided directly … for the “Maisons de l'Europe” federated at national and European level …’.</p>
<p>Structural support is therefore provided for the ‘Federation of Europe Houses’ for its own operation in its capacity as a network complying with both the spirit and the wording of the legal basis. The Commission would like to point out to the honourable Member that the federation in question was established and still exists under the name ‘EUNET’.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Europe Houses located in various European towns may also receive grants for projects for which they wish to submit an application within the framework of Action I ‘Active citizens for Europe’ and Action II ‘Active civil society for Europe’.

<p>(EN) Following a previous written question<a href="#defann_73_1" name="refann_73_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> tabled by the Honourable Member and the subsequent and thorough investigation of the facts in the case, the Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice in April 2006<a href="#defann_73_2" name="refann_73_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, concerning the M-30 Ring-road Project in Madrid, since some provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC concerning the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment<a href="#defann_73_3" name="refann_73_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> as modified by Council Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_73_4" name="refann_73_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, had not been complied with in relation to this project.</p>
<p>In summary, the project, sub-divided into a number of smaller projects had not been submitted to a global impact assessment, only some of the resulting projects had undergone some equivalent procedures; others none at all. Some of the projects are still to be implemented while others have already been completed.</p>
<p>The reply from the Spanish authorities of July 2006 has been assessed by the Commission. In summary the answer explains that the breach of the Directive in relation to this project was rather due to a non-conformity of Spanish EIA legislation<a href="#defann_73_5" name="refann_73_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> than to the deliberate will of the Madrid authorities not to comply with their obligations under EC law. The Spanish authorities explained that they are ready to launch full impact assessment procedures for the remaining projects and to take additional minimisation and compensation measures regarding projects already implemented.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member states in this question, in October the services of the Commission sent a letter to the Spanish authorities. This letter follows the reply from the Spanish authorities, of July 2006, to the Letter of Formal Notice issued by the Commission in April of the same year. The purpose of this letter was to specify what needed to be done, in the view of the services of the Commission, to repair to the extent possible some of the mistakes incurred by the Spanish authorities with regard to the above mentioned Directives.</p>

<p>At the same time, TDIs play an essential role in the protection of open trade. However, most of the proposals put forward could lead to a marked weakening of EU disciplinary measures against unfair foreign trade and would paralyse the EU's manufacturing sector. Amongst other things the proposals would shackle the aims, the operation and the achievements of trade-defence instruments.</p>

<p>(EN) The Green Paper is primarily aimed at looking at the impact of the growing globalisation on the application of Trade Defence Instruments (TDI). The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member's view that TDI plays a vital role in the defence of open markets since it addresses uncompetitive practices in a global economy.</p>
<p>The Green Paper is not meant to weaken trade defence instruments. The Green Paper is only meant to be the starting point for a thorough and open-ended reflection on TDI.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Green Paper does not put forward proposals for a change of TDI. On the contrary, it contains some 30 open questions. They cover several aspects of TDI law and practice mainly focussing on whether our TDI are still sufficiently adjusted to today's globalized world.</p>
<p>Since the last substantial reflection on TDI took place 10 years ago this is the right time to reflect and discuss and if necessary to adjust our TDI to the needs of a global market.</p>
<p>This reflection process is still at the beginning. There are no preconceived ideas. Only the comprehensive stakeholder process will show whether and to what extent changes to our TDI are ultimately needed. The Commission will involve the Parliament throughout this process and is looking forward to its input.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1046"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to the objective of achieving a real Internal Market for services and facilitating the free movement of services across Europe, the Parliament adopted its second reading on the Services Directive on 15 November 2006 based on the text of the common position adopted by the Council on 24 July 2006. The formal adoption of the Directive is expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Following the text of the Services Directive, as agreed by the two institutions, the Services Directive will apply to the regulated professions, including the legal professions (with the exception of notaries and bailiffs), as regards aspects other than those dealt with by the Professional qualifications Directive 2005/36 and the Lawyers' Directives (98/5 and 77/249). Moreover, it has been clarified in the Services Directive that in case of conflict, the specific provisions of the sectorial Directives, notably the Professional qualifications Directive 2005/36 and the Lawyers' Directives (98/5 and 77/249), will prevail over the Services Directive.</p>
<p>The Services Directive will permit notably the legal professions to facilitate the provision of their services across Europe, to modernise their legal framework and to make them more competitive whilst ensuring high quality standards. In this context, a specific provision in the Services Directive encourages the drawing up of codes of conduct and other quality enhancing measures such as quality charters by professional associations at Community level. Such provisions aim at promoting the quality of services whilst taking into account the specific nature of each profession. In this respect, the content of such codes of conduct should comply with Community law, especially competition law.</p>
<p>Concerning the specific issue of fixed tariffs for legal professions, Member States will have to conduct a “screening” of their legislation and evaluate it in the light of the conditions and obligations established in the Directive. In this respect, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) held, in the Arduino case (C-35/99), that a Member State was technically not liable under Articles 10 and 81 of the EC Treaty for delegation of regulatory powers to an association where that Member State adopts a law or regulation which approves, on the basis of a draft produced by a professional body of members of the Bar, tariff fixing minimum and maximum fees for members of the profession. The ECJ emphasised that in this case a delegation of regulatory powers by the State had not taken place because the State maintained the ultimate power to amend and enact the draft fee scale submitted by the professional body and the State maintained control over the implementation of the fixed tariffs. This reasoning was confirmed by the ECJ in its recent judgment in joined cases (C-94/04 and C-202/04) Cipolla and Macrino. Moreover, it is important that the ECJ in the same judgment in joined cases Cipolla and Macrino held that State legislation containing an absolute prohibition by agreement to derogate from minimum fees set by a scale for lawyers' fees constitutes a restriction of the freedom to provide services laid down in Article 49 EC. The ECJ held that such restriction can only be lawful if the Member State concerned is able to show that this restriction is justified by the protection of consumers or the proper administration of justice as overriding requirements relating to the public interest, on condition that the national measure in question is suitable for securing the attainment of the objectives pursued and, secondly, it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain these objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
