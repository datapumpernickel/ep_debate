We have succeeded in getting the most important issues of principle through, for example, that the user stage, that is, those who feed the animals, is also to be covered by the controls. This is a success, since approximately two-thirds of all animal feed in the European Union is produced on farms.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what the Council – and possibly also the Commission – has not taken note of is the fact that we have replaced the word ‘contaminated’ with ‘contain undesirable substances’. We are not, in fact, playing with words here. The term ‘contaminated’ must be defined in purely scientific terms with reference to substances and/or bacteria that have been added from outside, whereas ‘contain undesirable substances’ also includes those substances that are formed naturally, e.g. in the course of storage, when fat oxidises and mycotoxins are formed. There are lots of substances that are clearly inappropriate in feed, but which do not come from outside. They have arisen in natural processes which really should not have taken place. Hay should not be allowed to go mouldy, since this makes it downright dangerous. I have reintroduced all the amendments to the effect that ‘contaminated’ should be replaced by ‘contain dangerous substances’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also reintroduced Amendment 24 from the first reading, which deals with Community controls. In this case, the Council referred to a conciliation made with Mr Staes after we had started working on the report in the first reading. I have now changed the amendment to include the wording of the TSE regulation that was approved at the first plenary session in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">We should endeavour to create legislation that is clear, consistent and easy to grasp. That is why I have chosen to copy the wording of the TSE regulation on Community controls word for word. It is easier for those who have to deal with the laws and who have to comply with them if at least the standard provisions that recur in directive after directive are worded the same. I think that this is very important. Mr Staes will submit an oral amendment in this area which involves a certain expansion, and which I am able to approve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of crucial importance that we get a comprehensive control system throughout the Union. Creating good laws throughout this food safety chain that we are now working on does not involve particularly great difficulties, but it does involve hard work. The big problem comes with control and compliance. Good laws are all very well, but they are just words on paper unless we have effective control and compliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have before us the Council’s common position on amending the directives containing basic rules for the performance of official inspections of feed and concerning animal nutrition. Mrs Paulsen has at the end again made the reason for this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The crises and scandals of recent years have made a revision of the rules concerning feed an urgent necessity. Amending the directive will harmonise the conduct of official feed inspections in Europe and enshrine them in law. Member States will now be obliged to introduce appropriate emergency measures to deal with serious risks involving feed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is empowered to adopt temporary precautionary measures if animal nutrition products manufactured in the EU present a serious risk to humans, animals or the environment. Member States are obliged to inform the Commission immediately and in full of any case of contamination. This will ensure that the Commission is able to act at once.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must also prepare an annual report of all incidents and irregularities involving feed and forward it to the Commission. The Council has accepted the European Parliament’s core demands for comprehensive feed inspections, namely the use of a generic term covering all products intended for use in the food and feed chain down to the final consumer. These were included in the common position. This took account of the intensive debate in the European Parliament. At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, sincerely for her handling of this difficult task.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council was unable to comply with Parliament’s call for the directive also to be extended to changes that occur as a result of faults and flaws in the manufacturing process. Mrs Paulsen has just referred to this. For that reason, the rapporteur has retabled the corresponding amendments from the first reading in the slightly modified form required, as she has described. The report was accepted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The adjustments made to the tabled amendments were necessary in order to bring them closer to the corresponding articles of Directive 1999/29/EC on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition. They were also brought into line with the corresponding article of the TSE Regulation on Community inspections. Acceptance of the amendments would create a uniform, clear and transparent inspection system tailored to the new requirements of the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are gathered here with a reasonable unanimity in the committee, with a very modest number of amendments but with an absolute certainty that we want to press our point. If codecision is to have any meaning, that is a position we will maintain to the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I am putting the position of my group in the absence of Mrs Roth-Behrendt who, as some will know, is in hospital in Berlin. I saw her last week in Berlin and I am sure she is making a rapid recovery and would wish all to know that her heart remains in our proceedings in these matters of food hygiene and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">There are only six amendments which the House has to consider tonight: five from the committee as a whole and the sixth tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. My group supports all of them for one simple reason: we surely should have learned by now the lesson that precision and targeting of possible dangers in animal feed is of the essence of the precautions that we need to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last two or three years we have seen enough of the dreadful practices in parts of the animal-feed industry, sometimes practices that were already illegal according to the rules of those days. They need to be tightened up quickly. Precision is at the heart of what Mrs Paulsen has had to say to us today. Precision in language most of all: the word "contamination" is not satisfactory when it is used in the phraseology of the food authority proposals, which we will be discussing shortly. It is not sufficient where we need to be able to have a further process of scrutiny and inspection of damaging materials that may be inserted very early on into the manufacture of animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that one important principle is enshrined in this report as it goes through to the next stage: animal feed should be taken as seriously for all of us in our own interests as human food. The two are more or less indistinguishable, both in their effects on human kind and on the animals with whom we share this planet.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an election going on in Britain and yesterday I was doing my stuff on the doorstep in a country village. People were asking whether veterinary inspections were secure and safe and could possible be self-policed. I have known and represented that place for 30 years. Ten years ago you would never have heard these considerations. The fact that they are now paramount argues the case for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of my speech is mainly to state that we support the amendments the rapporteur has tabled. They are most justified with regard to the users of animal feed, the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The term “official inspections” used in the title of the report is a very telling one, as there has been no comprehensive system of official inspections, the consequences of which have been dire. Furthermore, the way the inspections are defined and described, including the notion of all “products for animal nutrition”, is, in my opinion, excellent. The amendments also emphasise the need to take account of faults and flaws in the production process. This is also only right. One or two amendments likewise very aptly stress the importance of inspections. For example, the notions of ‘country of origin’ and ‘Member State of destination’ and co-operation between them, with all their attendant obligations, are described. Co-operation and inspections must be conducted transparently, including checks made in Member States as mentioned in Amendment No 5. This amendment also states that experts should be provided with “all the assistance necessary for carrying out their duties.” Such definitions and specifications make excellent terms of reference for this directive, its implementation, and its monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make one point, Mr President. We will recall from recent history such matters as dioxins and the use of swill in animal feed. We are moving towards an enlarged EU. The future Member States are predominantly agricultural countries. It is therefore excellent that the vital matters that are in our hands – such as that of official inspections – are to be straightened out first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animal feed or, more appropriately, the ingredients used in its manufacture are understandably central to the regulations governing food safety and consumer protection. This Parliament and the Commission have certainly burnt the midnight oil putting in place controls which must eliminate for all time the reoccurrence of BSE or the dioxin scare, which has cost farmers and the food sector dearly and caused so much worry to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned an expensive lesson but one that marked an important turning-point in EU food production and one from which we can benefit in the long term. There is no place for dissidents in this new regime and those found in breach must be strongly disciplined.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is not a time for apportioning blame for what has happened, I believe farmers were by and large innocent victims of sections of an unscrupulous animal-feed sector, some of which resorted to the use of sewage sludge as an ingredient in animal feed, while others continued to use illegal meat and bone meal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Paulsen and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the broad support given to this Commission proposal concerning controls on animal nutrition. I am also grateful to this Chamber, because adoption of this proposal will mean the fulfilment of one of my first commitments to improve food quality and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the proposal was articulated on three main issues. The first is the obligation for Member States to have contingency plans in place to deal with feed emergencies. Secondly, it will provide a legal basis for the adoption of safeguard measures for products originating within the Community. Thirdly, it will provide a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition, with particular reference to a rapid alert system.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position adopted by the Council last February, which was also endorsed by the Commission, improved the Commission proposal. The three main issues of the proposal were properly addressed in the common position, which also includes many of the suggestions made by Parliament in first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied that this agrees with the most fundamental parts of the common position. Concerning the amendments tabled for this Parliament, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4, which will improve the clarity of the text. The Commission can also accept Amendment No 5, because it takes into consideration the evolution of other important legislation in this sector, such as the TSE regulation approved by the European Parliament at the last Parliament part-session. In principle, the Commission accepts the legitimate expectation of informing the European Parliament on the inspection results. However, the way Amendment No 6 is drafted cannot be accepted because it does not foresee informing the other Member States for the sake of consistency. I understand that it was intended to put forward an oral amendment to include this reference; and if that, is done, I am in a position to accept that amendment too. If that oral amendment is tabled, it will take the place of Amendment No 5. So be it, the Commission can accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept Amendments No 1, 2, 3 and 4. Amendment No 5 is accepted while Amendment No 6 is not accepted unless in the form that I suggest, which I understand Parliament may put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The five amendments to the Paulsen report are correct in terms of the principles and I hope that the Council will also agree that they deserve to be incorporated in the final directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Goodwill has been shown for this dossier by all the institutions and I hope that the final directive can be approved quickly. I am grateful for the constructive approach taken to this dossier by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
