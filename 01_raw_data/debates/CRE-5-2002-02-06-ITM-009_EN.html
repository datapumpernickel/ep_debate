<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pohjamo (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank everyone for their active involvement in preparing this report. The subject gave rise to some lively debate in committee and there were some good amendments to the report. The representatives of the Commission also brought their input to the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the committee was in full agreement with the main aims of my report. In my opinion, the Union’s economic, social and territorial cohesion is an aim that is as essential as the single market or monetary union. The forthcoming enlargement is a major challenge, and it will also bring pressure for reform in the administration of regional policy and the Structural Funds. The purpose of this report is to analyse the problems of practical implementation and put forward proposals on how the operation of the Structural Funds might be improved within the framework of the existing rules and what facts should be taken into account in preparing the next reform. The report brings a practical viewpoint to the debate on regional policy kindled by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to obtain background information for my report, I sent a bulky questionnaire to a number of regions in each Member State. Replies have come in from almost every Member State, and, as a result, I learnt of the practical experience gained, directly from the regions and people who had implemented programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I wish to focus on the report’s most important conclusions. The first is the increase in effectiveness and results. In the practical implementation of the Structural Funds one should be aiming at effective and result-oriented use of appropriations, execution of projects according to timetable, and optimum project quality. In the regions, the administration of the Structural Funds is often felt to have become more difficult, and bureaucracy seems to have increased. The regions feel the financing provisions are complicated, partly unclear and open to interpretation, although the aim has certainly been otherwise. Funding should be channelled as directly as possible to the regions, which should be allowed to differentiate themselves from one another in order to be able to make effective use of the aid from the Structural Funds. With cooperation from the regions, Member States and the Union, administration should be improved so that the right actions target the right regions at the right time in terms of getting results. Management and its follow-up must be flexible and proportionate to the size of the programmes or projects. The n+2 rule for financing must be kept in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The key aim of the report is the simplification and clarification of practices and administration, and increased results. The Court of Auditors has also criticised the complicated practices associated with the Structural Funds and called for simplification and better results, and this has also been the Commission’s aim, although there is still much to be done regarding this both by the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second conclusion of the report was that programmes should not take so long to get started. The new programming period has got off the ground very slowly, with programmes taking as much as two years to be approved. The Member States have not been able to forward their documents on time, and the Commission was slow to process documents. Simplification and clarification will also help to avoid delays. As a possible remedy, the report suggests separating the periods covered by Objective Programmes and Community initiatives so that their preparation is not scheduled for the same time. In this way there would be more preparation time for both the Commission and the regions and the sort of delays that are occurring at present would not arise as we move into the next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important conclusion of the report is that the principle of additionality should be applied. The Union’s regional policy has weakened the situation where EU funding replaces national funding: the regions have even seen more national money withdrawn from them that they have received from the Union. The Commission should review and clarify the rules for compliance with additionality so that this principle would also apply at programme and regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth conclusion of the report is more effective evaluation and monitoring of the Structural Funds. Monitoring should be more concerned with results: what has been achieved with funding and how. Parliament should have open and transparent channels for obtaining information and arranging follow-up. The Commission should produce the necessary background information and reports in a clear form so that the committee and Parliament can use them effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was drafting the recommendations for voting, I supported the amendments that reinforced the conclusions of the report. My colleagues also tabled amendments regarding the content, which in themselves were worthy of support, but fell outside the scope of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes perfect sense for the European Parliament to study, discuss and propose ways of improving the practical implementation and the management of the Structural Funds with a view to achieving greater efficiency. Despite the fact that the reform of the Structural Funds culminated in the 1999 Berlin Summit, which made substantial improvements to the way in which it is run, the experience of the last two-and-a-half years tells us that there is room for further improvements. The importance of the objectives of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of which the Structural Funds are a fundamental instrument, forces us to make continual efforts to improve. And we are all obliged to make this effort: the European institutions, specifically the Commission, but also the Member States and the beneficiary regions. What we really need is a continuation of the work to simplify and to minimise the bureaucracy of the functioning of the Structural Funds, which makes it necessary to improve management methods in areas such as the funding, monitoring, following-up and implementation of the programmes we support. By the same token, the Member States and the regions must be more selective in their choices of projects to support and ensure that appropriations are put to the best use and, for this reason, the ‘performance reserve’-type mechanisms must be improved in order to encourage and reward the regions that have made the best use of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, national economic policies must never neglect the objectives of economic and social cohesion at domestic level, and I would want them to be coherent and not contradict these objectives. The same applies to the other Community policies, specifically the common agricultural policy, competition policy and State aid, which could be of enormous value, because of the importance of the legal and financial instruments that underpin them and if they were better directed towards other plans for cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus, lastly, on the need for greater decentralisation, or a more effective implementation of the principle of subsidiarity in the context of the European Union’s policy for economic and social cohesion. Obviously, there is still scope in this field to give the Member States and the regions more responsibility. The principles of decentralisation and subsidiarity must be taken as far as possible. We must, however, be careful. Let us not confuse, where the Structural Funds are concerned, the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity with a hypothetical and absurd renationalisation of the European Union’s economic and social cohesion policy. The principle of subsidiarity must never be used as an instrument with which to attempt to drain the financial resources of the European Union’s economic and social cohesion policy. What this principle requires instead is an effective policy, at European level, of economic and social cohesion, and it also calls for an improvement in the resources allocated to this genuine pillar of European integration, in light of the challenge posed by enlargement and by the drastic increase in the consequent regional asymmetries. Let us not forget that countries such as the United States of America allocate more resources to redistribution policies than the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to sum up, I say ‘yes’ to greater decentralisation of the management<span class="italic"> </span>of the Structural Funds; but ‘yes’ also to maintaining and improving the essential functions of the European Union’s economic and social cohesion policy, which are the redistribution of resources and the promotion of development in its least-favoured regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an own-initiative report by Parliament in which we are attempting to introduce new ideas that will improve the management of the Structural Funds at a crucial time for both the European Union as a whole and for the future of this Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has arisen from the obvious need to improve the management of regional policy, as a whole, and that of the Structural Funds, which needs to be managed in a more flexible way. It also responds to the widespread sense of unease in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The room for manoeuvre and involvement of this Parliament when the Commission presents its reports is practically zero. Therefore, we believe that it is time to give both the Funds, on the one hand, and Parliament on the other, a greater political role to play. It is time to ensure that the delays which currently afflict the management of these important Funds are not ignored; it is time to correct them and to add new features.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to differentiate between the budgetary efficiency of the Funds and their real effectiveness. Flexibility is, without a doubt, a factor that will increase the real impact of the Structural Funds on society and on the greater cohesion that we are all looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to introduce new measures for the assessment of these Funds and more socioeconomic parameters, good practices, greater visibility and, of course, better monitoring of the principle of additionality. We believe that initiatives such as this, which will hopefully be approved in tomorrow’s vote, will bring new ideas that will improve the management of the Structural Funds and regional policy as a whole. This will ensure that we arrive at the new Agenda 2006 with a major element of added value for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are the result, no more, no less, of the observation of failures in previous programmes. How can we therefore fail to agree with a number of proposals, which are declarations of intent that seek to make the programming system more efficient?</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to highlight some priorities which appear important, particularly on the ground, when I visit my citizens. I hear the first comment time and time again, which concerns the limitation of small projects. General simplification is, of course, a laudable objective, but it must not automatically lead to large projects being favoured; only the good projects and those which are useful in terms of development and that are economically viable should be favoured.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment relates to the political will to increase the involvement of Member States and their local and regional authorities in monitoring, but also, prior to this, in drawing up programmes, because we must bear in mind and remember that the most appropriate level from which to properly judge a project is the level that is closest to the person responsible for its initiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, every aspect of this subject, whether it be the definition of programmes in the regions, the way they are monitored or developed, or, above all, the way various assessments are completed, reminds me – and I hope that you will forgive me for using this expression – of a labyrinth. We must ensure that excessive collaboration and a surfeit of technocratic barriers do not put the projects at risk and do not result, as in France, in the funds being only partially used.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot conclude without giving my thoughts on paragraph 12 of the report. It is curious, to say the least, to see the Commission being asked to interfere in the legal and administrative affairs of the Member States. In answer to whether to be more or less regionalised, this is their problem.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it is all the more difficult to allow Europe, on the pretext of regionalisation, to once again assume a right that belongs to it because it results in the Member States being stripped of their substance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been carefully reading these reports for years, and the catalogue of defects is always basically the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, an attempt was made to simplify regional policy under Agenda 2000, yet I still have criticisms of four key areas: first, a lack of efficiency; secondly, high administrative expenditure; thirdly, high liability to fraud and fourthly, a lack of evaluation. I am committed to the fundamental European concept of solidarity. It is also in the interests of the prosperous States to bring the poorer ones up to the Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that belief, I call for a far-reaching reform of the EU's regional policy, without critical examination of which the future of the enlarged EU, especially as regards its post-2006 financial arrangements, will be uncertain. Do not misunderstand me: enlargement will cost a fair bit and people have to be told that. How sensible is it, though, in reality, for the Commission, for example, on the one hand, to propose cuts in the CAP to the candidates for enlargement and, on the other hand, to make available more extensive structural aid by way of compensation? These Structural Funds can only be used to their fullest extent if the applicant countries take on board the fact that their budgets are going to incur new debts. Has the Commission really thought this through? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
