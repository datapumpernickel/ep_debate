<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Malmström (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, it has now been 50 years since we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. After the horrors of the Second World War, many surely felt a strong sense of hope for a better world and a more humane future. Unfortunately, these hopes have, in many respects, been dashed. A large proportion of the world's population is still living under oppression, with many deprived of their basic rights. We read daily of gross violations of human rights on grounds of gender, religion, ethnic origin, political views, sexual orientation etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community was formed in order to prevent the atrocities of the Second World War from occurring again. The EC became more than just an economic union; it became an important common value-system based precisely on the respect for human rights. Both internal work and foreign policy rest on this principle. The European Parliament has always considered the promotion of these rights to be one of its most important tasks. This work has become even more important as time has gone by. No one can fail to appreciate the commitment found, for example, in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects, the EU has a good policy on human rights but, unfortunately, it is much too ‘straggly’ and incoherent. The EU is therefore in desperate need of a coordinated, strategic and consistent policy in this area. The Council's report that came out in October last year was a good first step. This was a welcome report which Parliament had waited many years for, and which we hope to see more of. It is important, but it contains several deficiencies and needs to be supplemented. In my opinion some of these deficiencies are linked to structural barriers and precisely this lack of a common strategy within the EU in the area of human rights. We need increased coordination, not just between the institutions of the EU, but also between the EU and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must be integrated into the EU's activities naturally: in aid, in trade, in economic, cultural and political cooperation. We need a consistent policy that is credible and predictable. The EU must speak with one voice and give consistent signals to the countries that violate human rights. There must be no doubt about what the EU stands for. Certain basic rights are universal. Violations of these can therefore never be excused on grounds of religion, culture or tradition. Serious violations, which are specified in international conventions cannot – must not – be treated as internal matters. Therefore, I want to encourage the Council to draw up a strategy for improving the work and making it better defined and hopefully more successful. A few suggestions that may be included in such a strategy are, for example, that the Council could develop its own human rights indicators that could be used in connection with trade agreements. These clauses can be used constructively, but they need to be more closely defined with respect to application, implementation and sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">We could also form an advisory group containing representatives from the different EU institutions. They could meet on a regular basis to discuss the promotion of human rights in the short and long term. There ought to be experts in the EU's delegations in third countries. We must work more systematically to collect and evaluate data, information and background material. We need an early warning system for violations of human rights. We also need a web site where we can present the work being done with regard to human rights, showing, for example, who is doing what and what results have been achieved. The web site could also contain links to different organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about women's rights, an issue that I have chosen as a special theme in the report. The Commission declared 1999 to be the year for combating violence against women. It was a praiseworthy initiative, but the campaign was discreet to say the least. We need long-term work, not occasional campaigns. Women's rights are being systematically violated throughout the world. Reports abound on violence in the home, rapes, ritual violence and maltreatment in prisons. During the 1990s, rape was used systematically as an act of war in many armed conflicts. This can now be a matter for examination in the International Criminal Court. Rape is at present the world's most common crime of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports from the UN claim that, every year, more women die from the effects of violence in the home than as a result of traffic accidents, malaria, cancer or war put together. The trade in women and children is increasing at an alarming rate. In certain countries, the governments are employing a pure apartheid policy against women. Thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women is a global issue which needs to be high on the international agenda and which must assume a central place in EU policy making, particularly in relations with offending countries. The issue must be dealt with in diplomatic relations and raised with the candidate countries in the course of the negotiations relating to the enlargement of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the EU must ratify the report of the proceedings of the International Criminal Court as soon as possible so that it can start work. The EU can play an important part when it comes to encouraging countries to ratify different international conventions for the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by saying that the reports that will be discussed after mine show that there are also violations of human rights within the EU. Obviously we need to deal with this. If we want to be credible internally, we also need to have a sound policy externally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are universal, that is to say indivisible and independent of countries and parties. They are concerned not with opinions but with actions. They provide protection against injustice and discrimination. They should be clear and comprehensible and not consist of idle talk. We are to build upon firm ground when we talk of human rights, and we should therefore especially build upon those conventions to which the countries concerned have acceded and upon the legal practice which the Council of Europe’s Court of Human Rights has developed in such a distinguished way since the Second World War. The EU should not be changing or reinventing things. Instead, the EU should have the status of a legal person, it should accede to the human rights conventions and, in that way, guarantee that human rights are respected, including in countries where the EU has jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="contents">The aforesaid legal practice is not static. Fortunately, it is developing the whole time. Think of the latest judgement on homosexual equality, which has caused Great Britain to change its legislation, and the same will hopefully happen soon in Austria. I also hope that there will soon be a judgement ensuring that citizens are not only entitled to form trade unions but also to be free to join them. The conventions too are constantly being supplemented. We have obtained conventions on bio-ethics and on the protection of personal data and private life, but I should especially like today to draw your attention to two new conventions from 1995 and 1998 concerning national minorities. I think that Bosnia and Kosovo have taught us all that national minorities constitute the most potentially explosive factor in the Europe of the future. We must demand of the candidate States, including Turkey, that, if they want to be a part of the Community, they have to guarantee that national minorities are able to lead their daily lives in peace, using the language they have always spoken in the area concerned. The new Member States should not only comply with these requirements at the present time. They should also guarantee that they will do so in the future and should therefore sign and ratify the conventions, as they would also wish to do, if they have not already done so. But so too must the present Member States. Let us therefore urgently entreat those countries which have not ratified these conventions on national minorities to see to it that this is done straight away. After five years, two Member States have still not signed the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. They are Belgium and France which otherwise, of course, show such a keen interest in the situations in other countries. Now, I think, they should put matters in order in their own countries and get these conventions signed. </p>
<p class="contents">The demands we impose upon others we must also impose upon ourselves. We must say to all fifteen governments: go home and get the conventions signed and ratified. Remember, too, the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and remember the Convention for the International War Crimes Tribunal, which only Italy has ratified. We must all ratify this, for the only means of combating the vicious circle of revenge and people’s taking the law into their own hands is to have war criminals brought to justice and sentenced. I also want to mention the Convention against Torture, which Ireland has still not ratified. Likewise, Belgium, Ireland and Great Britain have yet to recognise the United Nations Committee Against Torture as being competent to deal with individual complaints. I could talk at length, partly about the conditions to which asylum seekers are subject in our Member States. If only half of what is stated in the reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is correct, then the situation regarding the treatment of asylum seekers is indefensible. I could also mention children’s rights, which are a huge problem, including in a number of candidate States. I could mention the continued discrimination against handicapped people, and I should also like to emphasise, further to Cecilia Malmström’s speech, that, when it comes to women’s equality, we constantly fall short, in the Union’s Member States too. Finally, I want to say that we should perhaps have certain new tools for monitoring human rights, and I would point out that, when it comes to national minorities, it would perhaps be an idea if, in conjunction with the Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna, we were also to have the treatment of national minority languages monitored. I would also mention my proposal that we should have a supervisory body responsible for monitoring effectively the protection of personal data and the right to private life. Technology is developing and so too, therefore, must our instruments for the protection of human rights. </p>

Its starting point is the European Year Against Racism 1997 but the context has moved on significantly. I very much welcome the positioning of the fight against race discrimination firmly in a human rights context by placing it in this joint debate because that is very much the approach taken in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first theme highlighted is that in the last year we have established two facts in law and in practice. The first is the legal competence of the European Union to fight racism. The second is the fact that race discrimination is a breach of a fundamental right and European Union law. This is reflected in the confirmation through the accession process, not least the Commission communication on which Mr Belder has reported, and I congratulate him, that respect for racial equality and minority rights falls within the Copenhagen criteria. Could I just say as an aside that the ELDR amendments to Mr Belder’s report amplify rather than conflict with his report and were tabled because, unfortunately, the Citizens Rights Committee opinion was not voted on in the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vitality, economic prosperity and international influence. European identity is not a homogenous white culture and it can, and must, expand to encompass the experience and culture of minority communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly my report notes that racial prejudice and discrimination poisons our whole society, including for white people. Surveys show that racism has increased and there is an increase in racist violence and support for extremist parties. On the other hand there is also progress, however bumpy, and some regions and cities in Europe are becoming at ease with a multi-racial and multi-cultural way of life. I would cite London, which I represent, as the multi-racial capital of Europe. Certainly I believe we need to talk a lot about racism and diversity and identity, not sideline the issues or talk in code. Some may find the language in my report blunt and it is certainly intended to be clear and unambiguous. This report stresses a rights-based approach and particularly welcomes the prospect of EU anti-discrimination legislation based on Article 13 and other legal measures such as enhanced rights for third country nationals. But that cannot be the end of the story and there are measures proposed in the field of education, media and politics, and justice in policing, immigration and asylum policy, which would be aimed to back up the implementation of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I just address three aspects which I understand caused some difficulty for some Members of the EPP-ED Group. The first is the mention of Austria and the entry of Haider’s party into government and recalling the Parliament’s decision in February. I have to say that it would be perverse to discuss the European Union’s strengthened response to racism without referring to recent developments which have been a landmark in establishing that the European Union is a community of values based on respect for human rights. The second area where there are apparently EPP-ED hesitations is regarding enhanced rights for legally resident third country nationals of which there are around 20 million in the Union. My understanding is that there is nothing in this report that the EPP has not been able to accept in the past. The third area which I understand creates some problems for the EPP-ED Group is the belief that this report breaches subsidiarity by mentioning matters like education and policing. But as I said in opening, the combination of Articles 6 and 7, Article 13 and Article 29 of the Treaties have established that the combating of race discrimination is an objective and a competence of the European Union including the area of policing.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few of the EPP-ED amendments which I can accept although it is perhaps a pity that they did not make more input at committee stage. Could I appeal to Members of that group to deal with their points of disagreement by making explanations of vote. I believe this report will get majority support here in plenary. It was adopted by a large majority in committee and some of the supporters of the Conservatives and Christian Democrats may not appreciate their failure to be part of that majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I just finally say that I can accept some of the amendments from the Green Group and the GUE, particularly the one which I welcome to replace the term “holocaust” by “Shoah”. There is some confusion from the GUE Group about the purpose of ethnic monitoring which is simply to collect statistics on the progress of ethnic minorities so as to be a basis for future policy. It is not in order to identify discrimination and I hope they will understand if I reject their amendments on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope very much that the report will get a large majority when it is voted on later.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please allow me to make a direct reference. These evil and harmful human phenomena are also completely at odds with the Bible. Indeed, the word of God repeatedly and emphatically speaks of hospitality and mercifulness to strangers, as well as true charity as a consequence of our love for God, the Creator of all mankind. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the day-to-day reality is disappointing. Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are realities in Eastern and Western Europe alike. However, this situation should not lead to debilitating mutual recriminations or imputations. Quite the opposite, in fact: a common social threat requires a common, political effort. </p>
<p class="contents">Hence the expediency of the Commission’s communication in May last year and the present report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. The European Parliament sets great store by countering racism, xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries, as is evident from the report and opinions. This kind of attention also requires us to look into our own hearts. Mrs Ludford’s report bears witness to this. Indeed, the European Union’s moral standards for newcomers apply just as much to the Member States themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to manifestations of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, the Member States are by no means holier than thou. In fact, extreme-right movements from Western Europe are looking to establish contact with like-minded people in Central and Eastern Europe and are fanning the fire of doom there, the fire which was once kindled by the secret services of the former communist regimes no less. The enormity of the issues affecting the Roma people in Central and Eastern Europe stands out for two reasons. Quantitatively, because it affects several million people and qualitatively, because the very existence of this extremely diversified people is at stake. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the Roma issue with all its intricacies in a nutshell. For example, how can the Roma break through the social barrier and widespread discrimination whilst maintaining their identity? How can they be galvanised into social involvement and into achieving the much-needed change in mentality? </p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, such profound questions are heard – officially and unofficially – within the candidate Member States. They have led to well thought-through and promising initiatives and projects at national level, but these absorb a huge amount of funding. In a nutshell, the EU’s future Member States are making a direct appeal for solidarity to the current EU Members. Or does the Western expert’s razor-sharp criticism levelled at the European Union for its dismissive attitude towards Roma asylum-seekers cut ice after all? I quote: “On the one hand, the Central and Eastern European countries are pilloried on account of their policy of structural discrimination etc. and on the other hand, most EU countries are banishing the Roma collectively on account of them being economic migrants”. </p>
<p class="contents">The latter injustice should certainly not be missed out from the trio of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate Member States. In the wake of the holocaust, the systematic mass murder of millions of European Jews, antisemitism has still not disappeared from Central and Eastern Europe. Extreme left and extreme right did not – and still do not – shrink from using this execrable and pernicious political instrument of battle. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, antisemitism does not appear to bear any relevance to the numerical presence of Jews. For example, demagogues will take pleasure in pointing out the Jewish background – founded or not, as the case may be – of their hated political rivals. And this is also borne out by the umpteen reprints of the notorious antisemitic protocols of the Wisemen of Sion, this fictitious account by the tsarist secret service dating back to 1897, of the Jewish grasp for world domination across the entire region. Still less credible are the conspiracy ideas cooked up by the ultra-nationalist grouping where the so-called traditional enemies, i.e. the national minorities in various candidate countries, are systematically associated with Jews. In this light, Jews and Hungarians are seen as traitors of the mother country in Romania. The same goes for Jews and Germans, and for Jews and Czechs in Czechoslovakia, Jews and Germans in Poland and Jews and Turks in Bulgaria. </p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 32 of the draft resolution should be read against this dark background. The European Parliament has called for constant political and social vigilance towards, and for stricter constitutional prosecution of, the unabating antisemitic comments expressed within the various candidate countries, bearing in mind that latent antisemitic feelings and thoughts are fairly widespread. </p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the fruitful and probing discussions held within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and also the opinions presented by the rapporteurs of the other committees, this report now lies before you in this form. The amendments have been carefully weighed up within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and quite a few have been honoured. Mainly to avoid duplication, I will only partly support the newly tabled amendments. All in all, the present report requires, in my opinion, regular follow-ups or continuous re-assessment. It would mean a great deal to me if this were to be accomplished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of Europe which we are disturbed about. When the debate about Austria – which has many elements, many complexities – was unfolding we realised that on the edges of Austria there were significant candidate countries which, while they were making progress in economic, progress in social aspects, represented a real problem with regard to their treatment of minorities. In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the Roma. What we must realise is that, as we enlarge Europe, we have a significant responsibility for ensuring that any country that wishes to join the European Union must also reform the way that it treats minorities and the way that it treats the whole question of race discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make two or three other very simple points. What the Roma situation shows, what Mr Belder's report shows, is that an extreme version of discrimination clearly exists throughout the European Union, otherwise we would not be discussing this issue. There are many questions we must discuss: How strongly will we push the question of Article 13? Do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the European Union? The answer is yes. We must have it quickly and we must have comprehensive legislation. If we look around the European institutions and Parliament, we realise there are very few faces from ethnic minorities. That situation is improving, but ultimately we have institutions which are bereft of representation. It is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle. Racism is a complex issue. We have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the relevant debate within committee, it appears that Parliament supports the human rights principles unanimously, which I can only applaud. I also back the rapporteur’s decision to deal extensively with the women’s rights issue. With the sharia on the up in various parts of the world, this issue is more topical than ever. The situation remains extremely alarming in Afghanistan, where, since the Taliban have taken over power, women are no longer allowed to go out to work, are beaten in public for wearing indecent clothing and have hardly any access to medical care. According to reports which reached me over the past couple of days, the number of suicides among female intellectuals has risen dramatically over the past couple of weeks. </p>
<p class="contents">The example of Afghanistan illustrates that discrimination against women is not a cultural but a political phenomenon. Moreover, Afghanistan is not the only country where the rights of women are violated on a massive scale. Millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off. In many African countries, women are not allowed to own any possessions or open a bank account without the permission of a man. Other practices, such as polygamy or the inheriting of widows, have become untenable in an AIDS era. It is hardly surprising that in Africa, more women than men are infected with the AIDS virus. We must condemn all practices which lead to the mutilation or death of women. Within the European Union, female circumcision must be made a punishable offence. This is not a matter of tradition or culture, it is one of the basic human rights. But the atrocities in the rest of the world should not blind us to the atrocities in our own countries. Domestic violence is still a huge problem within the European Union. We must take a firm stance against this, which also involves prosecution. Just as serious is the problem of white slavery: 500 000 women and girls per annum are imported to Western Europe alone. A business which is estimated by the UNDP to be worth USD 7 billion. A powerful and concerted effort is needed from all Member States to fight this outrageous form of trafficking in human beings. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this report sends a powerful message to the Council and Commission. I urge both institutions to turn it into something tangible, something concrete, and to do something constructive with it. In any case, we will judge them on their actions, not their words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to reduce human rights to general principles, and very often we use the issue as a convenient way to appease our consciences. However, this resolution takes into account the changing nature of human rights, and the need to continually adapt our legal instruments and our capacity for dealing with fresh risks and emergencies and meeting fresh challenges. </p>
<p class="contents">Another strong point of this resolution is the way it considers, reconsiders and reaffirms that human rights are an essential component of the identity of the European Union, a European Union which is a community of values and in which human rights are the basis of our every endeavour and intent. Either the European Union will be an area where rights are upheld or it will not exist at all. If we cannot require all the third countries with which the European Union has economic and political relations to respect human rights, then the 15-Member State Europe will be condemned to remaining merely an economic convention. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to touch briefly on two points, which are based on the fact that, frequently, the West is not only a participant but also a protagonist in violations of human rights. For this reason, we consider that it was right to call upon the countries of the European Union to cancel the Third World debt in this resolution. We feel that the right to development should be a global priority and that it is an essential condition if human rights policies in these countries are to be genuinely implementable.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If we want to avoid being insensitive, we should also consider the offences against less traditional rights perpetrated by the processes of globalisation. For example, observance of economic and social rights would avoid our future society being made up of the privileged few who assuage their consciences by carrying on noble, general battles against the death penalty, for example, and a large number of people who are living under a death sentence imposed by the processes of exclusion and economic marginalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that there should be greater focus on the right to privacy – and this is the subject of an amendment which we are going to table in tomorrow’s plenary sitting. We are men and women, citizens, not mere numbers. We want to safeguard our right to protect our ideas, feelings and emotions against the invasion of the technology of our Big Brothers, as has been shown to be necessary by the recent ECHELON affair which is shortly to be tackled by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that over a hundred Members’ signatures have been collected in support of the nomination of the Mothers of <span class="italic">Plaza de Mayo</span> for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is important not only as a symbolic action but also because it reaffirms the right to remember as an inalienable right: it is our right, and also our duty, not to forget. For the sake of its political civilisation and values, we call upon Parliament to help the Union ensure that every unpunished violation and every offence committed against human rights, from Plaza de Mayo to Tiananmen Square, is recalled at every possible opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They provide the Commission, the Council, and also Parliament, with many ideas to really improve and guarantee human rights. One example of this is Mrs Malmström's suggestion of a special representative to protect those fighting for human rights. It is also the duty of Parliament to examine the question of human rights in the candidate countries in a systematic way. We have the knowledge, but we need to coordinate it and ensure that it is put to use so that we can influence the enlargement of the Union in such a way that human rights are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that Mr Haarder took up the rights of minority groups. It will be an historic moment if we adopt Mr Haarder's report and call attention to the crimes and the lack of respect for the rights of minority groups that are found within the EU. It is time to put a stop to the contradictory messages we have been giving out in this regard and which have meant that we have required more of the candidate countries than we have of ourselves. In actual fact, I have no hesitation in saying that it will be an historic moment when we adopt Mr Haarder's report because it would not previously have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention another matter that is close to my heart, namely aid for the Commission's work for children's rights as expressed in Cecilia Malmström's report. The Commission needs this aid. We ought also to give aid when it comes to allocating budget funds to work for children's rights. I also believe that, in this area, we need to guard against children’s becoming a commodity. There is also a lack of respect for the rules of the Hague Convention and, as far as this is concerned, we also have very, very serious problems in the candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without civil society we are living in a vacuum. We cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside, from grassroots level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains a number of excellent and well-considered proposals. I would like to draw your attention here to just three, regarding which my Group has been active. They are: the need to act when independent journalists are attacked, the need to protect conscientious objectors and deserters, and the need to develop smart sanctions, which do not make conditions wretched for vast sections of the population, but which are targeted at the political tyrants that have amassed riches. This is a precision weapon, which must be utilised more.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking more generally, as Mrs Malmström herself also said, we have to develop a strategic approach to all the problems we are speaking about today. It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels. We cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment.

Racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the European Union and beyond. Our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to its clear-sightedness, Mrs Ludford’s report actively contributes to this approach. Denouncing racism, including racist talk, does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe. Racism is not an opinion. It is a crime against human dignity. It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals. This has recently been seen in El Ejido in Spain and it also happened with the attacks on the homes of Turkish workers in Rostock and with the death of young Ibrahim Ali who was killed in Marseilles in 1995 by billposters of the French National Front. On each occasion, people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation. This can be seen in the discrimination applied in access to housing, leisure facilities and employment. You will all be aware of the example, recently reported in the French press, of a young man from Strasbourg who sent two completely identical curricula vitæ to the same company. The name on one was foreign-sounding and the other was typically French. You can guess which ‘applicant’ was invited for interview.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities. Instead we must get them out of this ghetto. Rather than concentrating on protecting minorities, we should be building the concept of European citizenship involving common values. We should be concentrating on building a common future for everyone and a society in which everyone can develop and which totally rejects any hint of submission to barbarism.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout its history Europe has been capable of the best and the worst. The best is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. The worst is colonialism, the Shoah, Stalinism and nazism. We must teach our children about all of this. We must clearly embrace everything which can strengthen Europe and reject anything which weakens it. At the same time we must send a clear message about the type of society we want to build. I will say plainly that those who regard as acceptable an alliance with extremists in order to win elections will be swept up and dumped in the dustbins of history. An alliance with the likes of Haider or Le Pen is like supping with the devil. You need a long spoon which will never be long enough. I would also remind those who advocate an ethnic concept of the nation that Clémenceau said that patriotism is the love of one’s country whereas nationalism is the hatred of others. These people have clearly chosen their side.</p>
<p class="contents">All these fine words must now lead to concrete action and practical legislative steps. Legislation against racism must be harmonised. The words must take on real meaning. Equal opportunities means allowing all children born on European soil to become European citizens and to enjoy the right of nationality of the country in which they are born.

However, it appears that we are not always completely sure which rights we are talking about and that we are introducing or we want to introduce rights which are not provided for in the Conventions or the international Treaties. For example, the right to immigration does not exist. Of course, an immigrant coming from outside the Union has the right to enjoy his rights, but imposing limits or controls on immigration cannot be classed as racism or xenophobia, for the very reason that there is no mention of a right to immigrate in any text. Moreover, the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable, if only for reasons of space and numbers. And, in addition, there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights. </p>
<p class="contents">For example, we have been talking about the Roma. Of course, the Roma have rights and should not be discriminated against, but many of them, and I am not saying the majority, but certainly a large number of them, as has been statistically proven, do not live lawful lives. Many of them abuse their women and, more importantly, their children. Ill-treated, ragged children are often to be seen on the streets, and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passers-by and to induce them to give them some money. Sadly, the authorities often turn a blind eye to this, in the same way that they turn a blind eye, or two blind eyes, to the other unlawful activities perpetrated by certain parties who do not pay taxes and who are not fully integrated into our society. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there seem to be free zones within our communities when it comes to some violations of human rights: for example, certain types of genital mutilation are very frequent and there needs to be more of a crackdown on them. </p>
<p class="contents">Now then, it is right for an immigrant to have rights, but it is also right for him to abide by the rules of the country in which he finds himself, for it must not be forgotten that European civilisation, which is a Christian civilisation, an enlightened civilisation, even though it is welcoming and open to other cultures, does have its own roots and must not be overwhelmed. We must take care that we do not become a minority ourselves, and that we do not become victims of discrimination here, in our own home.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Too much attention has gone into developing European powers in the field of human rights, of which, by all accounts, there are high expectations. Asylum policy has been dealt with extensively, so has the heading “life styles and types of relationships”. The rights of homosexuals have been given more attention than is necessary, and all kinds of requirements have been imposed on the Member States. What is remarkable, however, is the deafening silence when it comes to those who really are the weaker parties amongst us: the elderly, babies and the handicapped. And where does the right to life come in? And what about the protection of the family? </p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, the report is full of good intentions but is dogged by a view of man and society which is too individualistic. Nor does it do enough justice to the fact that life itself is worth protecting. </p>
<p class="contents">Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism must be stamped out. I fully share this view, which is expressed in the Ludford report. But in contrast to what is stated in the report, we cannot prevent racism and xenophobia by adopting a unilateral, positive approach to the multi-cultural society as a “source of social vitality”. This notion smacks of a naïve kind of intellectualism. The Netherlands has adopted such a policy over the past couple of years, aimed at bringing about a multi-cultural society. This did not turn out to be a success, as is evident from the “multi-cultural drama” which we now find ourselves in. Many immigrants have, as a result of this policy, ended up in a sub-class of society, with all the consequences that entails.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than putting our own culture into a multi-cultural context, I am in favour of developing a sound, realistic awareness of our own culture, taking both the positive and the negative aspects into account, which can lead to improved relations with each other and acceptance of the cultural differences on both sides. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, have, I am sorry to say, existed throughout the world since time immemorial. With this in mind, we should take the century-old Biblical commandment “love thy neighbour like thyself” to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, he has confirmed my contention that this action by the 14 lacks any justifiable basis, Mr Schulz.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also criticises the fact that Austria has not yet ratified the 1998 European Charter for Minority Languages. I should therefore like to point out that the ratification of the Charter for Minority Languages referred to is indeed an element of the government’s programme. The coalition has undertaken to table this before the <span class="italic">Nationalrat</span> (National Assembly) by January 2001, and the highly criticised government is continuing to burnish Austria’s already excellent image in the field of human rights.</p>

I will therefore simply set out the principles and analysis of our Group.</p>
<p class="contents">We have several basic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is not to take account of issues falling outside the time framework of this report which relates to 1998 and 1999. Any comments on the current political situation must therefore be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to prevent this report, as far as possible, from simply being a collection of objectives, pious hopes or conclusions based on false premises as these are not specific and verifiable rights which can be effectively exercised in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third principle is in line with the unchanging beliefs of the PPE-DE Group. Although we do not want to be less generous or less open to others than the rest of the groups, nevertheless we do not believe that the identified rights are truly appropriate. This has caused us to vote against certain rights which, although we consider them to be completely legitimate and worthy of support, are not appropriate in a report on the state of human rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also wanted to avoid, where possible, countries being mentioned or highlighted when the report on human rights for this year does not contain a systematic analysis of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue must also be viewed in the context of subsidiarity in that it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the protection of human rights and it is up to the national courts to punish any infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like the report for next year to take account of the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In this way, from next year, we will have a report in line with the real situation which will allow a country-by-country and right-by-right analysis to be carried out due to the simultaneous preparation of this Charter. The next report to be put to the vote should be awaited with even more trepidation and should clearly show the interest which our Union takes in human rights within our Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties. Animals have rights, children do not. Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market. The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters, the paedophiles and the pornographers, than to industrialists.</p>
<p class="contents">In a twenty-first century where we regard ourselves as civilised there is still a slave trade in which children are bought and sold for sexual exploitation throughout the world. We have problems in the candidate countries. We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government. We have pictures on our TV almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world. And of course, we have familiar tales of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take tougher action. We have to bring children up the agenda. This is not to say that the EU should start to be responsible for children's policy but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are child-proof. We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children's dimension. We should ensure that there is somebody in the Commission with responsibility for child matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998 my own government appointed a child rights expert from Save The Children to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop strategies and practical projects in relation to children's rights. Why can we not do the same?</p>
<p class="contents">We also have in Great Britain a Children's Select Committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses. Why can we not do the same? Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children? I know we have communications. We have action plans and conventions but what we want is action, not good intentions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Science, technology and communication have broadened man’s knowledge and expertise and abilities beyond belief. Yet, the world is still being plagued by human rights violations on a massive scale, mainly due to war, poverty and misuse of power. We should therefore concentrate all our efforts on these human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">But cultural value patterns underlie these violations too. Mrs Malmström was therefore right in asking, in her special report, that the position of the woman be given special attention. In a great many societies, the woman is still suffering at the hands of men as a result of institutionalised and sometimes legalised misuse of power. Not collective habits but the effects on the individual must be the overriding factor in our judgement. This means, for example, that we should not respect female circumcision as an old tradition but should fight it with all civilised means. European foreign policy is too easily thrown off course by purely economic interests. It is high time that human rights were given the priority they deserve, not only in theory but also in practice. In this way, Europe can make a substantial contribution to progress, progress of civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, the Union’s best tool for disseminating its human rights model is the experience of migrants. Yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people.</p>
<p class="contents">I can give you two examples of this. Firstly, there is cause for concern about the shape being taken by the readmission agreements which directly threaten fundamental rights such as the right of asylum or the right to live as a family. The Union has confirmed its attachment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions by establishing the anti-deportation principle. It is therefore unacceptable that the readmission agreements can allow a third country national to be returned to his or her country when we know that this country more often than not does not guarantee respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. It is just as unacceptable to see families torn apart with children sometimes being left alone following the expulsion of their parents who have no right of residence, even though some have lived and worked in Europe for nearly ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">What image of human rights do you think they will take back to their countries given their experiences of questionable living conditions, humiliating body searches, insults, endless forms and interrogations in police stations and detention centres? After all this, we then just end up sending them back to countries which they are legitimately seeking to leave, often for political and economic as well as humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">These readmission agreements are dangerous for asylum-seekers, for the dissemination of human rights throughout the world and for the international stature of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union wants to be taken seriously on the issue of respect for human rights, it must immediately stop these expulsions. It must legalise the situation of all these men and women who are deprived of all rights, including the right to live as a family and the right of free movement, and who are currently kept in a situation of official illegality.</p>
<p class="contents">Another flagrant attack on human rights concerns foreigners and citizenship. How can we expect third country nationals to integrate and their children to respect the law and to believe in the reality of democratic rights when they are not allowed to exercise these rights?</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the Union is considering the definition of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, why are we creating second-class citizens? This really is a case of fundamental rights. How can we allow some people to be excluded? How can they believe in the reality of the Declaration of Human Rights? On human rights, the Union could take pride in being the first in history to define citizenship according to a principle of residence instead of establishing discrimination based on nationality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The excellent reports by Mrs Malmström, Mrs Ludford and Messrs Haarder and Belder offer us Europeans the opportunity for analysis and, above all, self-criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">This year is especially significant. A year after waging war against Yugoslavia in the name of human rights, we have remained passive in the face of an even greater violation of these rights on the part of Russia in Chechnya. Two weeks ago, with the support of the United States, Spain and Great Britain allowed Pinochet to evade his responsibilities to face justice for his very grave violations of human rights. This year we have also seen a racist and xenophobic party enter government in Austria, and in Spain we have also seen an outbreak of racist violence in El Ejido. We have seen the mayor of that city receive 75% support in the elections there. This has also been the year in which the Catholic Church has issued a <span class="italic">mea culpa</span> on violations of human rights committed throughout history.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we in the European Union could develop a more constructive attitude. I therefore propose five points, which are the contributions of the GUE/NGL Group to the various reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to abandon all hypocrisy and treat all countries in the same way; secondly, to commit ourselves to defending, at all costs, human rights everywhere, including in the economic field, in factories; thirdly, to show a special concern for human rights throughout the world, in Latin America (in Mexico, in Argentina, in Peru) etc.; fourthly, to accept unreservedly the cause of human rights for women; and lastly, to recommend the ratification of the International Criminal Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not so much a question of what is said, and the more talk there is of human rights, the worse are the abuses. I want to make three small points. First of all, I completely agree with my fellow countryman and rapporteur for the report, Mr Haarder, when he says that, where the protection of minorities is concerned, we should make the same demands upon ourselves as we make upon the candidate States. This is something which the EU’s institutions should have thought about in 1991-1992 when, in contravention of the rules applicable to the protection of minorities, they recognised firstly Slovenia and subsequently Croatia and, in the process, added fuel to the flames of what subsequently became the Balkans disaster. The second point is an extension of yesterday’s debate. To insist on incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights into the EU’s constitution – or, rather, into the EU Treaty – would not merely entail a number of huge and insuperable constitutional problems, especially in a country like Denmark, but it would also make the EU Treaty into a genuine constitution incorporating fundamental rights. It is said that the more rights we have, the better, but rights are part and parcel of a complicated interplay of systems. The result of an EU Charter would be an endlessly complicated morass of legal and constitutional problems. Which is the decision-making authority? Are the rights guaranteed under the Convention on Human Rights better than those guaranteed under the EU’s Charter? Is the latter, again, better than the national constitutions? That is a question which has no meaning. Finally, my third remark is a compliment to the rapporteur, Mr Haarder. It is with satisfaction and much interest that I see that paragraph 61 emphasises the collective right to trade union membership. However, Mr Haarder’s old hobbyhorse about the individual’s right not to join a union is not included as a recommendation. I want to congratulate Mr Haarder on the new political insight on his part which is evidenced here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We particularly welcome the fact that the problem of religious freedom was mentioned, as some countries, especially the Czech Republic, have already passed very restrictive laws against religious minorities. The passage on the human rights situation within the EU is also interesting and gives the EU no cause whatsoever to take the moral high ground vis-à-vis new candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We Austrians now find ourselves in a situation, ostensibly in order to safeguard human rights, in which we no longer know whether to laugh or cry. A few weeks ago, taxi drivers in Brussels were refusing to take Austrian passengers. Austrians were thrown out of hotels and restaurants in Belgium and France. Our assistants’ French teachers declared that they no longer wished to teach Nazis and school exchange programmes were cancelled. Austrians working abroad had their cars vandalised, stones thrown at their houses and their children were threatened at school. Today it was revealed that the Austrian entrant in a show jumping competition in Grenoble had his invitation withdrawn. The town council in Grenoble held lengthy discussions on whether or not the horse was welcome but, in the end, its invitation was also withdrawn as it had not expressly distanced itself from the Austrian government.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we shall soon see Mozart banned from international opera houses. Who knows where it will all end. Whoever takes political responsibility for this anti-fascist Punch and Judy show here in the House and in the EU countries in question has cause to be proud. I can assure the previous speakers, who call me Satan’s sidekick, that I am not hiding a cloven hoof beneath the benches. If this irrational collective hatred against an entire nation can be so readily called upon in the EU, we are a long way from being in a position to dictate to other countries.</p>

<p class="contents">In our opinion, human rights cannot be envisaged without a political society and, in particular, without this supreme form of the peaceful political society which is the nation, in terms of both civil peace and balance between nations, and therefore international peace. Yet Europe is trying to build itself without this basic element and even to destroy this through its two fundamental aspects, namely <span class="italic">res publica</span> and sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by chance that the Declaration of Human Rights coincided in France with the affirmation of national sovereignty. De Gaulle rightly said that the first human right was national sovereignty for the simple reason that there is no point in having rights without a political society which is free from feudalism and empires. This society must therefore enjoy popular and national sovereignty which is precisely what the European project is slowly but surely destroying.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider it impossible to combat racism, antisemitism or xenophobia without making people into citizens and without detaching them, at least in political terms, from their membership of ethnic groups, or minorities to use the current term. We are seeing the re-emergence of this minority concept, not only in various reports of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also, very dangerously, in our own policies, such as that conducted in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">If the concept of ethnic groups and minorities is re-established, this will take us down a dangerous road towards individual membership rather than political and national membership. This Pandora’s box will ultimately destroy our continent which is why we feel it is pathetic to crow about human rights in a Community which is threatening, some time in the future, to take us into the worst decline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would stress that these remarks are out of place in a report on human rights. When we hold a debate on Austria, when we draw up a document on the Austrian situation – if Parliament judges it appropriate so to do – then we might even be able to give Baroness Ludford the task of drawing up a document which we will debate together. These remarks have no place in a document on human rights, as they should not be using up the time allocated to the Baroness’s report, and so they have acquired the bitter taste of political exploitation of a very serious issue such as human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something else on the subject of this report, regarding the right of Europeans to their own identity. Throughout the document, the identity of Europeans, of the European nations, is not once referred to in a positive sense but always as a possible framework for xenophobia and racism. I am a practising Christian who is sure of his beliefs: now, is this a reason to accuse me of xenophobia? On the contrary, xenophobia is more likely to be caused by a decline in religious convictions. Religion <span class="italic">per se</span> is a factor which promotes fraternity. I am a staunch Italian patriot, so, according to paragraph O of this document, I could be accused of xenophobia. This seems to me to be indicative of a cultural attitude which encourages xenophobia, for it encourages fear of globalisation, which prompts many local communities to become inward-looking and refuse dialogue, dialogue which takes identity into account. </p>
<p class="contents">We must make it clear that Europe does have a cultural identity, based on our Greek and Judo-Christian heritages and on enlightenment, which enters freely into dialogue with other identities. A multicultural Europe which does not include European culture would lead to disaster and its decline. This is not a not a question of black or white cultures: there is no connection between colour and culture. Culture is based on values, not colour. </p>
<p class="contents">There are many issues related to xenophobia and racism, but these must be dealt with by the local communities. It is not our place to define labour market quotas, or police or any other labour market quotas, and if we were to do so we would hinder integration, not encourage it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, are we really of the opinion that all those who are not in favour of completely uncontrolled immigration are racist? And do we really think that the Constitutions of all of our nations are racist because their criteria are different from those espoused by Baroness Ludford? These aspects of the report need to be evaluated carefully and many of them changed, or we will find it hard to obtain a general consensus in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me to be a very comprehensive report and to make some very striking points. I would like to draw the House’s attention to three key points concerning human rights as I see this issue at present.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these is the issue of water. The World Water Forum is about to take place in The Hague, at the end of this week to be precise. At this event, water will be treated as a rare economic commodity. This is serious, as whilst it may be true that water is becoming ever more important in economic terms, it is also true that the right to water is a human and social right for everyone. I would therefore like to draw honourable Members’ attention to precisely this issue, water, which is going to be one of the most hotly debated subjects this year. The situation is becoming ever more critical, but the right to water also has to be seen as a human right.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to mention today, very briefly, is the situation in Angola. The report says that attacks on human rights in Angola have been treated with too much diplomatic discretion. I believe that this is exactly what has happened – a veil of silence has been drawn over events in Angola, a country which has been in a state of permanent war for 40 years and at civil war for 25 years. We need to have a clearer and better informed view of events in Angola, as I said in this House when we were discussing the issue of attacks on journalists’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">But what worries me most, and what worries me most in Angola, is the issue of the rights of children forced to take part in the war by both sides, and the rights of women, who are the greatest victims of this ferocious war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer, Mr President, to point 38 and points 41 and 42 of the Haarder report. Point 38, which was amended for the worse by Amendment No 22, cited again today in the Chamber, imposes on Italy – and who knows why Italy should be singled out – in order to guarantee the impartiality of judges, not the separation of judicial and political authorities, as advocated by Montesquieu, but the separation, within the judiciary, of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates. The consequence of this absurd step is that, as is the case in Italy, anyone who is part of the judiciary as an investigating magistrate will become dependent upon the decision-making authorities, with the genuine risk that it will not be possible to conduct inquiries into corruption and the abuse of political power without fear of political pressure. </p>
<p class="contents">With reference to points 41 and 42, I appreciate the fact that no citizen, not even a male descendent of a former ruler, can be deprived of the freedom to enter the country of which he is a national, but I do not understand why this only applies to Italy and Austria: there are other Community States which have rulers and sons of rulers living abroad. In particular, with regard to Italy, to lay down a period of not more than six months within which to apply the sanctions would be against the Italian Constitution, which, in fact, provides for the adoption of a constitutional resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Candidate countries and their Members of Parliament, and I am thinking of many a member of the Turkish parliament, have a great deal to learn, such as how independent representatives of the people act and must act when it comes to human rights in their own country. We have to admit, however, that we still have a lot of homework to do. Self-criticism is not enough. It does us credit, but alone it does not suffice.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, in our reports, we condemn cases of torture and maltreatment of detainees or prisoners by the forces of order or officials in charge of executing sentences, we must admit that so far little has been done about it by those in a position of responsibility. The same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many Member States. How many more times do we intend to debate the conditions in numerous detention centres as a problem of which we are aware but which has yet to be regulated? If we want to win the people in the detention centres over to our society, then we must admit that most European detention centres are not at present suitably equipped for the task.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to criticise human rights violations and discrimination in candidate countries such as Turkey or some of the Eastern European countries when it comes to the Roma and other minorities, but that is precisely why we must set an example when it comes to human rights in the European Union. In this sense, thank you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be effective, the fight against discrimination requires broader and, in particular, more specific measures. Therefore, any restriction linked to nationality for access to civil service jobs must be abolished. The institutions of the Community and Member States must lead the way in this. In the same way, full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the European Union the right to vote in all elections. As long as these third country nationals are refused political rights, they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination. If their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right, why limit this to the local and European levels?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Europe the situation of all illegal immigrants must be legalised in order to fight against the traffic in labour and the xenophobic hatred which has recently been seen, in Spain, for example. This would mean breaking with the provisions of the Schengen, Amsterdam and Dublin Treaties which are real insults to the right of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the fight against racism does not really require a legal arsenal, however good this may be, but rather specific measures to eliminate unemployment and exclusion. This is where we expect to see progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments. We must show leadership as must the media, educational institutions and the churches; they have not shown such leadership in the past. Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little, too late. We are a continent that is sending USD 2 billion worth of weapons to drought-stricken Ethiopia and we cannot find a couple of helicopters to send urgently to save people drowning in Mozambique. It is a real shame on us and the other European institutions that we cannot respond to these kinds of disasters. Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month. Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions. There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq. Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported. It is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We should intervene with the Security Council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people. Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region. Shame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general. Racism is a crime – a crime that is not pursued in the Union, an offence against a law that is not enforced in the Union. It is something we have a great responsibility to do something about. We are not doing anything whatsoever about it.</p>

Unless we show them leadership and a sense of purpose, a sense of direction, they will make their judgements in the coming years.

This all revolves around the kind of philosophy on man and society people take their inspiration from, and Mr Belder has presented his in no uncertain terms. The report is based on the notion of the unity of the human species, a Christian teaching which forms a firm barrier against any lapses of a racist nature. Man could be seen as being created in the image of God. This should make it impossible to see one’s fellow man as a threat or to harm his dignity. Mr Belder quite clearly does not pursue the ideology, which is termed conservative by some, which defends the identity of communities against cultural influences from outside. An ideology of this kind, which overestimates the sense of community, contains insufficient guarantees against tendencies towards discrimination. I condemn such a conservative ideology. </p>
<p class="contents">The candidate Member States expect the European Union to be a constitutional community based on the common acceptance of values which are mostly of a Jewish-Christian origin. It is only logical that we should observe these values. This does not always accord with their and our gut reactions but that is – like it or not – the trademark of sound principles. They do not always turn out to be to our advantage. People have to overcome their fears and short-term interests. We need to help the candidate Member States in a critical, yet constructive, way and not be afraid to call a spade a spade. The Belder report contains a few concrete pointers in this respect. Churches, trade unions, women’s organisations, occupational training courses and other educational institutions, in particular, play a decisive role in this. My Group did not have any reason to table any more amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Ludford’s report, I belong to a minority in my Group who do not consider the report’s shortcomings serious enough to vote against it. It is true that proposals on voting rights for foreigners do not fit in at all in a report on xenophobia, but we do agree on the principle of drafting a recommendation in this respect. I have subscribed to this practice in the Netherlands for some 25 years, starting with the South Moluccans. I have no problem at all with providing them with government jobs. This may not be an ideological issue for me, but if you have a look at the EU delegations abroad, they are teeming with foreigners in EU service, even in sensitive functions. Governments do well to give ethnic minorities a visible presence in police forces, for example. In my opinion, it is extremely impractical to restrict the options in this respect, and I certainly do not want to see this become a requirement. What interest would be served in doing so? If the Ludford report is not changed for the worse by amendments, the minority which I represent here will vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that that he wishes to vote in favour of the Ludford report, but I am not so pleased at his contention that the European Union is a community of Christian values and I should like to correct that directly. Christianity contributes to the catalogue of values of the European Union, but there are also other currents which have found their way into the catalogue of values of the European Union and I think it is important that we establish this once and for all.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the debate on the Ludford and Haarder reports is concerned, allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my Group. Mr Haarder submitted an excellent draft report to the committee and the committee tabled 170 proposed amendments and 22 compromise amendments, making a total of 192 amendments. The committee spent days discussing them and then voted on a largely amended report and now we have another 69 proposed amendments here in plenary. There is nothing dramatic about this per se, but nearly half the proposed amendments are from the group which calls itself TDI: the Technical Group of Independent Members.</p>

These ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee. They never take part in detailed discussions of the problems. Why then do we always have these proposed amendments in plenary? The answer is in their speeches, which we have already had the pleasure of here today. They want to use this forum to bring their platitudes to the attention of as wide an audience as possible throughout the world. Technical work, no thank you. Simplified rabble-rousing, yes please. That is the political strategy of the extreme right in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I wish to address is this: when we discuss the human rights situation inside the European Union, then, as Mr Ceyhun rightly said, what we are discussing is the introspection which we are obliged to engage in if we wish to discuss human rights violations in other parts of the world and if we want to tell candidate countries that we are critical of ourselves, that we get out our own measuring rod when it comes to respect for human rights at home. This is important, because only those who are critical of themselves have the right to criticise others.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why these reports, both Baroness Ludford’s antiracism report and Mr Haarder’s human rights report, pave the way. The annual debate on these matters paves the way for the basic political orientation of the European Union. And when I learn that these reports are being abused for prosaic domestic policy considerations, then those who practise this abuse are ill-advised. I refer to Article 38 of the Haarder report on separating the careers of judges and investigating magistrates, on which Mr Cornillet, who is present here, has tabled an amendment which, basically, is about the careers of judges and investigating magistrates in Italy. I just wonder what that has to do with human rights. Anyone who abuses a human rights report in order to make national domestic policy has missed the point completely.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the fuss in points 41 and 42 about Savoyard princes being allowed to enter Italy is concerned, I fail to see exactly how human rights are being violated. Anyone who wants to hold a serious discussion on human rights in the EU should talk about human rights and not abuse these valuable and excellent reports for tactical domestic policy games.</p>

The Italian Constitution is the result of the great historical agreement between all the democratic forces which fought against fascism and to liberate Italy during the Second World War. It is intolerable that the European Parliament should ask us to breach the provisions of this Constitution, which is one of the most democratic and advanced Constitutions in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it should be remembered that the House of Savoy not only welcomed the fascist dictatorship and supported the fascist attack on democratic Spain and the fascist imperialist war against Ethiopia, but that it also permitted the alliance with Hitler’s racist regime, going so far as to apply the shameful anti-Semitic laws in Italy. Once Italy and the whole of Europe had been caught up in the catastrophe of the Second World War, the royal family fled from Rome and shamefully abandoned the Italian troops to their fate, leaving them without orders or leaders at the time of the armistice with the allied forces. Moreover, the House of Savoy has never acknowledged the sovereignty of the Republic or the irrevocable nature of the decision to create a Republic, which is enshrined in the Constitution. Mr President, we have no hesitation or uncertainty in rejecting the request, which is unexpected in this context, to breach the Italian Constitution. We have no hesitation in reiterating that there is no room in my country for the descendants of the former kings of Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are invited to achieve a more ethnically diverse workforce which will require, in the first instance, all staff to be identified by ethnic origin. I, for example, am of Parisian origin and I am concerned about how we can be sufficiently represented in the EU bodies and about how we can practically establish records on ethnic origin which will allow this ethnic diversity to be monitored.

<p class="contents">As an academic, a teacher of the languages and civilisations of the Far East prior to my entry into politics and the former dean of a faculty where twenty-eight foreign languages and civilisations were taught, I do not regard myself as a xenophobe. Yet I must say that all this supposedly antiracist talk has some common features, the first of which is intellectual invalidity and the second the destruction of liberty.</p>
<p class="contents">This talk is intellectually invalid because the terms used are not even defined. What are racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extremism? What do these concepts cover? What are their philosophical origins? What doctrines do they involve? Do those accused of these acts deserve this opprobrium? No one knows or wants to know because, if these terms were defined, this would weaken their real purpose which is to paralyse hearts and minds by constant repetition of the same generalisations and by the threat of demonising those not stepping into line.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is really to fraudulently make patriotic sentiment seem to be expansionist nationalism, the legitimate refusal of migration policy to be xenophobia and the desire of nations to preserve their identity to be racism. This is completely absurd. Racism is the desire to achieve the domination of one race over another. Who is racist in Europe nowadays? Xenophobia is the rejection of a foreign presence. You can morally condemn this but, politically speaking, you should consider that, in its literal meaning, xenophobia is the source of all the national liberation movements which we have praised at other times.</p>
<p class="contents">As for antisemitism which is apparently re-emerging in Europe, why not ask the real questions? The proposition made in a book by the left-wing philosopher, Jean­Paul Sartre, according to which the Jew is basically an artificial creation of the antisemite is clearly false, like the rest of this philosopher’s thinking. However, could the opposite proposition not be true, namely that certain Jewish circles need antisemitism in order to exist, to strengthen their identity and even to assert their moral, political and even financial authority?</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly what is stated by certain intellectually honest and courageous Jews who go so far as to deplore the perverse reminders of the only persecution of the Jews during the Second World War, known globally under the vague and religious term of ‘Shoah’. These daily, obsessive, exclusive and sometimes frenzied reminders of this persecution are for political and financial purposes which no longer have any connection with the worship of the dead and their remembrance.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants … Mr Schulz, my family never accepted any German capo. This will not start with you! … It is rather a question of nipping in the bud any vague desires which nations might have to oppose the destruction of their identity. The religion of antiracism has its dogmas, its priests, its inquisitors and its witch-hunts. History will roundly condemn the protagonists of this shameful ideology which we are proud to fight at any time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights, twenty years after the Helsinki Final Act, ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and one year after the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, there are constitutional provisions remaining in the heart of Europe which belong to the medieval age – provisions which have no place in a modern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his native Italy as an uncomprehending nine-year old child, and for fifty-three years has been unable to return. If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters, coastguards are mobilised using modern satellite technology instructing him with loudspeakers to turn back. His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather. The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane. What has he got to do with what his great-grandfather did during the Fascist era? 80% of Italians in a recent poll believe these people should be allowed to return without restrictions. Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State. This is not, as some have tried to claim, an issue affecting only a few people; it goes to the heart of the European Union's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights, to its own Treaties and to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this Parliament does not first do all it can to address existing Treaty violations. I speak as someone with a deep and abiding love for Italy and its people, but I say here to you today, and to President Ciampi of Italy, that Italy had neither the moral nor the legal right to sign the Treaty of Amsterdam until it had removed this most blatant violation of the Convention from its own constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria. The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view. The Treaty does not discriminate against individual families and the Treaty is therefore violated. The right to enter, live and die in your own country are fundamental, sacrosanct rights and I hope that this Parliament will uphold them. I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what it says in the Treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of. It is therefore to be welcomed that every year, the European Parliament issues a report on respecting human rights within the European Union itself. Although I did not join the European Parliament until last year, I happen to know that the handling of this annual human rights report has, over the past couple of years, always met with a great deal of political commotion and confusion. The commotion is justified, given the nature of the topic, but the confusion is not. I am therefore particularly delighted that this year, a report has been produced which is very well balanced and to the point, except for one single industrial accident which Mr Schulz has already mentioned and with regard to which we are having to sit and witness some rather despicable displays at times. Fortunately, we can show our disagreement by drumming our fingers on our tables. Apart from this, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Bertel Haarder, for the huge commitment he has shown and the constructive cooperation which I have received from him as shadow rapporteur for the socialist group. Thanks to our discussions, I have gained a much deeper insight into the complexity of the matter and I would especially praise him here in public for his openness. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content of the report is concerned, I would like to outline a few topics. Is it not rather ironic that it is precisely asylum and migration issues, which are at the very top of the political agenda in Europe, that have been echoed so clearly in this report? Should, in fact, the European policy on asylum and migration not lead to fewer human rights violations in this field? To ask the question is to answer it. It is wise to remain vigilant when it comes to observing human rights of the extensive minorities in Europe. People from these groups, more often than not economically vulnerable, run the considerable risk of becoming victims of discrimination. The reality is that millions of people live in poverty in our rich and privileged Europe. The report quite rightly describes this issue of poverty and disadvantage in terms of human rights, and this seems to be a step in the right direction. </p>
<p class="contents">The report also devotes attention to the issue of the equal treatment of men and women and the equal treatment of different types of relation and life styles, more so than in previous years. Free choices which people make in their private lives, and which do not harm anybody, should be honoured, with respect for diversity and with a guarantee of the principle of equal treatment. As is evident from the amendments, the battle is not over yet, not by a long shot. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there are still many people, some of which are in this House if this debate is anything to go by, who would like to give preferential treatment to marriage and family and, as such, openly insult and discriminate against anyone making a different choice in their private lives. My Group, on the other hand, considers the principle of equality sacrosanct. After all, human rights are there for everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights are, of course, indivisible and independent of political parties and national borders. It is therefore important that we in this Parliament should obtain broad agreement on this issue, for a right cannot, of course, be universal if half of Parliament is opposed to it. I should especially like to thank Mrs Swiebel, both for her friendly words today and for the intense collaboration which we have had and which has naturally given her considerable influence. I should like to tell her that I am also delighted to vote for the further amendments which she has tabled and which we shall be voting on tomorrow. I should also, however, like to thank Mr Pirker and Mrs Palacio. I should like to express my gratitude for the broad agreement we have obtained in connection with this report. I think this is commendable, especially this year when human rights have been so high on the agenda of the European Union. Finally, I would say to Mr Krarup that he must withdraw his expression of delight at the change in paragraph 61, because this was an error pure and simple.

I agree with this criticism, despite the fact that, as chairman of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I risk receiving yet another protest letter from Beijing asking whether the European Parliament is waging a hostile campaign against China.

<p class="contents">The reports direct criticism towards twenty or so countries outside Europe and towards almost all EU and candidate countries. In fact, I am considering sending the reports to the EU committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing and suggesting that they do something similar. How about a self-critical report from the National People's Congress on human rights in China and a report on human rights in the world and in the EU, as seen from a Chinese point of view?

<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union turns a blind eye to situations in which human rights are being savagely violated when, of course, it comes to protecting its imperialistic interests. Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example. The recent and continuing invasion in Kosovo, using the rights of minorities as a pretext, and the unbelievable demands being made on Yugoslavia are a typical example of how military intervention is being advanced as a general principle of international law at the expense of the principle of national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the policy being exercised by the European Union at home basically violates a series of fundamental human rights. Political and social rights are being hit and individual rights and democratic freedoms are being trampled underfoot.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of this policy are already visible in the support being given to extremist, racist, Fascist powers, and not just in Austria. And yet the report on the fight against racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the people to step up their fight to stop their self-proclaimed saviours trampling on the rights for which they have fought hard and made sacrifices, and to reverse the current trend, which only serves the interests of those who are exploiting them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, since I have had the honour of working with him on previous annual reports on human rights, I know how difficult it is. I hope that he receives the broad support of this House that he has asked for. He deserves it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, at the beginning of his first intervention, Mr Haarder said that Europe did not invent human rights, and that is true. However, what does characterise Europe is the fact that, having moved them from the private realm into the public realm by making them actionable, it has made human rights the flag, the distinguishing mark which characterises us as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about the defence of these human rights and I would now like to insist that if we proclaim human rights, it naturally follows that we must ensure that those rights can be exercised. I support all the points that have been made and I would like to add another. I am talking about those people who cannot exercise their rights because they are under pressure from certain quarters, certain organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give just one example. Recently, the members of the <span class="italic">Foro de Ermua</span> [Ermua Forum] visited us and I would like to remind the House that these members come from all sections of the political spectrum, ranging from left to right. They are intellectuals, they are men and women who live in the Basque Country and who cannot exercise their rights, their right to freedom of expression, because they constantly feel under pressure from <span class="italic">Herri Batasuna</span>, the political wing of ETA.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one more example: last Sunday the Basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote. Fortunately, Basque society voted en masse, displaying the courage which is so essential in that environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end as I began: this House must state loud and clear that the most important element of respecting human rights is the defence of the exercise of those rights – in full – in all cases and particularly in the face of those forces and organisations which hinder freedom of expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important topic. It is crucial for the construction of a peaceful and harmonious Europe, a Europe united in its objective and at ease with itself and its citizens. That is certainly what we, on this side of the House, believe. That is what this report aims to do. But the EPP it seems, and others opposite, clearly do not want that. We heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from Mr Gollnisch on behalf of his party. Mrs Palacio, who is just leaving, has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core. And yet, by their amendments to the Ludford report, they seek to divide Europe and to make millions of our brothers and sisters from the ethnic minorities second-class citizens. That is the clear aim of the amendments in the name of Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleagues and this is consistent throughout all the amendments on behalf of the EPP – the so-called European People's Party – which actually reveals itself in its amendments as a party for some of the people but not all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The EPP's amendments seek to divide families. They object to family unity. Their Amendment No 12 seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in Europe. The EPP, it seems, do not accept that ethnic minorities feel alienated from the electoral process. They do not feel that the European Parliament and national parliaments should reflect Europe's diverse ethnic nature. That is the aim of Amendment No 13. It deletes that from the report. They are against ethnic diversity and they do not accept the benefits given to our society by all its people. They do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot complain about what is going on in the candidate states if we have amendments like this being put forward in the European Union. Nor, it seems, does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote. Their Amendment No 21 deletes the call for encouragement to the ethnic minority to take part in elections to vote or stand as candidates. Is that what we want? I do not think it is. We, on this side of the House, reject that position completely. We will publicise the EPP position and their amendments whether they are passed or not. We deplore the line that Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleague have put forward. We urge the Liberal Group to dissociate themselves from their links with the EPP over the amendments because it has shown itself to have racist instincts in its party.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the EPP amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report. The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment. It would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support. It would be a retrograde step. So, I urge all colleagues to reject the amendments put forward by the European People's Party and their colleagues on the far right.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to clear up a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, nowhere does this report say that fighting racism means you should have no immigration controls. It says that such controls should not be racially discriminatory and should avoid fuelling xenophobic attitudes or hostility to ethnic minorities. The references to enhanced rights for third country nationals means, of course, rights for those who are legally resident.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on religion and identity, there is an assertion that there is no exclusivity. I agree with Mr Schulz. Christianity has been an important contributor to European values but it does not hold a monopoly on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, reference has been made to quotas. Nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned. As a liberal I am opposed to quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on Austria, the assertion is made that we should not mention Austria because of the time-frame of the report. This report is the annual debate on racism in the year 2000. It refers to where we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the remarks of Mr Oostlander, and I welcome his support for the report. As a gesture of goodwill I will be accepting five small amendments from the EPP, though incidentally none of those mentioned by Mr Evans. I very much hope that more members of the EPP/ED Group will support this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the atrocities in the Balkans that we spoke of earlier and much of the racism and antisemitism is because communities everywhere have not been allowed the ability, in line with the concept of subsidiarity, to develop within their own communities the democracy that people need everywhere if they are to evolve and create within their own regions and nations, the social rights, justice, respect for minorities, coexistence of different people and respect for every race and people.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty, President, still confines subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and the Member States. Regions and stateless nations are ignored. People within their own communities therefore suffer. They are unable to establish the structures they need so that human rights can prosper and the blight of racism can be forever removed.</p>
<p class="contents">In own nation, Wales, for example, we have no empowerment to establish our own laws to counter racism and defend human rights. The principles of cohesion and the drive to limit poverty and depravity in our communities are a well-settled concept in the European Union. However, it must encompass respect for minorities everywhere if it to inspire the world in its drive towards defeating racism and defending human rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More and more, we need to follow our words with actions. Disrespect for human rights, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are not confined to other continents, but are also present here, within ourselves, our lives and our institutions. Even in this Parliament, fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed. We must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other. We will be able to intervene more effectively in countries which deny the existence of human and social rights – whether these are the rights of Kurds, Palestinians, Chechens or the rights of Afghan women – if we avoid hypocrisy. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe is full of Haiders. We are Haiders when, to give the minor example of an incident which took place in Rome last week, Bosnian Roma refugees are deported with the approval of the mayor and sent back without aid to places of conflict; children and mothers, brothers and sisters separated, without even the time to gather together any belongings to take with them; children born in Italy snatched away from their schools where they have become integrated and made good friends with the other pupils. We are Haiders when, in Rome, parties of the right-wing opposition and the new centre incite the people to hatred and prevent the authorities from accommodating the Roma safely in places with running water and electricity. And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants. </p>

As far as these candidates are concerned, and this has already been said, we must avoid creating the impression that we demand higher standards of them than we meet ourselves. We should compare the actual situation in these countries with the reality in our own countries rather than with our perfect legal texts, otherwise the candidate countries will always come off worse in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly nobody contests the fact that candidate countries which, for example, only acquired their independence recently, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have the right to redefine and articulate their own national identity first. As the Communist dictatorship under which they previously suffered obviously did not foster a culture of pluralist debate, many forms of expression of national identity appear to us to be overstretched or even to be directed, indirectly, against minorities within the country or in one or more neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not look down from our high moral horse and condemn this phenomenon as long as it is only a question of temporary manifestations on the path towards self-definition. However, we should give these countries <span class="italic">en route </span>to the EU the specific support that they require so that the self-awareness which they need to find is not based first and foremost on negative restrictions on minorities or neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of a positive development between two sections of the population which is by no means self-evident. It is not self-evident given their history of illegal occupation and deportation and the politically motivated transfer of people into their countries, accompanied by the suppression of every expression of national self-determination up to the end of the 1980s. The fact that the Russian tanks which withdrew in 1994 were often daubed with the words “We’ll be back!” did little to foster understanding between the Baltic states and Russia. And yet, despite this history, there has not been one single incident of violent clashes between the majority and minority sections of the population since they regained independence. We should therefore voice to the Estonians and Latvians our express recognition of the fact that they have managed to keep a cool head and that they are receptive to our arguments when it comes to adapting their legislation in this area to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore take the view that the express call to continue measures to integrate the Russian minority contained in point 14 of the Belder report is unnecessary. This is already happening. This express reference creates the erroneous impression that this is not the case.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, a social climate is developing – and it made its appearance in a wing of our House this morning – which suggests that the protection of human dignity, respect for those who are different, democratic values and social solidarity have not yet been fully mastered.</p>
<p class="contents">Our action to foster respect for human rights and create a fair society of creative coexistence therefore needs to be examined against a backdrop of policies and measures which seek to improve economic and social conditions for everyone and combat unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The new multicultural Europe needs a policy which ensures that immigrants and different social groups and minorities are integrated into the social, political and economic life of national societies. What we need is a common European asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian values.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the education sector is also important and we need huge improvements in education for the children of immigrants and gypsies. At the same time, the mass media need to help fight prejudices and to demonstrate the beauty of modern multicoloured, multicultural society. Of course, within this framework, respect for those who are conscientious objectors, for example, and who do not therefore wish to serve in the army, should be guaranteed. I should like to take this opportunity of assuring the European Parliament that the problem which used to exist in Greece no longer exists, following the adoption and application of legislation on 1.1.98. The reference in question, therefore, in Mr Haarder’s otherwise excellent report, is therefore irrelevant today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
