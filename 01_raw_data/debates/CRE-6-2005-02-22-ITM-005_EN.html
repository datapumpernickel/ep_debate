<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, nearly 20 years ago, on 13 June 1985, the idea of the European Capital of Culture was submitted to the Council of Ministers of Culture at the instigation of Melina Mercouri, the then Greek Minister of Culture, and the relevant resolution was duly adopted. Her aim was to make specific cultural aspects of the city, region or country concerned accessible to the European public. After 20 years of the European Capital of Culture programme, we can draw some conclusions, as identified in the Palmer study of August 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that being selected as a European Capital of Culture has a positive impact on the city concerned as regards new cultural initiatives, the expansion of cultural infrastructure, artistic endeavours and trends, its reputation, its international status and the scope for further cultural development. This goes hand-in-hand with an increase in the number of visitors and receipts, but also in expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Capital of Culture has a special attraction for people interested in culture, the European aspect has not totally caught on. The cultural dimension is often overshadowed by political ambitions, and the European dimension has not always been in the forefront. The Capital of Culture can only be a sustainable project if it is integrated into the development of the city as part of a long-term cultural development strategy. A great deal has changed over the last 20 years as regards cultural and artistic development in cities, particularly in the European Union, making it necessary to amend the decision adopted at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the sequence of cities to be nominated up to 2019 does not take account of the 10 new Member States which joined the EU on enlargement in May last year. However, in order not to upset the sequence that has now been established, there is a proposal that for each year a city from one of the new Member States should be added in, so as to create a balance. We could not justify making these countries wait until 2019 for their turn.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position before us is deficient in some respects and does not meet all the requirements needed to implement the changes in a more open, democratic and transparent way. However, in order not to jeopardise the preparatory work in hand for the cultural capitals in 2009, 2010 and subsequent years – and especially those in Austria and Germany – I would urge you to approve this common position at second reading, on condition that the Commission, which has already promised this and has started work on it, brings forward a new draft by June this year at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal should meet the following requirements: the level of financial resources will need to be adjusted if there are to be two cultural capitals as from 2009; the present level of financial commitment ranges from EUR 200 000 and EUR 1 million per project. Clear criteria need to be established in order to provide the highest level of funding possible. At present, an average of EUR 500 000 is granted per cultural capital, which in the case of a budget proposal such as that being put forward by Linz corresponds to a contribution of 0.83%. The European Union is certainly not making a generous contribution here. I would plead for a fixed contribution of EUR 1 million per cultural capital if all the criteria have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be taken into account as regards the financial endowment and in the cultural programme, and in the 2007-2013 financial perspective. Furthermore, we regard it as very important for the role of the jury to be strengthened, for tasks to be more specifically defined and for the selection procedure for the applicant cities to be improved in this way. Clear and objective selection criteria for the cities themselves and the required added value for Europe also need to be explicitly defined and associated with specific points. The decision as to when and why a city should receive EUR 200 000, EUR 500 000 or EUR 1 million also needs to be clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Where competition between several cities is possible, that is to be welcomed, but it should not be an absolute criterion. For example, in 2009 Austria and Lithuania will enter the race with only one city each, but they will need to comply absolutely with the criteria of the selection procedure. This is very important, and I believe that with Graz, Austria has demonstrated that you can offer very good performance with a single city.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union should also support greater publicity for the cultural capitals and should bring forward a stronger programme in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the 1999 decision on the European Capital of Culture, the objective of the programme is to highlight the wealth and variety of European cultures – as well as what they have in common – and to contribute towards better mutual understanding on the part of Europe’s citizens. The new decision is intended to go one step further and to accept and emphasise the challenges of European integration, of European diversity and also that of expanding cultural cooperation within an enlarged Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Decision covered the years 2005-2019, which is where we are now. The sole purpose of the Commission’s proposal, which you have before you now, is to enable the ten new Member States to participate in this cultural activity as soon as possible from a position of parity with the other Member States, thus applying the principle of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, beginning in 2009, the new Member States will be hosting the European Capital of Culture, both in cooperation and in competition with the other Member States. In 2009, as already mentioned, it will be Lithuania together with Austria. In the second phase, as requested by the European Parliament, I am proposing a further change to the Council before this summer, which will mean an in-depth analysis or an in-depth review of the selection procedure for this Community activity.</p>
<p class="contents">As was rightly pointed out by Christa Prets, this proposal should include, among other things, the European dimension in cooperation, how to strengthen it, the role of the selection panel, national competition and so on. In actual fact, many of these questions or concerns have already been raised in the first reading and I shall of course take them into account when formulating the next steps to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also take account of the results of an independent study which has looked at the last 10 years of this cooperative venture. As regards the second reading, I am delighted that the report has also been accepted by the Committee on Culture and Education, thus approving the joint position of the Council, which is along the same lines as the Commission’s proposal. This means that this decision can be made relatively quickly, but of course on the basis of correct procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur Christa Prets personally for her close cooperation in these matters and of course I should also like to express my thanks to the Irish and Danish Presidencies over the last year in this matter and to the Luxembourg Presidency for its continuing cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that this change is bringing real results, since its adoption may significantly assist and directly affect relations between cities and citizens in the enlarged European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only ministers can come up with such ideas: the Members of this House were already wiser back then.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to put matters right today, and we are ready to support that. In future we will have two cities, one from the 15 old Member States and one from the new Member States. I totally support that, as it will also mean cooperation between two cultural capitals. In 2010, for example, that will involve a German city and a Hungarian one. Mrs Prets is of course quite right in saying that the financial resources will not be adequate for this. Once you have made a mistake, the punishment is that much more severe. In short, we will need more money for the cultural capitals in future, and that should also be provided under the financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, unlike Mrs Prets, that each country should submit at least two cities to the European jury for selection. Taking Germany as an example, I would like to remind you just how much excitement and creativity has been generated in the German cultural world over the last few years because ten cities have been competing to become the European Capital of Culture. We have witnessed enormous inventiveness, with the full range of cultural and economic players taking part in seminars and symposia. I simply believe that this amazing level of activity will only come about if there is competition between cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany will now be presenting two or more cities to the jury, of which only one can be selected. But all the others that applied have stirred up an incredible amount of excitement in their city, in their <span class="italic">Land</span> and in the surrounding area. That is why I believe this is the right way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply ask that in future the jury should pay more attention to what might be called the beacon effect of these cities. Europe’s cities are the beacons of our history and of our cultural diversity. Each cultural capital should particularly highlight this by arranging many and diverse events, not only to support national traditions and tourism, but also to truly highlight cultural diversity. I hope that the Commissioner will take account of these points in his new proposals, including those on the selection procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the idea of enlarging the European Capital of Culture initiative to include the new Member States. Some people perhaps think it would be better to have only one Capital of Culture per year, alternating yearly between the EU 15 of the old Member States and the EU 10 of new Member States. In this way, we could ensure that all the events are concentrated in one city. That would be a logical solution, but many old Member States have already waited a long time to enjoy the prestige and to have the possibility of having a Capital of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">This doubling of the possibilities should be welcomed subject to one crucial condition: the two capitals should be equal in every way, including finance. It is the responsibility of the Commission, the governments and the city councils, as well as of the media. I urge everyone to understand this concern and make every possible step to ensure equality in real terms. To have first-rate and second-rate Capitals of Culture could destroy the whole idea and would be a source of frustration and anger.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010, Hungary and Germany will host and provide a site for the Capital of Culture of Europe. In Hungary, 11 cities are competing for this wonderful chance to show themselves off to Europe. My home town, Budapest, is one of the candidates. Frankly, Budapest, even without a title, is one of the permanent culture capitals with its flourishing cultural life, but this possibility would be a special occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is amazing to see that in all 11 Hungarian cities, the local politicians, NGOs, citizens young and old, are very active in the common cause of the contest. In this way, the contest itself offers a chance for common cultural activities in all the competing cities. Provided there is equality of the two capitals, I welcome the initiative and the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You can always find individual areas where things could be done still better, but all in all we have seen that for all these cities the process of self-understanding – with meetings across Europe opening their eyes to European horizons – has helped to strengthen not only the identity of those cities but also a new understanding within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Pack was quite right to say that we now recognise that it was a mistake not to include Eastern Europe in the decision adopted in 1999. So we are right to be correcting that error here now and to provide for a new arrangement as from 2009, on the basis of which not just one country from the old Member States but also a city from one of the Eastern European Member States is also included.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that this tension between Western and Eastern Europe will lead to good cooperative projects. We also need to bear in mind that something like a new collective cultural identity is created in the individual cities. Europe has not just one soul, but many, and that is what the European cultural capitals should demonstrate in coming years. For that reason I agree with the proposals brought forward by Mrs Prets, both as regards resources and as regards clarity about how these cities are to be identified and nominated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The title ‘European Capital of Culture’ provides European cities and their citizens with an attractive opportunity to make themselves known across Europe, and also to display their cultural, scientific, architectural and historical merits and achievements. Against the background of their application to become a cultural capital, many cities have developed their own development plan, and these development plans, regardless of whether these cities have subsequently been nominated by their countries or not, give a tremendous boost to development. It leads to work on their infrastructure and to restoration, modernisation and renovation. Furthermore, it means that opportunities for the development of additional tourism are opened up, opportunities that subsequently also give these cities greater potential for development and a chance to present themselves in an attractive light.</p>
<p class="contents">If you take Germany as an example, where 10 cities are applying for 2010, including Potsdam, the capital of my own <span class="italic">Land</span>, Brandenburg, you can see even now, in 2005, the commitment the <span class="italic">Länder</span> are showing in their work to present these cities during the preselection period.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one comment on the proposal regarding the future competition. I can very well imagine that it would be possible for each country whose turn it is to nominate at least two cities. I would not, however, think it would be a good thing to nominate five, six, seven or eight of them – that would be too much. What we do need, though, is identical preselection criteria in the Member States and in the European Union, meaning that the jury would have to work according to the same criteria. I think this is extremely important and I therefore think we should pursue this idea. The title ‘European Capital of Culture’ is one that really is tremendously important for many cities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the idea of a famous actress and Greek Minister for Culture who, in her Oscar-winning song 'Never on Sunday', made Piraeus the cultural capital of the world during the 1960s.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe culture is the primary product in Europe, taking precedence over the economy, the army and diplomacy. Come and make history with the proposal which I am going to make to you, Commissioner. Let us make the 'dead city' of Ammohostos next year's capital of culture, the only dead city on our continent, our continent of grand civilisations, of the Mycenaean civilisation, of the Minoan civilisation, of the Roman civilisation. Ammohostos has been a dead city for 30 years and is the only dead city in the world. Come and let us make it the capital of culture, come and let us breathe life into a city which barbarity has deprived of life. Come and let us make it the capital of culture and win where all the plans have lost including, a few months ago, the Annan plan. If we make Ammohostos the capital of culture, you will see a Greek Cypriot student marching in procession with a Turkish Cypriot student and we shall all be proud. We shall be proud because we shall bring peace and we shall bring life to the most beautiful city in the Mediterranean. It is a good idea: for us to take decisions where diplomacy cannot, for us to take decisions where denial is particularly distressing. Come and let us give real meaning to this initiative. It is an important matter; Mr Figel opens up this city and the main square will one day be renamed Jean Figel Square. Try to help us do honour to this idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today I speak as the representative of a city in Ireland that is the present capital of culture: Cork. Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork's nomination, one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union. After the most recent enlargement that diversity is even greater and has expanded across the whole continent. That is why I particularly welcome the decision to have two capitals of culture operating in the east and west, as it were, of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">One key element that is lacking with regard to the overall structure is the financial support available to cities to undertake the necessary infrastructural work required to meet the demands for capital of culture status. Of course, governments and local authorities can give monies to their own cities, but there is a wider European dimension which requires extra financing at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is relation to these capitals of culture is that when we speak about culture we do not just think in highbrow terms of classical orchestras, ballet and music, although of course these should be included, but that we also recognise the ancient cultures and traditions which exist within each of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given that large countries such as Germany have sought to maintain unanimity for all decisions, we have now chosen a complicated system, which will be – although I hope not – burdened with excessive bureaucracy, and will take no account of the jury’s opinion when deciding between candidate cities. We saw the example of Patras, on 6 May of last year, which was named European capital of culture for 2006 by unanimous Council decision, despite the jury’s opinion to the contrary. Perhaps this is more a case of an interinstitutional malaise that goes beyond the framework of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, not least for all the financial benefit that she has brought. These decisions are now, of course, in the hands of the Commission, which must incorporate new ideas into its proposals. I suggest that the Commissioners should take greater account of the mobility factor, given that the capital of culture also offers an opportunity to display the culture of others. The added value to the region, the sustainability of the proposed projects and the groundwork carried out are further factors that should be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Luxembourg objects somewhat to Mrs Pack’s criticisms, because we have, already for 2007, named the city of Sibiu – a town in another country, Romania, a candidate country – as partner city. Luxembourg has expanded its project across the entire region – Sarre, Rhénanie-Palatinat, Wallonie, Lorraine and the German-speaking part of Belgium – in other words, five regions and three different languages. Analysis of the achievements of ‘Luxembourg, capital of culture 2007’, based on the concept of culture in a large region and aimed at fostering cohesion among the citizens, will also offer a glimpse of the future.

During its 20-year history, the Capital of Culture project has proved to be a success. In many cities, people have become involved who would not otherwise participate. Lowering the threshold and broadening the cultural arena is therefore a positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not broaden the scope of the Capital of Culture idea, however? Currently, 70% of us live in cities. The city is our closest cultural environment. However, cities have all too often been built mainly as traffic hubs. Noise and pollution levels therefore rise to inhumane proportions. Most Central Europeans have to put up with permanent noise pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Noise and pollution have become significant cultural factors. Commissioner, cities should be developed into the cultural hubs of a knowledge-based economy, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy. We are evolving into a digital network-aided cultural society. A Capital of Culture is hardly likely to grow up around a lorry terminal. For this reason, I do hope that in future the Capital of Culture will organise development seminars and planning competitions for the cities of today and tomorrow. Models should be built showing what a city in the cultured network society should be like.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cities have grown as physical traffic hubs dating from the Middle Ages, but this period ended centuries ago. Now we are living in a global digital networked environment. A global digital networked environment. Should not that mean changing the nature of cities and their cultures, and the models we present of them? What do you think, Commissioner Figel – are we stepping into the future? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe’s increased size following the latest enlargement clearly justifies the idea of designating two European Capitals of Culture per year. Yet, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already pointed out, Community financing must be adequate and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Capital of Culture is a highly prestigious award, but the city concerned is not expected to use European Capital of Culture funding from the Community for urban regeneration or other works of that ilk. The funding specifically earmarked for the programme is expected to help to highlight its role as a European city and as a cultural hub. Nor is the European Capital of Culture event expected to turn into yet another international festival, however significant.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do expect is that visitors should be offered a stimulating, accurate and lively image of the city that is awarded the designation and that is opening its doors. This image must be one that offers a rich contribution to European culture and to Europe’s relationship with the world, one that provides an insight into the city’s particular values and history, its spiritual and material heritage, its traditions and customs, and the unique character of its people – that is, the city’s human side.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the report by Mrs Prets and, in general, what has been said by previous speakers. I should also like to suggest that these points be taken into account by the Commission in the review that it will carry out in 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when we are constantly being told of the public’s lack of interest in European issues, and when the idea of a common Europe is becoming ever more frequently associated only with debts and dull discussions on some technical aspect or other of the way in which the European institutions are organised, the Capital of Culture project is a commendable exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who was in Lille last year when the city held the title of European Capital of Culture, or who has been in Cracow, which shared the title of Capital of Culture with eight other European cities in 2000, or indeed in many other Capitals of Culture, cannot have failed to notice the public’s enormous interest in Europe and the great enthusiasm demonstrated by the large numbers of citizens who took part in remarkable cultural events. Such occasions are an opportunity for all the critics of European integration to see the enthusiasm, joy and expectation with which the public greets outstanding cultural events inspired by the quest for common European roots.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine and lively dialogue takes place in European Capitals of Culture, and it is here that inspiration should be sought by those who are weary of their job of building a community on our continent from the Rond-Point Schuman. The fundamental value of this initiative lies in the fact that it did not come about as a result of an official proposal, and that it was not dreamt up by some Brussels bureaucrat. It was mooted in Athens 20 years ago as a spur-of-the-moment idea, and subsequently taken up by other European cities. Although there are no plans for this at present, provision should be made in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for a special and separate budget to support this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I was astonished to note that the Network of the European Cities of Culture and Cultural Months (ECCM) was the only one of several dozen organisations not to receive funding from the European Commission. This specialist organisation brings together experienced managers who are responsible for implementing the initiative in their own countries, and I would ask that this oversight be corrected. Given that the initiative has been in existence for 20 years, it is now time for the European Commission to provide significant funding for it in future, and for it to pay due regard to the experience of previous organisers. The EU should provide technical and artistic support to assist those who will be in charge of organising forthcoming celebrations of the common Europe and its Cultural Capitals over the next few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my own country of Slovenia we celebrate every 8 February as a cultural holiday, and this is also a national holiday. On that day visits to exhibitions and museums are free, and numerous cultural events take place around the holiday. Nevertheless there is no shortage of people in Slovenia, too, who claim that culture is merely something superfluous and unnecessary, since it brings in no money directly. However, during the time of the holiday at least, we are more intensively preoccupied with the importance and value of culture, and we attend events that we would not normally find the time to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely due to the preservation of its cultural heritage and language that the Slovenian nation of just two million people survived all the ravages of the world wars and the aspirations of neighbouring nations to erase us from the ethnic map of Europe. In a culturally and ethnically diverse Europe it is all the more important for us to establish bridges between us. Preserving one’s own culture and enjoying the diversity and richness of other nations must be and must remain our guiding principle, since it is culture that is the least intrusive link between nations that wish to live in peace and mutual cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European capital of culture makes it possible for us to forge such links. At the same time it offers the possibility for each host to make greater investments in cultural facilities and in projects with long-term positive effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 1999 decision needs to be adapted to take account of the situation in the new enlarged Union. It is about culture, not so much about geography or economics. We also need to prepare for Bulgarian and Romanian accession so as not to create the additional question of whether incoming countries are included in this cooperation or given special consideration.

Even before a decision is made, this process is generating a lot of cultural activity and a growing awareness that culture is important and that there is a European dimension for it. I am glad that there is a high level of understanding for the decision here. We will continue to work with the rapporteur, the committee and Parliament as a whole with regard to making further improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of cooperation should be rather broader. Culture should be seen as a relationship between peoples and nations and all their ancient traditions. As Mr Graça Moura and Mr Crowley mentioned, spiritual and architectural heritage and the human dimension should be taken into account. Cities should not be seen merely as hubs for transport: they are places for living and for culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Members for their positive responses and support. I am looking forward to working on further improvements in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
