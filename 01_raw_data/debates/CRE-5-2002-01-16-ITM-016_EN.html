In the end, it was far more complicated than I had imagined, but today we are on our way to an auspicious ending and that is what counts.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this proposal for a directive is to harmonise the maximum length of both rigid and articulated buses when undertaking transport throughout the European Union. Until now, this matter has not been regulated explicitly; there was only the guarantee that rigid buses of up to 12 metres and articulated buses of up to 18 metres could circulate freely in the European Union. At national level, for example, there are 4 different maximum lengths for rigid buses, meaning that some buses are unsuitable for EU-wide use, thereby distorting competition. The Member States wish to harmonise these maximum lengths, at least for buses used throughout the European Union, and have asked the Commission to work out a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind the House that Parliament adopted 3 amendments at first reading. In the first amendment, it proposed extending the date until which Member States may authorise buses with dimensions not complying with the requirements of the new directive to circulate on their territory from December 2009, as proposed by the Commission, to 2015, in order to allow a normal economic life for those buses. The Council proposed stretching this date even further until December 2020, a modification the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed with fully. With the second amendment, the European Parliament proposes the same length of 18.75 metres for articulated buses, as for buses with trailers. The common position also accepted this amendment so of course we have no problem there. The last amendment allows rigid buses of up to 13.5 metres to have two axles. Buses between 13.5 and 15 metres long must have three axles, in order to avoid exceeding the maximum weight per axle. This amendment too was accepted. Only the part of this amendment defining "rigid" was not accepted, but this is a merely terminological question. It should be noted that the common position adopts the Commission's proposal to use the new manoeuvrability criteria which are in the process of being adopted within the Economic Committee for Europe of the United Nations in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal and the United Kingdom, I would remind you, may ban buses from their territory which do not comply with the old, stricter manoeuvrability criteria for up to three years after the directive enters into force. Similarly, Member States are allowed to impose local restrictions on the use of extra long buses for safety or other reasons. I am referring here to Article 7 of the common position, which the committee discussed at length. This should largely meet the concerns expressed in some amendments rejected at second reading in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it is clear from all this that there is nothing left for me to do but to propose, as the Committee has done, that Plenary adopt this common position without amendment, since it strikes a reasonable balance between internal market, regulatory, safety, technical and commercial considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, it would be a simple matter for inspectorates across the EU to verify whether the relevant driver is employed correctly, that is to say in accordance with current, national social legislation rules. At the moment, such inspection is difficult to implement outside national borders due to varying regulations and documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has backed this initiative at first reading. It was noted, however, that this proposal could not be expected to be a universal remedy. After all, there are also bilateral, international and ECMT licences, by means of which drivers from outside the European Union can legally work in a certain way in the European Union. For a number of businesses, the dividing line between the legal and illegal deployment of these drivers does not seem clear enough. Consequently, this proposal only applies to drivers who are employed by EU businesses and who drive lorries from these businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Parliament was of the opinion at first reading that the proposal should be subject to a phased introduction for non-EU drivers and EU drivers on account of the administrative measures which Member States would be required to take. With this, Parliament demonstrated that it had an insight into the situation in the sector, where non-EU drivers form the key problem, at least judging from the number of complaints about these practices. This is why Parliament has opted for a two-year delay before the regulation enters into force for EU drivers. In addition, Parliament was of the opinion that the data to be included in the attestation should also comprise the driver’s licence number and social security number. In its common position, the Council has shown widespread endorsement of Parliament’s views. It recognises the issues described and deems the attestation at least to be a constructive element in solving existing distortions of competition in international road transport. Of Parliament’s amendments, the Council has only directly adopted the amendment on the inclusion of the driver’s licence number and social security number. The amendments on a phased introduction for non-EU and EU drivers have not been directly adopted by the Council. The Council does accept a phased introduction but does not yet wish to establish the ultimate date on which, based on data currently available, the proposal becomes effective for drivers from the European Union. The proposal should not enter into force for EU drivers until it transpires that this would actually add value, based on an assessment of the regulation in force at the time. In addition, the Council has given an interpretation of the inspection percentage (20%) of the number of attestations issued.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have to conclude that the positions of the Council and Parliament are not miles apart. Both recognise the nub and urgency of the problem: non-EU drivers. This is the group, therefore, that should come under this regulation as soon as possible. Both the Council and Parliament agree on this. As far as EU drivers are concerned, I should like to note that – on the basis of data available – the situation is far less urgent. The evaluation established by the Council seems to be a useful tool for bringing more data to light. However, I am of the opinion that it is very desirable to settle on an end date for this evaluation. This is why I am very impressed with Commissioner de Palacio’s written pledge to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to commission the relevant evaluation within three years. I trust that she will orally confirm this assurance during this sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I think that Parliament can be satisfied with the text that is now before us. I would therefore like to recommend that, together with the Commissioner’s pledge, it be adopted without any amendments .</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the report by Mr Grosch. I endorse the report, but it is vital that the candidates be adequately tested after each training course and that daily practice be included in continuous training. If we prescribe that it is on the basis of national standards that each driver must be trained, this will promote so-called ‘student tourism’, which is exactly what we want to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition has also correspondingly become more intense, which has necessarily also led to the tendency for safety and work conditions to lose out in many businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive now before us on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road is intended to be, in essence, a protective measure and to improve the situation of these drivers. Not only technological developments but also more stringent environmental and safety requirements seem to us to make a sufficient case for, on the one hand, improving their training and, on the other, needing to add to this through continuous training on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the many discussions we have had with the industry, we have also, however, established that shortages in the labour force must not result in this directive having a restrictive effect. A reason why I also wish to thank all the groups, who played a very constructive part in this dialogue, is that the Committee accordingly attempted to introduce proposals for amendments which were not intended to completely change the Directive, but to make it a bit more flexible. For one thing, we created a sort of bridge to the driving licence, being aware that, in many Member States, training leading to the award of a driving licence already imposes certain conditions equivalent to the training requirements we are proposing. So it seems important to us that the training should be gone through without being duplicated, once for the driving licence and again in professional training.</p>
<p class="contents">The same philosophy applied to the training objectives. Our concern was not to lay down every detail, but only the training objectives in general terms and thus to leave them in the Annex, because this makes possible the flexible use of these training objectives and leaves open the possibility of adapting them in the light of future developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Training at present varies from one country to another, and we have accordingly laid it down that countries can revise the details in consultation with the Commission. The objective is that training should be equal. This Directive is not intended to alter any training already provided by a country.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuous training appears to us to be an important issue as regards further development, and we hope that, here too, a bridge to the driving licence may be created, because we see continuous training for the driving licence as also constituting a significant element at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also opted for flexibility in the form of seven hours' continuous training, in other words, one day, rather than for larger units, in order not to impose a burden on businesses. We have not, I think, gone over the top with one day, representing 0.05% of an employee's labour input.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally also insist firmly that there should be flexibility about the training centres. If we are to speak in terms of mobility in Europe these days, the training centre is not necessarily to be tied to the business or to where the driver lives. If this certificate is to be valid right across Europe, it should also be possible to train anywhere in Europe. In this, we are also aware of the fact that this may well be an interesting and important Directive, but that, unfortunately, not all the problems have yet been solved. Mr van Dam has just mentioned the bilateral authorisations, which are still valid in Europe, leaving room for misuse in this area. We know too that certain businesses continue to avail themselves of the possibility – something I rather regret about Mr van Dam's report – that we will limit this standard driver's certificate to the countries that are not members of the EU. For there are excesses in these areas within the Fifteen Member States too. I do not want to name the firms involved, but some names in this field are well known to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that all this could form an integrated whole if, tomorrow, we were to gain a standard driver's certificate, a directive on journey times and rest periods, a card to confirm these and then also this Directive on driving licences and the training needed today. This could be readily monitored; hence our appeal for improved monitoring, not only to the Commission, but especially also to the Member States. Any Directive, no matter how good it is, can only be of value if it is regularly monitored – monitored, moreover, to an equal degree in each and every Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The level of knowledge of the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism never ceases to amaze me, in regard to technical details such as the number of axles on buses, turning circles of buses, and so on and so forth. I am grateful to them for their work. As far as the PSE Group is concerned, in relation to Mr Hatzidakis' report, we are happy with the common position and the same goes for Mr van Dam's report. We will be voting accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Grosch's report, I welcome the directive because it recognises that we now have an opportunity to improve road safety. Working conditions for drivers have direct economic but also safety implications. By proposing a training regime for professional drivers we will be enhancing the status of those drivers. It is also important to recognise that in light of enlargement these provisions will have to be incorporated into legislation by the candidate countries. I know many Member States include driver education in their basic education system, but for those that do not, this directive will make it possible for all drivers to receive proper training.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of subsidiarity was raised in committee and indeed is raised again in plenary through a number of amendments. My group believes that the compromise position that we reached in committee, with the help of our rapporteur, Mr Grosch, enables the directive to offer mere guidelines and therefore negates the need for subsidiarity. My group will therefore be voting against most amendments that advocate this principle and in support of the rapporteur's position. We will also vote in favour of Amendment No 43, which proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of this directive and vote against other amendments that try to be too prescriptive. We are, in short, agreeing with the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank all the rapporteurs for their work and congratulate them all on producing three well-balanced reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should particularly like to congratulate Mr Van Dam on the important work he has done. The St. Gothard tunnel accident made it clear that common European legislation is very necessary and urgently required so that tough action can be taken against illegally employed drivers who do not carry the necessary paperwork. However, whether attestations will be sufficient will become evident from the evaluation. I should also like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his report. This too stresses the need for prescribing uniform requirements for drivers, because this is a typically transnational profession. In the final analysis, what matters is safety and fair competition on the roads and, in this light, it is of the utmost importance for each driver to have had adequate training before they use the public roads, and for them to be able to specialise and receive continuous training, and for the requirements to be equivalent in all Member States and accession countries. This will also afford the profession more standing, which is very important, and will also make it more appealing. For the Liberals, it is essential for what has been learnt also to be tested properly by an independent body. However, a certain degree of flexibility and pragmatism will be required. The duration of the training, as proposed by the Commission, is unnecessarily long and would have an inhibiting effect. Furthermore, a proper exam will provide far more certainty that the driver has actually learnt what he thinks he has learnt. However, the flexibility which Mr Bradbourn and others would like to build in is excessive in our view. We are unable to back the majority of the amendments because they would, in fact, render the regulation superfluous and the exam ineffective, and we should thus be overshooting our target. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These reports are not only those before us but are also those on the organisation of working hours, whereby the working hours for employed, but also for self-employed, drivers have been reduced from an average of 60 to 48 hours. In this package, we have drawn on our concern for safety, the environment and efficiency to still try to get a number of proposals adopted in order to improve the whole environment of freight transport by road, as well as the role which the driver plays in this. Reference has already been made to accidents which happen on a regular basis, also involving people from third countries who do not carry the paperwork.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report by Mr Van Dam, I should like to note that we really have been in a position to implement this in a relatively short space of time, and that is why I should like to support his attempts to prevent another round of amendments so that we can roll up our sleeves at the earliest opportunity, in the knowledge that there will undoubtedly be a number of flaws which will be picked up during the evaluation which will take place within three years – at least, I assume that this promise will be confirmed shortly. I also endorse the comments by Mr Brian Simpson that the way in which subsidiarity is being used by Mr Bradbourn in his amendments is not actually the way in which we should be working at the moment. As the Group of the Greens, we shall resolutely vote against this approach. I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to rapporteur Hatzidakis and, obviously, Mr Grosch. Mr Hatzidakis, this was a technical amendment. These are the kinds of reports which we passed on to the then chairman with great pleasure, and I wish you every success in your next job in this transport environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, few political points can be scored. But even small steps are necessary in order to ensure flexible transportation. I thank those who have drafted the reports for their splendid work and, for example, Mr Grosch for his positive and constructive attitude to his colleagues’ proposals for amendments. With regard to Mr Hatzidakis's report, it is particularly satisfying that the Council is now permitting the use of old buses until the end of their economic life. Anything else would of course be a senseless waste of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as dimensions are concerned, I would like to mention the situation regarding lorries. Finland and Sweden allow lorries which are larger than normal. We allow lorries six and a half metres longer than elsewhere in the EU. These dimensions should definitely also be adopted for use throughout the entire area of the EU. If this procedure were followed, the load carried by lorries would be increased from forty tonnes to sixty tonnes. The advantages here are obvious even to the layman. Space would be saved on our congested roads, since two Finnish lorries are the equivalent of three lorries from elsewhere in Europe. Continental Europe could from time to time take a lesson from Nordic pragmatism. The combination of improved traffic flow and the economy of scale would lead to a cleaner environment. This is precisely what is announced in the Transport White Paper;<span class="italic"> merci, madame </span>Palacio Vallelersundi. Therefore I ask the Commission to respond in this matter and to consider a proposal along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that road transport is far and away the most important mode of transportation in Europe, which in addition to everything else offers door-to-door service. The railways, which, sad to say, work poorly, must of course be improved. The fact that icebreakers travel more quickly than goods trains is absurd (not that Finnish icebreakers are particularly slow!). The last thing we should do, however, is to throw a spanner in the works for road transport. The dynamism of Europe depends on a flourishing economy, and the lifeblood of this is effective road transportation. By standardising provisions we can ensure fair conditions for competition, not only between forms of transportation but also between Member States. I believe that these proposals are a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These actions will improve traffic safety, and this is an important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">A reasonably balanced common position on the maximum authorised dimensions for vehicles has been achieved, as the rapporteur Mr Hatzidakis stated. Extending the transitional period makes it possible to make sensible use of the current stock of buses until the end of their life-span. The time made available for this is now truly sufficient. Technical development offers the opportunity to use increasingly longer vehicles, while at the same time also taking safety factors into consideration. Standardising the maximum lengths of buses will also reduce distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of a standardised driver's certificate will promote fair competition in the sector and will also improve traffic safety. Applying the Regulation solely to the drivers of third countries, at least in the first phase, is justified.</p>
<p class="contents">This third report on standardising the professional training of drivers for the carriage of goods or passenger vehicles by road may both promote traffic safety and improve the status of drivers. At the same time it will also be possible to raise the prestige of the sector and to increase its attraction to young people. This, too, is an important matter. It is also worth noting that a better mode of driving will also spare the environment. The basic training requirement for drivers must not however prevent existing drivers from returning to the sector. Account is taken of this in the report. Participation in training must be as flexible as possible. The training programme must be drafted in such a way that the length of one course section should be at least seven hours. Most important, however, is to ensure that the training makes it possible to truly improve the professional competence of drivers, exactly as Mrs Sanders-ten Holte recently emphasised here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who among us does not shake his head and wonder how such a thing is possible on our roads at the beginning of the 21st century? The quality standard for road transport in the EU can and must be increased – there is no doubt about that. The driving profession, with the ever-increasing demands made upon it, must be built up and made more appealing. The safety of road transport must also be improved. It remains to be seen whether the option that the Commission is proposing here will indeed improve the situation. In my view, the directive before us will achieve no decisive added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Training is inherently to be welcomed and is advantageous to the profession, but the driving test means that every driver, even today, has to demonstrate more than just a comprehensive knowledge of the Highway Code. ‘Swept twice keeps cleaner longer’, they say back where I come from, but there is no clear and compelling logic to the way the Directive now – as I see it, unnecessarily – requires double the course content in many areas. Here is a crucial example. There is in Germany already a real training scheme for professional drivers, which takes three years, so, in comparison, the time required, referred to in the title of the Directive and, incidentally, reduced further by the Council, can only be described as basic vocational training. Nothing more can be achieved within a time limit of 140 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned added value, yet, when I consider the details of the regulations under consideration, what I perceive at several points is more of a deterioration. An eighteen-year-old is now supposed to be allowed to drive a forty-ton lorry with a hazardous load across the Alpine passes – and that after only a few hours' basic training! That cannot be what the originator had in mind. We need the profession of driver to be enhanced; that is what the Directive is meant to do. There is, though, a need for improvement as regards safety on the roads. Perhaps everything would be much better, if we had, at long last, a new tachograph. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a typical tactic, to have a heading announcing, actually very tersely, what is meant to be at issue, and then, in the directive in question, to proceed to expand on it as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already for some time now been following with a critical mind developments on European buses, because this wealth of detail was actually far from necessary at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We – and Parliament is at one on this point – are, at the end of the day, fighting for the principle of mutual recognition. We should then, if at all possible, cause the principle of mutual recognition to prevail in fact. Let there be harmonisation only where it is really, absolutely necessary. I wish at this point to commend the directive as an example of how short and precise an overall provision on European buses should be.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would really like is for this directive to abrogate all other directives on European buses, thus enabling countries and nations to have buses of a design appropriate to their needs, as, of course, a village bus in Sicily's hot climate has to look different from a bus in London's rush hour or a bus that has to cover great distances in northern Finland. This is where harmonisation is false, costing a lot of money and calling for unnecessary effort. This is where the Commission urgently needs to do some thinking about which areas require voluntary self-regulation and which need standards to be laid down. We have excellent standards committees, but only where they are absolutely necessary do we need framework directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All we need is the mutual recognition of national qualifications, possibly underpinned by a loose framework directive, to ensure minimum standards, especially with regard to third-country nationals. However, what we have is a typical piece of EU legislation: intrusive, prescriptive, vastly expensive. It is a Christmas tree on which we have hung our wish list of expensive baubles. Environmental issues are important, but they have no bearing on the ability to drive a truck.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for training on a healthy diet have already attracted widespread ridicule in the British press. Asking the British trucker to give up his sausage and eggs is like inviting the Pope to a disco – it simply makes us look absurd. But we are inviting worse than ridicule. In the UK alone these proposals are estimated by the industry to cost over EUR 200m a year in a business already under great stress. The time commitment for training required of the individual owner-operator is unsustainable and will drive hundreds out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House we constantly pay lip service to the needs of SMEs, yet again and again we ignore their concerns. We talk about the problem of unemployment, then we pass directives that destroy jobs. These proposals form part of a concerted attack by the Commission on the road haulage industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I should declare an interest: my stepson is a truck driver and he and his colleagues are aghast at these proposals. I have studied them in vain for a realistic business impact assessment. We are looking at huge costs, huge damage to the industry – especially to small businesses – and huge damage to European competitiveness. A further impediment to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives, and all for what? For benefits which at best are vague and speculative. I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report. Let us stand back for a moment and consider the huge damage we do as we create a torrent of onerous and unnecessary legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent work as rapporteur on the report on the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and on his work on achieving an agreement at the end of this process. I would like to express my satisfaction, because the report’s conclusion manages to find a reasonable balance between the internal market, regulation and safety, without forgetting technical and commercial considerations. In fact, this was the intention of the Commission when it proposed the initiative and, I would, therefore, like to thank Parliament for adopting the common position, which the Commission fully supports without amendment given that, in practical terms, it incorporates all the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and introduces other slight modifications to the Commission’s initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that I have thanked Mr Hatzidakis for his work, I would like to also thank Mr Van Dam for the work he has done and tell him here and now that the Commission intends to draw up an evaluation report over three years, as soon as the Regulation enters into force. I hope that, with this, Parliament will be able to vote on the basis of the Council common position and bring the matter to a conclusion, which will allow us to embark upon a more focused battle for employment and to regulate the situation of third country nationals employed as drivers by EU transport companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer to the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road. I would like to thank Mr Grosch, who has drawn up the last report on road transport that we are debating today and say that the report and its explanatory statement show that the European Parliament shares the point of view of the European Commission on the importance of this proposal, even though it is a technical proposal. The measures proposed allow for a complete package to be introduced in the area of training and assessment of bus and truck drivers to establish minimum requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Langenhagen, this is not an obligation to reduce the amount of professional training given in particular countries, it simply seeks to establish minimum requirements that must be met in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, therefore, no need to alter the three-year requirement currently in force in Germany. In fact, the opposite is true, given that this is in excess of the minimum stated in the Directive. What is really needed is for all German drivers, not just the minimum number, as is the case today, to take up and complete this training. The objectives are to raise the quality of professional drivers and standards in road transport in general and to guarantee positive results in terms of road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, we can accept the majority of the amendments, making a few alterations here and there, but some of them, on the other hand, we are bound to reject. For example, Amendments Nos 25 to 41, which aim to make the initiative the sole responsibility of the Member States. We should not forget that only 5% of Community bus and goods vehicle drivers currently benefit from professional training. Just 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is, therefore, essential in order to improve this situation, and only Community legislation to make it mandatory can fulfil this objective. These amendments, however, would lead to reduced safety standards and a clear distortion of competition. In particular, with regard to Amendment No 37, we will incorporate some of Mr Bradbourn’s concerns into the modified Commission proposal, in order to thus leave a wider margin for the principle of subsidiarity, because we feel that on some of the issues he has raised, he is right.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the Commission is able to accept the principle of parallel training with the aim of obtaining both a driving licence and a certificate of professional competence, we would prefer to avoid any kind of duplication, and this why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 16, 17 and 18. We cannot accept No 5 either, because imposing basic training on drivers who already work in this profession but do not have three years previous experience could cause difficulties in the sector, which is currently suffering from serious problems due to a lack of drivers. However, in the spirit of compromise we could accept Amendment No 27. With regard to Amendment No 10, which relates to the inclusion of training within working hours, the Commission considers that this is an issue that both sides of industry should agree upon, and, therefore, cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has problems with Amendment No 13, which refers to the place of training. We feel that there could be a certain degree of flexibility in continuous short-term training, and that it should be able to take place both in the Member State in which a driver is normally<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>resident and in the country in which he or she is contracted to work, but not in other areas, given that there are similar accepted requirements with regard to driving licences and the driver card.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 introduces an international transport option based mainly on the understanding of languages. This is not the aim of this proposal and, therefore, cannot be accepted and we reject it. The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 2, 22 and 23 either, because they go beyond the scope of the current Directive. Finally, we believe that Amendments Nos 42, 44 and 45, which lay down the duration of training in the body of the text rather than in the Annex, cannot be accepted either.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by thanking the three rapporteurs for their work. I would also like to thank Parliament, and there are no surprises here, for two of their proposals, specifically the proposal on maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and the proposal establishing a driver attestation and I hope that these will be approved so that we can move ahead as soon as possible with their implementation. I hope that in later stages of proceedings we will be able to reach agreement on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road, which we also consider to be a vitally important factor in improving road safety and in preventing market distortions, specifically in the transport market within the European Union. I hope this happens because, as I have already said, many of the amendments tabled are going to be accepted and some of those that mention the suitability of leaving a wider margin for subsidiarity will be incorporated into the amended proposal that we will be presenting at an appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
