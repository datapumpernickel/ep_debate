Since the last Financial Perspectives, the EU has undertaken the biggest enlargement in its history and has become even more integrated with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and the signing of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last seven years, the world has become more globalised and societies have become more complex and diversified. Attitudes, customs, behaviour and even values have changed. The Financial Perspectives must therefore be adaptable to the current political context and to the new realities of the world in which we live. With the decision on the Financial Perspectives, we have a unique opportunity to show that we have a more ambitious vision for Europe, a winning vision, which I think is shared by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore prevent, at all costs, any lowering of the objectives of the Financial Perspectives or any simple act of budgetary consolidation, which some people would appear to want. In this context, I should like to ask Mrs Grybauskaitė kindly to comment on the three essential prerequisites on which, to my mind, the Financial Perspectives ought to be based.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is credibility. The political priorities of stepping up the competitiveness of both the economy and European cohesion must go hand in hand. Secondly, there must be a clear break from previous practices, by which I mean we need to set about reforming the EU’s own resources. Thirdly, imaginative solutions must be created, such as ensuring that funds earmarked in the EU’s budgets also act as a tool for mobilising other financial sector resources, be they from the public or private sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be possible for it to be adopted by everyone, both new and old Member States. This also applies to states that are quite well off. In northern Europe, onerous special conditions apply that have not disappeared. It cannot be fair to allow permanently disadvantaged areas, for example those with cold climates and long distances, to pay, as it were, for the fact that, statistically, they appear to be rich.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an expectation that certain projects not directly linked to the EU budget are to be turned into a reality. In the Baltic region, for example, there is universal support for improving water quality in the Baltic. This means, among other things, that it needs to be possible for all waste water, including that from Saint Petersburg, to be cleaned. The research priorities must support development of whole regions that have lived apart for historical reasons, such as the Baltic region and Central Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would state that there are high expectations of greater clarity in the EU’s foreign policy. We face challenges in Ukraine, Caucasus, Belarus and perhaps also Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a great pity that the Council is not present now to listen to our debate on the problems we face with the Financial Perspective, for, speaking as a regional politician – and as one who works in this House’s Committee on Regional Development – it is clear to me that we need the security to plan ahead. That means that we need agreement, and need it very soon, as 2005 is the final deadline if the planning stage is not to prove insufficient for the local authorities. What that also means is that the loss is borne by the local stakeholders who want to get involved in planning, because the planning rules will be implemented at this level far too late.</p>
<p class="contents">I also endorse what the Commissioner said about it making sense, in this first year with ten new Member States, to extend the period to seven years, in order to have a long planning stage where the Structural Funds are concerned. That makes sense in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to stress that the Structural Funds must not be turned into a piggy bank, for cohesion is at the heart of the European Union. In the country I know best, this throws up contradictions when politicians appeal to the masses with speeches about the 1% issue, only then to go to Brussels and ask for money to sort out the structural problems in their region.</p>

We have the advantage of a fixed term, we ought to use that for future financial perspective periods.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agreed this afternoon with Mr van den Berg when he said that we must do something in the nation-states to tighten up on accountability. That leads me on to our philosophy in the British Conservative group, which is that we should try to do what we can in Europe and do it effectively and efficiently. If that means doing less, then let us do it better. Too often we try to increase the powers in Europe and increase our coverage of all sorts of items. That does not just cost money, it leads to further dilution of concentration, of accountability, and that is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I wish to raise is about own resources. We need to consider the method of own resources. We have a perfectly acceptable method that works quite well and we should not make fundamental changes to it. I would not ever like to see the imposition of a European Union tax, which has been thought about for the period from 2013 onwards. That would be a retrograde step. We need to have a Council of Ministers that is all-powerful in my book, even speaking as an MEP. Basically it pays the bills, and that is fine by me, provided we can control what we are doing and provide proper accountability in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial because the European Union must rise to formidable challenges: bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion, achieving the aim of cohesion, the symbol of our policy of solidarity, without forgetting the less favoured regions of the old Union of 15, meeting commitments under the common agricultural policy and Natura 2000 and, above all, achieving the Lisbon objectives in the realms of competitiveness, research, employment, training, environmental policy and public health while giving due consideration to the ageing of our population. This last point has not been addressed this afternoon, even though an ageing population clearly has economic and social implications for our future.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced by these challenges and by the explosive growth in Chinese competition, how does the Commission intend to position itself? At a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the gates of Europe once again, can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 1990s, even though the European Union has subsequently taken on many new Member States and been accorded wider powers under a series of new treaties?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grybauskaitė, we are not reassured. Questions need to be asked about the Commission’s desire to make tangible proposals. Arm yourself with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one-per-centers, to bring home to them, as Mr Barroso said, that more Europe cannot be achieved without more money. Even allowing for the agreement on the CAP, we already know that it will be impossible to fund the Union’s regional policy between now and 2013 if we adhere to the one-per-cent ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is on the move; it has been enlarged, it is ambitious, but are you sure, Mrs Grybauskaitė, that you have the means to fulfil its ambition? What we are asking you to do is tell us what resources are needed to finance our objectives. And you know that they will have to be increased. Be prepared, Commissioner, to defend the key positions vigorously. You must be aware that this would be a bad time to disappoint not only Parliament, but all the people of Europe too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our debate this morning on the 2005 Budget, a very large number of speakers appealed to the Council to take the Budget more seriously. If, though, we aim to achieve an agreement with the Council at a time when we are already talking in terms of a motion on Budget shortfall, then the figures we have agreed are not credible, and many already suspect that we may well not be able to manage on them. Reading the media over the past few days on the subject of the Financial Perspective, I begin to fear the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fear a similar lack of seriousness when it comes to the debate on Turkey and other current issues, and I ask you, Commissioner, not to be a spectator, but to be more politically pro-active.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budget and the Financial Perspective are work programmes in the form of figures, and today we have started to discuss the policy programme for the next five years. What we demand is greater competitiveness; Lisbon and Barcelona are the top priorities and must be implemented just as much as an enhanced role in the world for young people, the fight against terrorism, enlargement through the addition of Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania, a new neighbourhood policy and improved information and communications policies.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like you to tell us is whether all the things we have been debating today with regard to additional responsibilities and measures are actually contained in the old Commission’s proposal, or whether the new Commission has to put its stamp upon it and demand political projects? Up to now, it has only been whispered behind the scenes that there are constant discussions about the upper limit. Let us put a stop to playing games with numbers and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost, and then we will be able to talk about own resources and the allocation of tasks and about who has to do what. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I welcome the fact that nearly all the honourable Members who have spoken considered that the European Union budget should be commensurate with the ambitions tabled from time to time by both the Commission and Parliament, because it is a fact that policy without money is not possible. What I find particularly negative is the fact that the size of the budget is being discussed and there are tendencies to make cutbacks at a time when, even if the Commission proposal were accepted, this would be the equivalent of the European Union's spending a total of 2.5% of all annual public expenditure in Europe, because that is what we are talking about at a time when we have ambitions, as I said, for important and serious things.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like a clarification on the part of the Commissioner as to what is going to happen in connection with the future of the Structural Funds if no decision is taken by the end of this year, because there is a multiannual aspect to Structural Fund policies, there is the problem of creating what may be a legal lacuna, which will prevent the programmes from starting on 1 January 2007. How could this be addressed, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue on which I wish to comment concerns the cost of enlargement, given that enlargement comes at a price which we have to pay, because it is a major historic choice of the European Union; on the other hand, however, this price needs to be distributed fairly. I know that, from a technical point of view, this issue does not come under the issue we are discussing now, but it is tangential to the general issue and I should like the Commissioner to tell me if the Commission has at its disposal studies which show how the cost of enlargement will ultimately be distributed. I refer to the question of own resources, Commissioner, but I think that these issues are directly connected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all the issues under consideration are being discussed. This may have been the case in the past, but it has come as a surprise to some of the new entrants to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I would like to make is that the proposal to limit the budget to 1% is not inspired by the wish to economise, nor does it stem from a desire to rationalise expenditure. It is the consequence of the plan to change the allocation of financial resources and the view that the latter can be utilised more effectively in national policies. What we are therefore witnessing is a reduction of the scope of Community policies. This does not come as a surprise to advocates of a coordinating Union, but it is cause for alarm amongst advocates of a strong Union. Restricting income and expenditure impacts directly on all countries, because it requires changes to the structure of financing cohesion policy and restricting its scope. Naturally, the weakest countries are the most affected, when they ought to be the main beneficiaries of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that cohesion policy is being reinterpreted before our very eyes. This policy is becoming increasingly detached from its base, namely the principle of sharing the problems of under-development in the spirit of solidarity, and responding jointly also to the pronounced inequalities which are the inevitable consequence of economic integration. It is therefore essential to support the efforts made in the Council of the European Union by those governments radically opposed to amendment of the relevant provisions and deletion of the principle of supporting the less-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An example from the sporting world comes to mind. Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a situation in which a number of players are recruited to join a football team. They are eager to play, prepared to undergo a demanding training period, and full of fighting spirit and the desire to win. Now imagine that when they make it onto the football pitch they are informed that the rules have changed and that they will be required to play rugby instead. I am sure you will understand that in such a case the players would be unpleasantly surprised and taken aback. It is to be hoped that the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will act consistently to ensure that the rules remain unchanged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am emphasising this as most of the honourable Members who have taken the floor in this debate hail from the old Fifteen, and their views on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 are very much at variance with those held by the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The first problem I would like to highlight is the size of the budget for the period in question. The six so-called net contributors argue for 1% of GDP, whereas the Prodi Commission proposed 1.14% of GDP. According to estimates, in absolute terms this amounts to a difference of about EUR 180 billion, which means around EUR 25 billion less for each year of this Financial Perspective. This is an enormous sum from the point of view of the new Member States. It is a sum that is absolutely essential to reduce the differences in development between old and new Member States, and to ensure that the division into a first and second class Europe does not become permanently entrenched.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem I should like to refer to concerns the resources for Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. I refer in particular to their allocation to regions in the old Union affected by the ‘statistical effect’. The Commission is showing remarkable generosity towards these regions. There are plans to allocate no less than EUR 194 billion to them over these next seven years, but only EUR 181 billion to regions in the new Union. It should be borne in mind that this period will see the accession of at least two new Member States, and that the whole of the territory of the 12 new countries is eligible for support.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem I wish to mention concerns limiting resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to 4% of the GDP of the Member State in question. For the ten new Member States this means an annual total of less than EUR 20 billion. I believe it would be appropriate to raise the threshold to at least 5% of the GDP of the Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope the Commissioner will take the three concerns I mentioned into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the new financial framework should be driven by the political priorities of the enlarged Union and the principle of solidarity among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the own-resources ceiling should be established at a level that would assure the successful integration of the new Member States in the Union and take account of commitments entered into during the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it is my firm belief that we, the European Parliament, have to support high allocations for the Lisbon strategy measures from the Commission's budget. A clear mechanism securing a certain share of funds for each Member State should be designed for funding this priority. I should also like to point out that the funding of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should not be at the expense of EU cohesion policy. The assistance planned for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should add to, rather than replace, the assistance under the cohesion policy, as competitiveness and cohesion are mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, from the point of view of less-developed economies in the EU, the level of financial assistance should be proportional to countries' current economic level of development. In any case the assistance rate per capita should not be higher in the more prosperous Member States than in the less-developed ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, we should also consider that the limitation of structural assistance through the capping rule, if it is applied in the next programming period, could, in some cases, slow down the social and economic convergence of the least-developed Member States, by directing cohesion policy resources to more developed Member States and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission rightly pointed out that an enlarged EU requires more money. It is impossible to overcome the challenges of an enlarged and ever-enlarging Europe with less money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is particularly true in the case of cohesion policy and regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> In the past, in fact, regional policy has been extremely effective. The disparities in Europe have levelled out to a large extent, and, in the light of new key initiatives, especially the Lisbon agenda, this policy should certainly be continued. This can only be done, however, if this Parliament, in consultation with the Commission and the Council, lays down the new regulations in good time. In concrete terms, this means that by the middle of next year, mid-2005, we should be able to take a decision on this, failing which we will have a repeat of what happened in 1999 when the debates were too lengthy and implementation had to be cut short.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon agenda requires perseverance on the part of the national governments and of those involved in the regions. This means that we must be ready in time, and, from that point of view, carrying the whole thing over to the second half of 2006, under the British Presidency, would be detrimental to the policy. In short, I should like to emphasise the importance of regional policy in the context of the Lisbon objectives, innovation, promotion of competition and the new second budget objective, partly because this can promote cooperation in regions and cooperation between partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, turning to the financial perspectives, that the 1% does, of course, make them impossible. Another factor that plays a role in this is that we have learned that implementation was closer to the people in a decentralised setting in conjunction with provinces, regions, cities, social partners in the regions in Europe, and greater involvement was the result. If 1% were to culminate in a renationalisation of policy, we would miss the European added value, and I would find that very regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quantitatively, what is being proposed is actually an average of 1.09% of Community GNI, which is less than Agenda 2000 (1.10%) and previous benchmarks; qualitatively, the priorities are ‘competitiveness’, ‘entrepreneurial spirit’ and ‘security and defence’ at the expense of development, cooperation and cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">One might ask in this debate whether Barroso reinforces and exacerbates Prodi, given that statements from Commissioners pave the way towards negotiating, or renegotiating, below the already inadequate package, in line with the signatories of the ‘Letter of the six’, who intend to impose a ceiling of 1% of Community GNI on the budget, something to which we have always been opposed. We therefore wish to make it clear that we reject the Financial Perspectives, of which the average annual spending falls between the Commission’s proposal and the ceiling of the ‘Letter of the six’, which I mentioned earlier, and is moving ever closer to that ceiling. Lastly, we support the idea of retaining the seven-year financial framework, given that, even in this area, the tendency is to ‘negotiate’ downwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
