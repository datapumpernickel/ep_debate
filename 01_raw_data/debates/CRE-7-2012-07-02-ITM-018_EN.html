Tachographs play a crucial role in checking compliance by professional road transport drivers with the rules on driving times and rest periods. Therefore, they contribute to improving road safety, drivers’ working conditions and fair competition between road transport companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal for a regulation provides for a series of technical measures, including improved tachograph functions, wireless communications for reducing roadside checks and the establishment of a harmonised interface with other Intelligent Transport Systems applications, as well as a series of non-technical measures including more trustworthy workshops, making fraud with driver cards more difficult, better training of control officers, a minimum degree of harmonisation of sanctions and modernised rules concerning use.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the connection of the tachograph to a global navigation satellite system, Parliament recommends that only those satellite positioning service connections should be used that exploit a positioning service free of charge, and that only the location data strictly needed to cross-check the information recorded by the tachograph by control authorities shall be automatically and compulsorily recorded.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to merging the functionalities of driver cards with driving licences, Parliament calls on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on the feasibility and merits of merging all of the cards used by professional drivers, in particular, the driver card with the driver licence, within 24 months of the adoption of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to examine the technical solutions available, card compatibility problems and data protection-related issues prior to recommending merging these cards’ functionalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Transport and Tourism emphasises that, in the interest of a clear, effective, proportionate and uniform implementation of social security rules in road transport, it is essential that the Member States’ authorities apply the rules in a uniform manner. To ensure compliance with social legislation and the proper use of the tachograph, manual setting by the driver of the activity performed is vital. Via Amendment 21, the TRAN Committee suggests to use for the purposes of this regulation the definition of the ‘daily working period’ provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-394/92. The TRAN Committee proposes that by 2020, all vehicles which are not exempted from the application of this regulation be fitted with a smart tachograph in order to improve road safety and social conditions for professional drivers. At the same time, Parliament considers it vital for the Member States to equip their control authorities with remote early detection equipment and train their control officers accordingly. Under no circumstances shall remote control communication lead to automatic fines or penalties for the driver or undertaking. As regards workshops, the Member States shall adopt measures to prevent conflicts of interests between fitters or workshops and road transport undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRAN Committee calls for unannounced technical audits to cover at least 20% of the approved workshops per year. At the same time, in order to reduce bureaucracy, the driver card shall be issued at the request of the driver by the competent authority within 15 days of the request being received by the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, Commissioner, that this regulation is seen as a unique opportunity to amend Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on social legislation, which is why we have tabled many amendments in this respect. I personally do not support them because I believe the regulation on digital tachographs is not the right opportunity to amend Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. However, we have also tabled a few amendments regarding certain exceptions that may bring about a certain degree of flexibility. I await fellow Members’ speeches with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Siim Kallas, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, tachographs play an important dual role for road transport: a social and a safety role. They make sure that the rules on driving time and rest periods are properly enforced. This is vital since the rules address the fatigue of drivers, which is one of the main causes of accidents involving heavy-duty vehicles. Tachographs also help ensure that the rules cannot be abused, resulting in distortion of competition between road transport operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Driving-time rules are now observed better since digital tachographs were introduced in 2006. Operators also have less paperwork than they did with the analogue tachograph, but reports indicate that levels of fraud and the administrative costs of using tachographs are still high. Last year, the Commission proposed ways to tackle these two problems. This would be done by introducing a new ‘smart tachograph’ using satellite navigation and radio communication functions, accompanied by better rules on inspections, workshops, training of enforcement officers and sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that the report from the Committee on Transport and Tourism prepared by Ms Ţicău supports and reinforces the Commission proposal. The Commission welcomes more than half of the 120 amendments adopted by the Transport Committee, as they clarify or strengthen its original proposal. They include, for instance, the amendments to strengthen the sanctions regime, to improve training of enforcers and to clarify the rules on the TACHOnet IT system and on the liability of employers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept, in principle, another quarter of the amendments. The most important of these are on the merger of driver cards with the driving licence, asking for a more detailed analysis before the implementation of such a merger; and, secondly, on moving definitions from the current annex into the main body of the legislation. I would, however, caution against applying full codecision to non-essential elements which may need regular updates, and requiring Member States to equip all their control authorities with the devices needed to read the information transmitted by the new radio communication function of the smart tachograph. This is good but costly, and I would recommend a step-by-step approach.</p>
<p class="contents">There remain 13 amendments that are of concern to the Commission. The most important are the amendments numbered 116 to 120, which would result in changes to the existing social rules and legislation on driving times – Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. These amendments would create a derogation for craftsmen driving within a radius of 150 km of their base. This is a substantial increase from the 100 km set down in the Commission’s proposal and it would negatively affect road safety. In practice, it would encourage many drivers to drive six hours or more on a daily basis without any control on their driving time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has worked tirelessly on this report and she has done her utmost to ensure that the shadow rapporteurs were kept abreast of all the latest developments, and to get compromises between the viewpoints from the different groups in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tachographs and to ensure that professional drivers respect the rules on driving hours and rest periods – something which we clearly need to look at in the EU. The Commission proposed, on 19 July 2011, to revise the tachograph legislation to make fraud more difficult and to reduce the administrative burden. According to the Commission, this is expected to save companies EUR 515 million per annum. Ms Ţicău has taken a basic proposal from the Commission and has improved on it immeasurably.</p>
<p class="contents">We badly need technical updating, notably to preserve the security level of the digital tachograph. It will be necessary, therefore, to upgrade the security mechanisms to preserve the current level of security and to avoid fraud and tampering with the data recorded by tachographs. These changes will require a migration strategy in order to ensure compatibility between the existing cards and the vehicle units in operation and those to be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Nine percent of the control vehicles are found to be breaching the social rules. Roughly one quarter of them are found to be breaching the Tachograph Regulation in particular. On average, at any one time, around 45 000 vehicles are in breach of the EU tachograph rules. Failure to respect the minimum breaks and rest periods, and the maximum driving times, can lead to more fatigued drivers and a potential road safety risk. We need to look at harmonisation of the training of control officers; we need to provide control officers with adequate and type-approved software; and we need a binding categorisation of very serious infringements of the Tachograph Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those social regulations are badly needed precisely in order to ensure that road safety is guaranteed, but also to achieve a level playing field – fair competition between businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve that, more monitoring is needed. The technology will help. It is evolving very quickly, and the new digital tachograph that we are currently aiming to define in the legislation will make remote monitoring possible, which, clearly, will mean that it will be possible to carry out much more monitoring than at present. At the moment, a lorry has to pull over before a check can be made. This alone will represent amazing progress.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, also other aspects that the rapporteur mentioned in her report that we also need to support. First of all, we need to open the debate on the scope of application. We want to evolve to a situation where all professional drivers are monitored, and the proposal to now move from 3.5 to 2.8 tonnes is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other side of the coin is the idea that we need to be more flexible when it comes to exceptions. I agree that plumbers and electricians need not be monitored. That should be clearly laid down, and the 100 km limit seems to me to be very sensible. I will make that my last point.

I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Ţicău, who was very committed in her negotiations with us shadow rapporteurs. We also really are in agreement about major points – the fact that this is about adapting practically everything, the fact that a technological innovation facilitates an improvement in control checks, which also need to be tightened up, as well as greater requirements for transparency in relation to what can now be installed, what we can check. I am thus in agreement with much of what has been put forward. There is just one area with which I do not agree, and I would like to concentrate on that area now.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start off in something of a general way. In the Europe 2020 strategy, we constantly stress the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many of these companies, and they create the jobs and the training places. In 2009, a proposal for cutting red tape specifically for these small and medium-sized enterprises was awarded a prize here. Under the proposal, there were to be options for derogations in respect of tachographs for the Member States, whereby a tradesperson who, for example, drives a 3.5-tonne vehicle himself/herself, requires no tachograph if he or she is located only 50 kilometres from his/her place of work. That should now be extended to 150 kilometres. This proposal was awarded a prize. There was actually a great deal of agreement here – albeit not with everyone – that it was a good thing to move in this direction, that this really would mean a cut in red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, the Commission has only proposed 100 kilometres, unfortunately. In committee, we initially amended that to 150 kilometres with a narrow majority. We had a majority for 150 kilometres, for exactly that proposal. That now hangs in the balance. We have now provided on a general basis that the rules should only apply once over the 100 kilometres line – and rightly so – but, at the same time, the weight limit is to be reduced to 2.8 tonnes. The current situation in Germany is that, while the regulations do specify 2.8-tonne vehicles, there are so many derogations provided that the likes of small-scale painters and electricians are not subject to the regulations at all.</p>
<p class="contents">That would change under these proposals. Because of that, I believe that we must vote against Amendment 134 and in favour of Amendment 129, which I proposed. In that way, we will be moving in the direction of cutting red tape and really doing something for small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The digital tachograph involves a certain degree of innovation, it brings with it new problems, but also old ones. The new problems come in the shape of new opportunities to manipulate the device, which we need to tackle from a technical point of view. The old problems are the ones that we can already observe in various Member States in connection with inspection or a lack thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules that we are now putting in place must pay considerable attention, in my view, to the following issues. First of all, a rest period must not automatically be commenced every time that no journey is recorded. This is because many drivers have to load and unload, and that is, of course, also to be regarded as working time. The second problem is that the records of speed have been removed from the dossier. I think that is a mistake, as here, too, there are major risks of accidents. We also want weight sensors and we want an anonymous fraud-reporting hotline that can be followed up. I will be tabling a motion for animal transport checks to be incorporated into the regulation. I think this is important, as it also has to be a key part of our legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Changes in technology have seen us move from analogue to digital, and now we have a report that really asks the question: how far can we take this?</p>
<p class="contents">It is often said here in Parliament that because we have technical capability, we need to do something with it. I disagree. Just because we can do something does not mean that we must. There is a suggestion that we merge driving licences with tachograph records. I do not agree. The two are not the same. One is private, one is professional. Like the limiting of a company’s liability, there must be protection for the individual acting in a private capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the subject of ‘Big Brother’s eye in the sky’ and satellite tracking of vehicles, this makes me very uncomfortable. If equal enforcement across Europe is our main concern, then that should be the focus, not creating a new way of tracking people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to tackle what I regard as the elephant in the room: namely, the question of money. How are we to pay for this? Is it necessary at this time? Do you want to force struggling businesses to pay for it?</p>

This is a technically difficult dossier. I would have liked a little more time for the debate and for the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The tachograph simply lacks the driving and rest periods that apply to lorry drivers. For me, therefore, it was a top, significant priority to stipulate to whom this is to apply. It strikes me that leaving it up to the Member States to decide what trades are excluded under what conditions was not the best solution. I come from a border region. This regulation will mean that a roofer driving along will have to have a tachograph in one Member State, will not need one a kilometre or two further down the road, and then will need one again a few kilometres further still. Someone who drives 150 kilometres in order to carry out his or her work, and who has a tachograph, will not be able to drive home in the evening. That is why I take the view that European legislation needs to make allowance for people’s everyday lives. This regulation is intended to apply to professional drivers – everyone who is not a professional driver is to be excluded from its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">My second issue relates to deadlines. We currently have two models of tachographs, and are now proposing a third. I have therefore proposed that we should first of all set a deadline by which there will be only one model in use and that the Commission could then, where appropriate, adapt the deadlines for a second model. The past has often shown that we sometimes set deadlines too tight when waiting for technology. It should be possible to solve this a little more simply.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the issue of the international dimension. I know that we are dealing with social conditions, working conditions. What do the citizens expect of our legislation, however? They do not expect us to say that now is not the time to change anything. Where – as in the region where I live – people spend nights and weekends in their lorries for weeks at a time and only then go home, and where these people are hired because they only receive around a third of the wages normally received in the region in question, that is not the Single European Transport Area that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is better quality, better pay and better conditions. I believe that now is the time to change this, even if it was not the aim of this directive to address this issue.</p>

It seems to me that that is already not the case at present. Let us take the example of a master roofer, as a non-professional driver, who drives his materials himself and has a 2.8-tonne vehicle. That is a light goods vehicle, and many people have those, and let us then imagine that he drives over 100 kilometres once every three years, namely 103 kilometres one way, and so actually has to fit a digital tachograph. Does that sound proportionate to you? Do you, moreover, believe that safety would be jeopardised if that were not the case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are well aware that some businessmen have organised their fleets in such a way that they are happiest to use those professional drivers for their lorries who do not need a tachograph. If we are talking about the safety of professional drivers, I therefore have no issue with the 2.8 tonnes. If, however, we are talking about avoiding chicanery for tradespeople, then you could also support my amendment, through which we simply completely eliminate this. I would prefer not to have any kilometre limits at all, but that will come in a later phase.

<p class="contents">I understand that the majority, if not all of us, have the desire and are doing whatever we can to support our small and medium-sized enterprises. We know, however, that at European level, particularly when it comes to road safety, we do not normally tend to counterbalance the tremendous costs involved with accidents, including those involving carpenters and plumbers who have 2.8-tonne vans.

<p class="contents">However, if we really want to do something for road safety in road freight transport, we need to come up with a harmonised, article-by-article interpretation of the rules on driving times and rest periods.

<p class="contents">Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism rightly rejected the proposal to merge driver card and driving licence.

It is relatively difficult to embody heterogeneous and specific transport activities within one regulatory framework, and it is therefore natural that in some cases, account must be taken of the specific conditions of driving work.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this might be the transportation of fresh cement in the construction industry, which has to be used on the building site within 60 to 90 minutes of being produced in a cement plant. At the same time, the driver transporting the cement spends only a short time behind the wheel of the cement mixer lorry. In my own country, fresh cement is, on average, transported for just 12 to 15 km. Most of the working time of the driver is thus spent either waiting for the cement to be loaded in the plant or unloaded at the building. If a driver had to apply the regulated 45-minute break when concreting, it would definitely result in a deterioration in the quality of the cement mixture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to request your support for Amendment 120 to the report, which will allow us to create the necessary conditions for the smooth performance of drivers’ work in the specific area of transporting construction materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amendment 136 seeks to broaden the reach of the legislation by altering the weight threshold for vehicles subject to regulation, in some cases, bringing it down to one-and-a-half tonnes. This brings millions of vans into the remit without any recourse to an impact assessment. It would bankrupt small businesses up and down the UK which are reliant upon such vehicles and do not have the resources to accommodate such a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Amendment 134 alters the weight limit down to 2.8 tonnes. Whilst companies in Germany operate under such limits, the UK does not. It broadens the scope of the legislation enormously, again without adequate justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Many representatives of the UK freight and haulage industry strongly oppose plans to prevent operators carrying out their own tachograph calibration. It is right that this amendment be lifted, and I hope that it stays out of future proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s proposals establish far-reaching surveillance that goes beyond anything anticipated or justified.

For a dossier as difficult as this one, which is concerned with specific and technical details that have already been mentioned, it is absolutely necessary to allow us more time and vote only once that time has been spent. Our decisions will have very tangible effects on the day-to-day working lives of many lorry drivers. First of all, it is about who needs a tachograph, for which lorries, for what distances, derogations are envisaged, what exactly will be monitored, driving and rest periods, speed, weight and, last but not least, how all these data are to be recorded and monitored. So far, so good, and I can fully support this.</p>
<p class="contents">I did notice, however, that there was a failure for us to get involved with the social dimension, in order to prevent social dumping, unfair competition on the roads and, not least, risks to road safety. Already, before any decision is made about digital tachographs, lists of tricks to circumvent and manipulate these devices are circulating. The competition in the road haulage sector is relentless, particularly under heavy pressure from third countries. Unfortunately, we have, in the meantime, reached a point where the winner at the end of the day is not the party that sticks to the rules, but the one that is best at getting around them.</p>

In these circumstances, the regulation should be revised in order to reduce the possibility of fraud.</p>

<p class="contents">The tragic events of last weekend unfortunately provide the saddest possible example of this. On a Croatian motorway close to the town of Karlovac, a Czech coach carrying 51 passengers crashed. One version of the investigation mentions a failure to stick to the minimum rest period on the part of the coach driver, who died along with seven passengers, while others were injured.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it essential to establish genuinely strict rules, particularly for passenger-carrying vehicles. Properly functioning recording equipment, giving an early warning of a breach of the rules, is an important element in boosting passenger safety on the roads. In summary, it is passengers who are directly threatened by the risky behaviour of drivers, and it is they who have an absolute right to safety during transportation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of my constituents was recently fined GBP 600 for exceeding his allotted time by 15 minutes in an effort to get home that night. There is a need for convergence of these laws only in the case of vehicles that leave the countries from which they operate. It should not apply to those that remain within their own countries.

I believe that in this area, there are, however, three things that are more important than anything else: the first is the uniformity of rules. I, like other fellow Members, think that a system of derogations could be dangerous because it would gradually erode the basic rule and would create many different situations that would fuel improper competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns working time and rest time: these are fundamental requirements in a person’s life, giving rise to respect for, and recognition of, important rights. In this case, however, rest time in particular has an additional value: if it is not adequate, if it is not applied correctly, there is a danger that safety will be severely jeopardised, thereby creating a significant problem for users too, or, put more simply, for people on the roads at that time. This is why I believe that we should pay the necessary attention to this and not underestimate any of its aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tachograph has proven to be a useful instrument to increase road safety, and it has really worked well. Now we need to adapt the rules in line with new technology and obtained experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonised enforcement is extremely important; but I think that there is increasing cooperation between Member States. Also we, the Commission, try to follow and push these practices in the right direction to have more harmonised enforcement. This is in the hands of the Member States, but this is an important issue on which I share the concerns expressed about harmonised enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards costs: our impact assessment shows that there will be practically no additional costs, and it is hoped that there will be no additional burden for businesses. It is just a development of new technology which is, in many cases, more convenient and can be better used. I would also like to emphasise that this proposal already extends the exemption for the use of tachographs from 50 km to 100 km. That is quite an extension. It also reduces the costs and the administrative burden for the business as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If we go further and extend this extension to 150 km, it can pose some serious problems concerning the overall social <span class="italic">acquis </span>in road transport and also have other potentially important consequences. Extensions have already increased from 50 km to 100 km. This increase was not emphasised today, but I think it is quite a reasonable proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank once again the shadow rapporteurs and reassure them of our further cooperation during the following stages as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few clarifications: our objective is to increase road safety and we have to mention that the cost of road accidents accounts for at least 1% of EU GDP. I have also introduced into the text of the regulation certain items contained in the annexes, which I have considered important in order for the Commission not to be given <span class="italic">carte blanche,</span> and amend by delegated acts only the non-essential and very technical elements of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have reinforced the provisions on data protection and I would like to mention for the benefit of my fellow Members who were afraid of Big Brother that the tachograph will record the start and end position of the driver’s working period and of each transport operation, that is to say, not at any time. I would also like to point out that I support the lowering of the laden mass of vehicles subject to this regulation to 2.8 tonnes and the applicability of this regulation exclusively to professional drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards penalties, I agree that it is of the utmost importance for us to be able to include in the legislation of the Member States, in the category of extremely severe penalties and breaches, the provisions and cases that are extremely serious in terms of their consequences on road safety. I do not support exceptions applicable to the whole construction sector and I agree with the example of concrete presented by our fellow Members. However, I believe the construction sector should not benefit, in general, from overly broad exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that I support the introduction of the weight sensor, which I consider important. Moreover, I should stress that speed will be recorded by the digital tachograph, but will not be transmitted by the remote communication system, because it will be checked manually when the vehicle is stopped in traffic, and control shall be performed manually as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank once again the shadow rapporteurs and reassure them of our further cooperation during the next stages in the adoption of this legislative dossier. I would like to thank all the speakers and, once again, the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, the installation and use of a tachograph, if used correctly, can be an excellent tool to improve road safety and the working conditions of hauliers, while at the same time satisfying their legitimate needs for privacy. To protect drivers, more stringent rules on driving times and rest times are, of course, necessary. I therefore welcome the new rules that aim to improve tachograph functions, such as the use of wireless communications for roadside checks in order to lower the number of vehicles stopped, as well as the provisions on the training of control officers. With a view to ensuring road safety in the European Union at all possible levels, it is of prime importance to affirm a clear and full principle of co-responsibility, and I therefore consider positive the compromise obtained by the rapporteur whereby the parties concerned must carry out regular checks in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006. With regard to the installation of tachographs in all vehicles which are not exempted, I would ask that we bear in mind that the obligations arising from compliance with the procedure must not overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises with financial burdens and red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
