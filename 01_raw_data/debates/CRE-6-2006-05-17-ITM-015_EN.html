<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Constanze Angela Krehl (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with its adoption of the Financial Perspective today, the European Parliament has taken an important step towards enabling the structural programmes to begin in the regions of the EU as early as possible, in 2007. We shall take a further important step tomorrow by adopting our proposals on the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy. I should also like to take today’s opportunity to make it clear once more that Parliament accelerated the procedure tremendously by dealing with these guidelines in parallel with the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the regulations on the funds, and I should like to thank all my fellow Members who are present for this debate, too. I apologise for the late hour, but it was the only chance of adopting this report before the end of the May session. Doing it any other way would have meant further delays to the overall handling of cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is comprehensive. Nevertheless, I have some important proposals to supplement and strengthen the policy approaches. These are based on the fact that EU enlargement in 2004 has exacerbated the disparities between the regions and on the fact that we have to use the scant resources available in a strategically intelligent and efficient manner. That is why we must also make more intensive use of the opportunities for private cofinancing in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">What do I wish to emphasise in particular in my speech today? Firstly, in my view, we must make it clear that cohesion policy should naturally support the Lisbon Strategy, but we must not forget sustainable development of the EU in accordance with the Gothenburg objectives in the process. Secondly, as we know, 80% of the European population lives in cities or urban areas, which means that we have to place greater emphasis on this dimension of our strategy. Thirdly, we must enhance the element of territorial cohesion in our planning: a demand also rightly made by the Committee of the Regions. Within the Commission’s three guidelines – making Europe and its regions more attractive for investors and labour, promoting knowledge and innovation for growth, and more and better jobs – we support the development of a durable transport infrastructure, including in border areas. In this connection, we attach particular importance to the implementation of environmental priorities such as Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and the sustainable prevention of natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to draw attention to the particular prospects offered by the use of renewable energy and, with it, the development of new technologies in this field. The development of research infrastructures and the utilisation of the research results for SMEs is an important concern in our strategy, as is access to modern information and communication networks.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these points are related to the development of an economy that creates more and, particularly, better jobs in the EU. However, another very important prerequisite for jobs is that people living in the EU be as highly qualified as possible. In this connection, the lifelong learning strategy is central to our report, and we support programme approaches for children and young people and for the training of workers, and the access of the elderly, too, to education. I should like to make it clear that discrimination-free access to the EU cohesion policy must be guaranteed for the future in respect of all the priorities set out in the report, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities. We want to be able to further use and develop the positive experiences gained with the old Community initiative EQUAL in the next subsidy period.</p>
<p class="contents">Social partners, and also organisations, associations and regional players, must be involved much more actively in drawing up the programme at regional level. Discussions with the Commission have revealed that a large number of our proposals can be incorporated into the Commission’s final proposal. This will enable us to take new strategic approaches to the work of the next seven years, which I warmly welcome. I should like to thank my fellow Members from the political groups for their broad support, and it only remains for me to call on the Council to adopt the whole package on cohesion policy as soon as possible. This way, we hope to reaffirm and reinforce the confidence of the European public in the solidarity of European policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I should like thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Community strategic guidelines for cohesion reflect the two key principles of the European Union’s future cohesion policy. These are the strengthening of the strategic dimension of regional and cohesion policy to ensure that Community priorities are better integrated into national and regional development programmes, and ensuring that there is greater ownership of the policy on the ground with a better partnership between the Commission, the Member States and the regions, including social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">With the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, cohesion policy has become the primary financial instrument at Community level to ensure that its resources are used for the implementation of the growth and jobs strategy. This is reflected in the priorities contained in the draft Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013, which seek to provide a balance between the twin objectives of the growth and jobs agenda and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the growth and jobs agenda, the guidelines call for the next generation of programmes to target resources on the following three priority fields. Firstly: enhancing the attractiveness of Member States, regions and cities by improving accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential. Secondly: encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy through research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies. Thirdly: creating more and better jobs by attracting more people into employment or entrepreneurial activity, improving the adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In sum, the guidelines provide a variety of priorities, with sufficient flexibility, which can be taken into account when designing investment strategies that differ across Europe’s regions. On the other hand, the guidelines also focus on a limited number of priorities to ensure that a genuine concentration of resources takes place in order to increase the effectiveness of investment and to make the growth and jobs strategy a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Council has come to a political agreement on the Structural Funds regulations for 2007-2013. For the Commission, the next step is to draft the final version of the Community strategic guidelines for the Council to adopt.

Perhaps the hectic and accelerated events and the debate on financial directives and funds have also contributed to the fact that we have not been informed earlier of the compromises arrived at by the Committee on Regional Development with regard to the excellent report of Mrs Krehl, compromises that will be submitted to vote in this House tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport, which gives high priority to the cohesion of the extremely heterogenous European Union, and to the infrastructural and tourism developments, which constitute the instruments for achieving cohesion. We admit that, due to the relatively strained Community resources, each investment must represent European added value, and must induce additional economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are giving priority to road and primarily cross-border railway developments, because this is where business inertia and reticence are at their highest levels. Apart from railways, we would also like to give priority to the development of inland navigation, because these are instruments that protect the environment and increase competitiveness at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We must give peripheral areas high priority, because the provision of access to such areas cannot be solved with a market-based approach, and regional development is a precondition of their competitiveness and of ensuring that the population does not move away; within the provision of access, we must also create bypasses and interconnecting roads. When we are financing TEN-T, we must understand that we cannot only accept TEN-T centres in old Member States, and the cohesion fund cannot solve every problem, for instance those in the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, we, the Committee on Transport, have supported the development of complex urban transport systems, the integrated development of suburbs, and Community assistance for this type of rolling stock. There is also a demand for the development of tourist areas, because this is what keeps people there, and we must keep tourism-generated revenue in Europe. For this reason, in our opinion, we urged that Community assistance be granted to regional airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not have any illusions: in new Member States, the involvement of private capital is not a magic remedy for market-based infrastructure development, especially in peripheral regions, because solvent demand is low, and the return on the investment is slow. This is why I support the utilisation of structural funds in PPP constructions, too. This may actually make investments efficient. I congratulate the draftsman of the report, I would like to thank you for your attention, and congratulations on the Barcelona victory, Mr President! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In accordance with the mandatory procedures, the European Commission will present the strategic framework after the package of regulations related to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund has been adopted. The European Parliament should expect the European Commission to identify priorities and courses of action in such a way as to maintain the essence of European cohesion policy while creating the conditions for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic guidelines should, as the rapporteur rightly points out, flesh out the framework described in the regulation rather than replacing or changing it. We are aware that the strategic guidelines will be the basis for the final versions of the National Strategic Reference Frameworks drawn up by the Member States. That is why it is necessary to formulate them in such a way as to avoid problems with their interpretation. In view of this I would also like to point out a few elements in particular which should feature in the Strategic Reference Frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges related to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy mean that the urban dimension of cohesion policy is gaining particular significance. It should become one of the main elements of the strategic guidelines. It will only be possible to achieve the aims of the strategic guidelines once there is better transport access, and that is why building transport networks, especially the transeuropean networks, is one of the basic tasks at hand. It will not be possible to reach the goals of the Lisbon Strategy if we do not create the conditions for implementing research and innovative development as well as support for the Seventh Framework Programme, which means that cohesion policy should create the right conditions for research and development. The strategic guidelines must be clear and easy to read and understand. That is something which the European Parliament has a right to expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Channelling the EU’s regional policy funds into projects which help improve development in more disadvantaged regions, as well as economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU, is the background to the guidelines to be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish in particular to thank the rapporteur for addressing this challenge and making a vibrant addition to the strategy document on Parliament’s behalf. It is quite right to be unbending when it comes to certain important principles. For that reason I am in favour of clawing back funds that have already been paid to the regions and Member States, if necessary, unless important key principles relating to European Union policy, such as sustainable development, equality, non-discrimination and the implementation of environmental legislation have been taken into account satisfactorily in the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, it is important to concentrate the dwindling funds that are available in such a way that the outcome is use of aid that is as effective as possible and achievement of European added value. An important aspect of this is the channelling of aid, for example, to sustainably renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of another matter. How might we administer regional projects by reducing bureaucracy, all the while ensuring that there is adequate financial control and supervision? Many projects unfortunately do not get implemented because the bureaucracy is more expensive than implementing the project itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You have listened carefully, Commissioner, as I too listened carefully to you just now when you gave your introductory address. Although you mentioned the regions several times, the word ‘city’ appeared only once in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, three weeks ago at the plenary of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Haüpel, mayor of Vienna, replied ‘That is unfortunately to be feared’ to a journalist who had asked the following question: ‘The urban dimension has been integrated into the objectives in terms of convergence and competitiveness. Do you fear that, unless something more specific is stated, it will fall by the wayside?’</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion are of crucial importance. Personally, I recommend adding a fourth priority to the Community’s strategic guidelines. This would be focused on cities and conurbations and on the role played by these. I am anxious to point out that by ‘cities’ our Committee on Regional Development means not only cities or urban areas but also, as Mrs Krehl’s report emphasises several times, any territory that includes a city centre, outlying urban areas and all the rural areas that depend on the city, as the city depends on them. All these territories indisputably constitute not only the places where 80% of our populations are concentrated but also places essential to the development of our Europe through the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Krehl’s report accords an important place to cities. The objective of my speech at this time is to point out, while regretting that the Presidency-in-Office is not represented, that the members of our committee or intergroup have on several occasions urged the Council to put pressure on the Member States with a view to their all taking account of the urban dimension on the grounds that it will not be possible to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives if the urban sectors do not play their full role within the framework of the cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">While regretting that the Council is not present, we anticipate your total commitment in this regard. The cohesion policy needs to be able fully to bear fruit as a result of the urban sectors participating fully in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has proved possible to orient the guidelines towards the principle of sustainable development. I wish to emphasise this point in particular, because the Commission has now moved away from according due importance to this. Earmarking, which has now been integrated into the general regulation through the back door as a competitor to the guidelines, causes problems in that it destroys the comprehensive approach of the guidelines, which is both horizontal and vertical at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Separating the Lisbon Strategy from the Gothenburg Strategy means that industrial regions and cities are the winners and rural areas the losers. I do not want to compete with the previous speaker, Mr Beaupuy, in saying that, as he is talking about the problem regions in the cities, in particular, but this separation calls into question cohesion in many regions – with disastrous consequences. I shall simply give the example of the country the Commissioner knows best. Following the earmarking, Riga and the surrounding area will obtain all the money, but the Latvian region fundamentally in need of support is Latgale, the poorest region in the EU at the moment. This will receive only the remainder of the subsidies, which cannot be right.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, these problems of the Commission’s own making can only be solved retrospectively if, in the operational programmes, the Commission ensures that, in all dimensions and for all areas – both urban and rural – sustainable development receives equal attention in the economic, social and environmental approach, that is to say, in a balanced development approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the Commission’s attention is insufficiently focused on this, there can be no real cohesion in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want first of all to thank Mrs Krehl for her report and for the open and inclusive way in which it was produced. There are some elements I disagree with, but the report goes some way towards bringing a measure of social and environmental balance into the strategic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the European Parliament to argue strongly for a more balanced set of guidelines and explicitly to reject earmarking and the thinking behind that approach, which would only compound the imbalances inherent now in Lisbon and in the present Commission guidelines. The championing of Lisbon over Gothenburg and of some elements of Lisbon over others in the Commission’s original guidelines is worrying. We must direct the guidelines in a way that reflects the principal function of cohesion policy and the holistic development of Europe’s regions, not just business growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome paragraph 9 of Mrs Krehl’s report, with its demand that sound partnership between all parties be enshrined in the regulations and guidelines and its support for the strengthening of civil society. I was particularly glad to hear Commissioner Piebalgs recognise that here this evening. Thanks once again and congratulations to Mrs Krehl on her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic disparities between the regions of the EU will only increase in the coming programming period – particularly as a result of the forthcoming enlargements – with no increase in Structural Fund appropriations – if we did not know that before today, we do now. In the light of this, it is now necessary to use the scant resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner, always bearing in mind that cohesion policy cannot solve all the structural problems or be a substitute for the efforts of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the critical appraisal of earmarking, for example, which puts us in fetters. There is a danger that the regions will not have the flexibility they need in developing the programmes to meet their local and regional requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise the particular consideration for the urban dimension, of which the Commission’s proposal takes insufficient account. Owing to their economic and social disparities, conurbations are in particular need of increased assistance. The use of private cofinancing to aid the implementation of all the programmes is very important. This needs to be emphasised time and again, particularly at a time when public funds are scarce – and this opinion is in fact shared by the majority of all the members of our Committee. It is essential to promote private cofinancing at project level. Public-private partnerships are, unfortunately, too little used in connection with the Structural Funds, since they raise a host of legal questions that have to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">A welcome development is that the negotiations on the Financial Perspective succeeded in largely harmonising the different standards within the framework of cohesion policy for the old and new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support Mrs Krehl’s report and would like to thank her for a truly excellent job and for her constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to raise a couple of matters and particularly to emphasise the significance of the social economy and the development of the infrastructure for IT.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise the development of the infrastructure for IT. </p>
<p class="contents">The social economy as a model for sustainable development, with its capacity to reconcile the economic and social fabric in the regions by coupling the spirit of entrepreneurship with social purposes, combating passive dependency on social welfare systems, needs to be recognised and taken into account in social and territorial cohesion policies and frameworks at European, national and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is that a social economy brings entrepreneurship and creates job opportunities at local and regional level. A social economy targets socially excluded goups, for example the long-term unemployed. A social economy means innovative entrepreneurship for minority groups and it increases empowerment and strengthens civil society. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> I also wish to emphasise the importance of the development of the infrastructure for IT. IT and its infrastructure have exactly the same importance today as roads and railways have long had and continue to have for growth in Europe. If new companies are to be able to work in all the regions, there must be IT and infrastructure in place to make it possible for them to work effectively. It must not be allowed to be the case that it is not possible to work out in the regions because of an underdeveloped IT infrastructure. I therefore think it good that this is emphasised in the Commission’s document and in Mrs Krehl’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The process of implementing common rules for these funds is an arduous one, and those of us from the new Member States still have fresh memories of what happened in 2004 when we had to deal with months of delays, time that has been difficult to make up. I would therefore call for an agreement on the directives on the structural funds to be concluded at the earliest opportunity. I feel it would be unfortunate if the agreement were to run aground or be postponed as a result of Parliament insisting on certain requirements right up until the last moment, cost what it may. An agreement needs to be reached as quickly as possible so that adequate time is set aside for operational programmes to be drawn up at national level. The last bone of contention between the Council and Parliament is the issue of the Community reserve. I should like to point out that the Council has agreed that some Member States, including the Czech Republic, will have their structural fund allocations adjusted in 2010 as a result of updated economic growth estimates. It would therefore only be fair to address the issue of the reserve from this point of view, because economic growth in some countries has evidently been underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us is, to my mind, a well-balanced text that will contribute towards an agreement with the Council. I agree with the criticism that has been levelled at the earmarking of resources for the aims of the Lisbon Strategy. As things stand, and given that the Commission in particular is insisting on the principle of earmarking, I at least welcome the fact that this is not intended to affect the new Member States, which will have to invest mainly in infrastructure and in combating unemployment, in light of the backwardness of many of their regions. I also feel it important to point out that the urban dimension has not been catered for sufficiently. Cities face a range of problems. That being said, I welcome the fact that the Commission is in favour of lifting the current ban on using money from the fund for housing. In the new Member States especially, there are many neglected, run-down high-rise estates, the renovation of which is taking a great deal of time on account of the lack of public resources. I should like to thank the rapporteur for this report and would recommend its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, following the approval of the multi-annual budget for the European Union’s challenges for 2007-2013, which come at a time of some stagnation and confusion following the effort of enlargement, these guidelines make more sense than ever, since they represent an effort to focus the scant financial resources effectively and intelligently, in order to achieve the maximum added value, as the rapporteur herself has said.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore doubly grateful for Mrs Krehl’s great sensitivity towards the diversity of the different needs of the regions and the flexibility of their solutions, with particular attention for regions – from mountain regions to the outermost regions – suffering structural disadvantages, such as depopulation, ageing or difficult access.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also grateful for her insistence on actively promoting equal opportunities between men and women as a transversal condition. There can never be too much of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we welcome the innovative and modern restoration of the Delors growth and investment approach, with the call for sustainable transport infrastructures – railways, collective transport and maritime transport – their accessibility and the optimisation of traffic management and road safety and, above all, the need to complete the trans-European networks, particularly where there has not been sufficient development at the borders between States, as in the case of the Pyrenees in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept its call for the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly water, and the development of sustainable energy sources combined with savings and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight Mrs Krehl’s ability to understand the requirements of the specific relationships between cities and their surrounding areas, taking the approach of an integrated economic area, which in my city, Zaragoza, we call 'the fourth space'.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress Mrs Krehl's argument that we need to reduce the technological gap between regions and Member States, through the enhancement of technological cooperation networks, and her particular sensitivity towards promoting the development of SMEs and innovation potential, in terms of R+D.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to thank her for all of her efforts aimed at improving employment and the integration of immigrants, and also her view that the situation of workers must not be worsened under any circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, this is not made clear enough in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the earmarking of appropriations under the Lisbon Strategy, which has been introduced surreptitiously by means of an annex to the Structural Funds General Regulation, is in danger of further exacerbating inter-regional or sub-regional disparities which, I believe, have in no small measure contributed to the constitutional deadlock in which we at present find ourselves. That would, moreover, particularly be the case in countries and regions in which a premium is placed on the objectives of competitiveness and employment. Indeed, the obstacles to development vary, and are different, according to the geographical situation of the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I should like to emphasise that accessibility remains an indispensable prior condition of the more or less peripheral or isolated regions becoming competitive and, therefore, of their perhaps subscribing to the Lisbon Strategy. Earmarking, under the terms of the annex I mentioned, would, if applied rigidly, hamper these regions by preventing them, in particular, from funding vital transport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we are talking here about highly technocratic arrangements which, I believe, would make the EU’s regional policy still less transparent and still more incomprehensible to our fellow citizens. Is that really what we want? Obviously not. That is why, Commissioner, it is important for it to be clearly confirmed to us that there will be acceptance of the necessary flexibility, both in the National Strategic Reference Frameworks and in the regional operational programmes. Having discussed the matter a little with Mrs Hübner, I got the impression that she was alert to this issue, but, really, I should like the Commission to take due account of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This trend is about to strengthen with the forthcoming accessions of Romania and Bulgaria. It is therefore obvious that the question as to how to spend these resources in the most efficient way is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States, which are the main beneficiaries of cohesion policy, have specific socio-economic needs that need to be appropriately taken into account. Therefore, I warmly welcome this document and the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, who committed herself to ensuring that the available resources will be used in an intelligent, efficient and concentrated manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the rapporteur’s recommendations on links between the cohesion policy and the Lisbon Strategy, as they will bring sustainable economic growth and lasting, quality employment. I also welcome the links between the partnership principle and the territorial dimension, as well as the emphasis on more environmentally sustainable transport, national resources management, equal opportunities, lifelong learning and urban development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is paramount that we ensure that all Member States will be able to adopt their national strategy frameworks in time, so that programmes can start as soon as 1 January 2007. What is at stake here is the Union’s objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion. Despite the legitimate disappointment on the level of available resources for cohesion policy, it will be possible with appropriate rules for spending and programme implementation to achieve a great deal of improvement with regard to helping those regions which are lagging behind to catch up in socio-economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add that I am optimistic and am quite sure that this report will attract broad support during the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to say a few words on one issue that particularly concerns me, namely the risk that we run of subordinating cohesion policy to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. The risk is a real one and should not be overlooked. Otherwise we may to some degree warp the concept of solidarity and of balanced, harmonious development of the territory – concepts that lie at the heart of cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the predominant factor of the Lisbon Strategy is competitiveness, we run the risk of channelling structural funds as a matter of priority to the least favoured regions with the greatest potential for development, to the detriment of regions with less development potential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true of the nine new Member States, whose territory is made up entirely of convergence objective regions. I therefore call for the necessary balance between competitiveness and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
