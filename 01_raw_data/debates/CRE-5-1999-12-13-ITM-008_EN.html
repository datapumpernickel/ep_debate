<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, it all sounded so terribly technical in your announcement, but in reality this legislation significantly improves the protection of those who are victims of a road accident in another country. I mention this because we are obviously no longer capable of expressing ourselves in such a way that people can understand what we are talking about. We can be proud of this directive. It is a joint effort on the part of the European Parliament, which took the initiative, but also the Commission which improved the original Parliament proposal considerably with the addition of the compensation body. We can, however, also be grateful to the Council for accepting the essential points contained in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the recommendations for the second reading are concerned, I should like to concentrate on two points. The vast majority of the amendments concern drafting points and the legal text itself. Parts of the Council's common position are virtually incomprehensible. I am even convinced that the authors themselves do not know what on earth they have written. I should like to remind both the Commission and the Council of a very fine quotation from a 19th century German jurist, who said that the legislator must think like a philosopher and speak like a farmer, simply and clearly and so that people can understand. The artistry involved in trying to find a compromise is usually reflected in the legislation, and the principle of speaking simply and clearly becomes out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, there remains a problem of substance, where we in the European Parliament hold a different opinion from that of the Commission and the Council. I should like to remind the Commission and the Council that in this matter we have the support of the profession, the insurers, who incidentally are the ones affected by the provisions of the whole directive. We also have the support of the automobile associations and we have the support of the organisations of accident victims. The only people in the whole world who still oppose this are the Commission and the Council. What is it about? It is about this directive also applying if the accident has not taken place in a Member State of the EU but in a third country. There is not the slightest reason for excluding this case from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the example of a Frenchman and an Italian who have an accident in Switzerland. Why should the directive not apply in this case? Why not indeed? The insurers shake their heads and say that of course it can be done. There is one insurance company which disagrees – a British company – but all the others are asking, why not? By adopting this directive, we are not making any changes to substantive law, we are not in any way changing the court of jurisdiction, we are not in any way changing judicial procedures. The one and only difference is that the accident victim from France – to use the same example – does not have to contact the Italian insurance company in Italy directly but the representative of the Italian insurance company in France. That is all. Wherever the accident has happened – for example in Switzerland – any further procedures, if there is no agreement, are not affected one jot by this directive. It only regulates the settlement of disputes before they reach the courts, not in court.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, that is why I am making this request. Clearly specific interests have been at work here. It was even claimed by the Commission in a trialogue that European insurers were against my solution. The truth is different. They are in favour of this solution. Hence my recommendation, Commissioner: I urge the Commission to rethink its position. It is untenable. I assume that the Council would then also accept this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise once more that this is not a proposal which has been dreamt up in a bureaucratic ivory tower. This proposal is the result of countless discussions with all of those involved. That is also why I think that it is practicable, because those who have to deal with it in practice are after all telling us that it works, it works extremely well, and that is what they want. Usually the Commission takes account of the interests of those involved. Ask those involved then, and you will see that the solution proposed by the European Parliament meets with their approval. There is, therefore, no reason for the scope of this directive to be restricted. This is in fact only to the detriment of accident victims. We should not forget that! Surely what we want is to improve the protection of accident victims. That is why I make this plea: we should all reconsider this matter in the forthcoming conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important firstly because – as the rapporteur said – it is one of these completely successful cases of taking advantage of the opportunities made possible by the former Article 138B of the Treaty of Maastricht, in other words, this Parliament is launching an initiative that will be taken up by the Commission and followed up by the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur said that this is also an example of good cooperation between the three institutions. However, I would like to highlight the hard work, which has been notable and entirely praiseworthy, almost Herculean, of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, throughout the process, from the conception of the basic idea to the follow-up, full of passion and rigour, of the legislative work that has been carried out. </p>
<p class="contents">This is also an important directive, however, because now, when we are so concerned about the indifference of European citizens – who do not turn out to vote, who feel that Europe is very distant from them and who do not know whether Brussels is anything more than a place which produces what they perceive to be obligations – this is a good example of what our citizens really feel and understand to be the case. This is something that they will notice in their daily lives because any of them may have a car, and any of them, even if they do not travel abroad much, will have the idea that “well, if I do go abroad at least I will be covered”. It offers some security. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important for another reason. Mr President, I would like to say most emphatically on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, that the large majority of us support the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, on the only point of real controversy which, as he has made very clear, is its field of application. There is a, shall we say, technical problem in the way it will apply but we will have to resolve these issues from a technical point of view. We utterly refuse to change the philosophy of it. This Parliament has shown itself to be clearly opposed to moving from the idea of a binding law to the idea of a voluntary pact between people who are insured with a voluntary subscription on their part. </p>
<p class="contents">From that starting point, we can discuss the matter. If it is true – and it is true, and I was the first to recognise this as I was quite opposed to this idea, defended from the outset by Mr Rothley -, that some technical modifications will need to be made, then so be it. Let us not forget though that these modifications are to some extent an unnecessary clarification – and Mr Rothley is right in this – because in no case can a directive affect private international law or the rules of procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">If these clarifications need to be made, we will make them. If an item needs to be revised, it shall be revised. If we need to make a modification, we shall do so. However, Mr President, in any event, the Group of the European People’s Party maintains that we will not change our philosophy. We are not prepared to replace this philosophy of binding law with another one that is completely uncertain and not very favourable to the European citizen, to a voluntary subscription scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – I would like to start also by congratulating the rapporteur on this report. A motor vehicle accident in any circumstances can be traumatic, all the more so if it involves personal injuries. If we add to that an international dimension where the victims find themselves in a foreign country, the problems may be multiplied: differences in language, procedure, inability to identify or trace the third party, let alone deal with insurers. The mere identification of the third parties is often lengthy and time-consuming. Once the insurers are in touch, matters are often settled by negotiation. This directive would be a welcome step in ensuring that the respective foreign insurers get in contact quickly and the proposals for settlement are promptly forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, so good. But our rapporteur wants to go one small step further and I feel, as others have already said, that we should support him. This relates to accidents in third countries. Let me spend a moment to share with you a case I had in private practice as a lawyer before I was elected to this Parliament. It concerned a German national who had an accident in Turkey, caused by a UK national. That claim was being negotiated by insurers in two Member States, and if it had been litigated, it would have been litigated in the UK, probably according to UK law. So tell me where the problem is. This is what happens in practice. There really is not a difficulty with including the small further step which the rapporteur is asking for. The difficulties that have been thrown up can be overcome if there is a will to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would just like to say one small thing on the question of damages. I hope that we will come back to this in the future. The measures or the methods of calculating damages across the European Union differ vastly. We would do our citizens a great service if we could move towards harmonising this area as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have here a good example of a Europe which is close to the people. I should like to say quite clearly that the changes resulting from the transposition of this directive will ultimately benefit all the people of Europe and will also be experienced by them firsthand; they will not – as is often the case with other legislation – perhaps constitute an indirect benefit or not be entirely transparent. This is a problem which it is highly probable that everyone in the European Union will experience once at some stage in their life, and then they will obviously benefit accordingly from the directive. I think that this also needs to be mentioned explicitly here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my thanks to Mr Rothley, the rapporteur, for preparing this report so thoroughly and for taking the initiative – it was of course also Parliament from whom the initiative came at that time – but I would, however, also like to thank the Commission and the Council for agreeing to this in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, understand why the problem which has been mentioned here should continue to exist, because so far I have not heard one single comprehensible argument against accidents involving EU citizens in third countries being included in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">So far every argument against this has been unsatisfactory. Sometimes it is simply incorrect information – this also became clear in the last debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as far as the attitude of the insurance industry is concerned. I would simply ask the Commission and the Council to make an effort in this matter and go along with Parliament's position.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the trialogue's preliminary discussion was inconclusive, at present we simply have no choice but to insist on our good and reasonable amendments and to adopt them once more here at this second reading. This will then give the Council and the Commission the opportunity to be more shrewd in the conciliation procedure. They should use that opportunity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important element in the interinstitutional balance because it shows that, when it asks the Commission, in accordance with the usual paths laid down by the Treaty, to carry out one of its well-founded requests, Parliament will find the Commission to be an attentive and willing partner in dialogue. This is also in line with the demands made by Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party in particular at the time of Romano Prodi’s appointment as President of the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Rothley’s report should be adopted in its entirety: it is a high-level compromise, the synthesis of a series of stimuli and innovative concepts, and the result of the cooperation between the various institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk for a moment about, for example Amendment No 4, which deletes Recital 26. It is obvious, in fact, that, if a legal person, in the performance of one of its duties, should compensate a prejudiced party, it may not be denied the right of subrogation in the claims of the injured party against the compensation body. Also, Amendment No 11 should be emphasised. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true, the problem remains of the accidents that occur in third countries: I hope that we can manage to find a solution that safeguards Parliament’s decision, which aims to extend the scope of the of the directive’s application to these cases but at the same time, without prejudice to the Council’s concerns regarding respect for the principles of international private law. We should all work on this point, primarily the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, and the Chair of the committee, Mrs Palacio. </p>
<p class="contents">A future legislative initiative could address the insurance sector once again, in particular, regarding some degree of harmonisation of the regulations regarding the compensation of harm occasioned to persons, which is creating many disparities and injustices in the European Union. The Spanish example, once suitably adapted, could be an interesting base to work from. I invite everyone to carefully consider this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the fourth directive on motor vehicles forms an important step in the process to fill the blanks in the EU directives on motor vehicle insurance and to reinforce the internal insurance market in this respect. As you know, more than 500,000 car accidents occur within the Community every year. The existing system for damages to EU victims of accidents which take place outside their country of residence, is inadequate. A swift and pragmatic solution is required in order to protect a very large number of visiting car drivers. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend a warm thanks to Parliament for having requested this directive. This is the first occasion on which Parliament has used its new competences pursuant to Article 192 of the Treaty. The Commission has fully backed this request and has urged swift approval of its proposal. I would especially like to thank Mr Rothley for all his efforts to bring this debate and this directive to the point it has reached today. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that the common position established by the Council is well-balanced and coherent. It faithfully represents the problems which have caused Parliament to press for EU legislation. It adopts the salient points of the Commission’s proposal and takes account of 24 of the 36 amendments, either wholly or in part, which Parliament requested at first reading. This is quite something. </p>
<p class="contents">In its reaction to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Commission is mainly led by the ambition to bring about a legal instrument which meets all the requirements of the policy holders of an EU motor-vehicle insurance as effectively as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to expand on the amendments. I applaud Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12, because they reinforce certain principles of the common position, such as the freedom of the insurer to choose a claims representative, the possibility of such a claims representative working for more than one insurer, as well as linguistic requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">I can also accept Amendment No 13 which promotes the reinforcement of consumer protection, although the word “immediately” used in this text needs to be elaborated on further in order to avoid discrepancies in the application of this provision by the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to concentrate on Amendments Nos 1, 2, 8 and 9 which have been submitted by the rapporteur and which are intended to further extend the directive to include accidents occurring in third countries between two parties resident within the European Union and who are covered by insurance taken out with EU insurance companies. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you of the reasons which led the Commission to reject these amendments at first reading. Firstly, the indemnity mechanism laid down in this directive and other directives on motor vehicle insurance is based on the green card system. This cannot be extended to include third countries which do not take part in this system and which do not recognise the validity of European insurance agreements. Insurance companies would not agree to cover these risks or would command extremely high premiums. Whichever way, the authorities of third countries would require vehicles visiting from the EU to conclude insurance agreements with companies based on their territory, at the border. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the application of the directive, especially the provision which offers the possibility of lodging a direct claim against insurance companies, may contravene rules of law of third countries concerning legal liability and international private law, particularly when the direct claim is not recognised under these rules of law. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, these amendments would lead to incompatibility with Article 5(3) of the directive concerning the information centre and Article 7 concerning the impossibility of identifying the vehicle or the insurance company. </p>
<p class="contents">These four amendments concerning accidents in third countries, in my opinion, cannot be accepted at this stage and in their current form. In the event that a consultation procedure proves to be inevitable, the Commission can consider extending the scope of the directive, taking the above into account. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make another comment regarding this possible extension. As already stated, this directive is based on the green card system. There are 39 countries who take part in this system. Of these 39 countries, alongside the European Union, alongside the fifteen Member States, there are also six countries which have signed the multilateral guarantee agreement. These countries are Switzerland, which is of key importance because many accidents occur there, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. These are six countries, in other words, which form a sub-group of the group of countries which participate in the green card system. In an attempt to meet the wishes of the European Parliament, the Commission is prepared to back a compromise proposal, whereby the directive, at least the scope thereof, is extended to include the countries mentioned by myself but not to include other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will be clear that if a French and a Belgian driver, both from EU Member States, have an accident in Australia, for example, and a dispute arises between the insurance companies which cover these two drivers, it would be extremely awkward to allow direct action at the location where the accident, far removed from the European Union, took place under circumstances which are hard to verify. As far as this is concerned, the Commission, and I refer to the position also adopted by the Council in its viewpoint, can hardly meet the requirement of the European Parliament as quite remarkably and extremely skilfully expressed by Mr Rothley. We are not in a position to do this. But perhaps the MEPs and the rapporteur, in particular, could take my last point into consideration and we could then see to what degree the scope of this directive could be extended to include the six countries mentioned by myself. </p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, Mr President, the directive as it stands, its current scope being the European Union, already covers 99% of accidents. If you add Switzerland and the five above-mentioned countries, then I think that we are not far off the one hundred percent mark. I would strongly urge Parliament to consider accepting the Commission’s helping hand and to take advantage of the Commission’s proposal to extend the scope to include the six countries mentioned by myself. After all, Mr President, each compromise must clearly identify the third countries to which the directive can actually be extended. Moreover, we must avoid any solution contravening third-country legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would now like to comment on the remaining amendments. The Commission is of the opinion that the draft amendments prejudice the legal security of the proposal and will have a detrimental effect on those insured. This is not intended, of course. I will run through them very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 is said to omit references necessary to rule out conflicts with national rules of law. Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 14, 15 and 16 are said to leave out certain considerations and provisions which aim to guarantee legal security, transparency and financial security of the imported redress mechanism. By incorporating Amendments Nos 7, 17 and 18, a key component would be deleted on which all car insurance guidelines are based, namely the reference to the agreement between national bodies of indemnity as a basis for the redress mechanism. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, Amendment No 19 has dropped a general provision which is proposed for reasons of consumer protection and subsidiarity. I therefore have to inform Parliament that the Commission is of the opinion that the proposed Amendments Nos 3 to 7 and 14 to 19 are a step backwards from the point of view of an effective legal instrument of the European Union. For this reason, the Commission has to reject these amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, the Commission wishes to remind everyone how much progress we have made with this proposal. The common position satisfactorily guarantees that damages are paid for the vast majority of accidents involving EU citizens outside their country of residence. I have already mentioned this but would very much like to reiterate this. According to the Commission, the common position, which has come about so thoughtfully, forms an important extension of the protection of insured parties within the European Union. It is the Commission’s sincere wish to ensure that this proposal be transposed into Community legislation at the earliest opportunity. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission would like to assure Parliament that it will play an active and constructive role in facilitating a compromise in the event that the consultation procedure seems inevitable, which I, in fact, hope will not be the case. I hope we will not have to resort to a consultation procedure. One dreads to think what this procedure might lead to. Should we fail to reach an agreement, then this entire directive would be scrapped and this would be extremely regrettable. I would like to convince the MEPs and Mr Rothley, in particular, of this fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
