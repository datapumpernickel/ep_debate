So this is not a referral back to committee, but simply a referral of the legislative resolution forward into a better future.

As regards the superlevy, I should point out that a more flexible superlevy is not something which can be achieved overnight. In the meantime, we are discussing a possible review of the operation of the milk system, about half‐way through the conversion period, so in 2003 or thereabouts, and consequently I would prefer it if we could take this matter up again after that review has taken place.</p>

We have a report which admittedly covers only one aspect of the whole dispute over bananas, but in the present delicate situation we should be careful not to make any mistake here, perhaps as a result of having too few Members present in the House. I have the feeling that, because we need 314 votes, there ought to be rather more Members present for this vote. The fact is, though, that we were given the common position of the Council on 5 November. So I would ask the presidency to check whether we can still vote on this report in Strasbourg, given the low number of Members present, or whether the deadline for doing so has automatically expired. I would urge my colleagues to come back to the Chamber, otherwise we shall have no means of influencing this procedure if we cannot obtain the necessary 314 votes.</p>

I regard this as a major policy success, because we keep on saying that the autonomy of the regions and nations has to be preserved, that we must only do at European level things which cannot be done at national level, and this principle holds true also and above all when it comes to the funding of agriculture. We must not have the funds going first to Brussels and then coming back from Brussels. It is feasible and would make better sense for a proportion of these funds – 25 % or even 50 % – to be provided by the regions and the states themselves as their contribution to financing agriculture. That will also reduce the chances of mismanagement and fraud: the money can remain in the hands of the Member States. I think this is a good idea and a good resolution on the part of the European Parliament, offering sound guarantees and prospects for the future, and for that reason I voted for the Mulder report with a clear conscience.</p>

Firstly, agricultural and food production should be driven by consumer demand; secondly, production should be sustainable in the long term, both ecologically and economically; and thirdly, the EU should be contributing towards worldwide food security, for example by ensuring that the principles of free trade are upheld in the agriculture and food sectors. Free trade should, however, be compatible with the interests of consumers, animal protection and regional and environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that in the long term, both restrictions on production and subsidies under the COMs should be phased out. The financial resources thus released could be used for investment in regional industrial development, infrastructure, rural development and environmental services, which may well be necessary as a result of reform. In the long term, agriculture – like other sectors – will generally have to operate on the basis of market conditions. During a transitional period, however, temporary support may be required to enable the adjustments to be made in a way that is acceptable from a social point of view. Well‐defined measures are needed in order to meet the vitally important environmental goals, as well as to promote rural and regional industrial development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also convinced that the reduction and eventual abolition of market support measures and better adaptation to free market principles will lead to a reduction in the cost of the agricultural policy. In order to achieve this goal, some additional pressure on the EC budget, of a temporary nature, may be acceptable. In the long run, however, there will be a reduction in agricultural spending. We regard this as an urgent matter, since it would facilitate the forthcoming enlargement of the Union towards the east.</p>

<p class="contents">By calling into question and continually reducing the share of the Community budget for agriculture, which is what the ‘Agenda 2000' proposals and the CAP review proposals are doing, what is in reality being called into question and undermined – and this moreover without any further attempt to hide the fact – is the decisive role played by agriculture hitherto in most of Europe's regions, especially in the south. The European Union is constantly reducing its existing agricultural workforce, since now its declared aim is to save resources and to prepare for the predatory enterprise of enlargement towards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, so that European monopolistic capital can respond to the new regime of the World Trade Organisation from 2000 onwards, with its notorious submissiveness to the demands of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">We disagree with the rapporteur's view that pre‐accession aid to the applicant countries should not be entered under a separate category and that it should be included in the guideline, in order to reduce the burden on the rest of the budget. Pre‐accession aid must be a separate category, not included in the guideline, so as to prevent a reduction of the already savagely reduced resources available from the Guarantee Section for farming in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With compulsory cofinancing of direct aid by the Member States, this proposal heralds a flagrant and unacceptable intrusion in the national budgets of Member States, on what are effectively conditions of submission. This not only contravenes the provisions of the Treaty, but indirectly prepares the ground for a substantive transfer of compulsory expenditure to national budgets – with no prior opinion from the national parliaments – for policies and decisions adopted by the EC executive. With a surfeit of hypocrisy and populism, and in the name of an illogical so‐called rationalisation which goes against any notion of solidarity, a misrepresented renationalisation is being sponsored which will nevertheless relate solely to expenditure, while the Community will retain exclusive powers to determine every detail of the CAP – quotas, price and export subsidies, taxes and so on – without any margin of flexibility or any scope for the Member State itself to frame its own agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are categorically opposed to this Commission proposal, and there is no room for ‘its better management'. It is our duty to oppose and reject such a policy, which is against the interests of small and medium‐sized farmers and growers.</p>

The agricultural policy is definitely in need of reform. However, this should not be carried out in a way or at a speed that is detrimental to either agriculture or employment. Slightly smaller price cuts are therefore in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Some crops will have to be used for purposes other than food, for example as fuel and in industrial processes. Europe should embark on a wide‐ranging programme aimed at bringing about a switch from petrol to environmentally friendly fuels. A ceiling should be set on the amount of agricultural support that can be given to individual holdings. Additional support should be made available to less‐favoured regions, particularly in northern Europe, so as to ensure the survival of farming in Sweden and Finland. Quality assurance should be introduced for agricultural methods and products. In general, support should be geared more towards environmental purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Cofinancing by the Member States should be allocated on the same basis as assistance from the Structural Funds. However, it should be possible to vary the amount according to the needs of different countries and regions. Naturally, farmers should be adequately compensated for lower prices which reflect price falls on the world market. Where the relevant environmental or animal welfare legislation is not applied, it should be possible for payments to be withheld. However, in the case of organic food production, price cuts should not be too large or happen too quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The present system must be reformed in line with market principles in terms of paying for what is produced, and support should gradually be phased out. This is what had been decided in Sweden just before we joined the EU. More support should be provided for environmental and rural development. It is also what many farmers, as well as a significant section of the general public, would like to see. If the enlargement process is to be carried through, then agriculture will continue to be dependent on some EU funding. The timescale for this should therefore be extended.</p>

In my view it is far too cautious. Nothing less than root‐and‐branch reform of the CAP will do. A CAP designed for the Europe of the 1950s is no longer suitable for a Europe entering the new Millennium. Radical reform will benefit consumers, taxpayers and most farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">For far too long the people of the North West, like every one else, have been paying the price (literally) for the failure of the CAP. Consumers have been paying too much for their food bills, taxpayers have been paying too much for their tax bills, and hard‐pressed small farmers and hill farmers have not received the support they need. Indeed, it is hard to see who actually gains from the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer, of course, is large farmers backed by their Tory allies. The Tories have always been the large landowners' lackeys. They supported them during the BSE crisis while Labour supported consumers. They continue to support them on fox‐hunting while Labour – like most people – support a ban. Once more, in championing CAP reform, it falls to Labour to stick up for the interests of ordinary people.</p>

<p class="contents">The proposal for a reform of the COM in beef that the very same Commission is now proposing to us is in complete contradiction with its desire to promote environmentally friendly agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission actually wants to abolish the specific compensation for the production system that is most environmentally friendly: the production of suckler cows. Rather than consuming imported proteins, these suckler cows eat grass and use pasture land.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of agricultural production, which is mainly practised in less‐favoured and environmentally sensitive areas, will eventually disappear if the Commission"s proposals are accepted as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has therefore tabled several amendments to enable this form of production, which responds to the particular expectations that consumers have in terms of both health and safety and of land management, to be re‐established. The removal of this type of production would in fact weaken areas which are already suffering from major desertification.</p>
<p class="contents">As for lowering the price by 30 %, this is unacceptable. The world price for beef is half the European price. This 30 % reduction will therefore not be any help in gaining market shares, but it will weaken the sector as well as considerably reducing the incomes of a category of farmers that already earn the least.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to compensate for this reduction in prices, the Commission envisages partial compensation through direct aid. This direct aid will be called into question by our partners in the WTO (the former GATT).</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, what is being proposed today is a major reduction in the price of beef, for which there will only be partial compensation, and from 2003 onwards we will be told that in order to fulfill our international obligations we must reduce compensatory aid. At the end of the day, the only ones who will lose out are the farmers, whose income will be reduced unless they increase their production by using growth promoters (hormones). Once again, farmers will be confronted with a dilemma: either they disappear, or they use technology that is not in keeping with ethically responsible behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group will vote against the Commission"s proposal if the amendments that it has tabled are not adopted and accepted by the Commission.</p>

Unfortunately, some reduction is inevitable in view of the imminent accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In these countries a high proportion of people"s incomes goes on food, even though food prices are relatively low. Current EU guaranteed prices would be disastrous for those countries and a serious obstacle to their accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Lowering guaranteed prices to world market level is going too far, in our view. Livestock breeders in the EU are entitled to continue to be assured of a decent income, this being the raison d"être of the CAP. So a lowering of guaranteed prices must go hand in hand with a raising of compensatory payments, which cannot be paid if there is no longer any price support.</p>
<p class="contents">Not enough attention is given in the Commission proposal to limiting production, as the rapporteur rightly points out. Set‐aside and quotas are useful for limiting surpluses, which work very much to the disadvantage of developing countries. But limits on production must not lead to an artificial shortage, so that market prices rise far above guaranteed prices.</p>

This is the reason for the position adopted by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which is opposed to any reduction in the price of milk.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, more than 90 % of European milk production is consumed on the European market, so why does the Commission reject the system of ‘double price, double quota" that is used in some countries such as Canada? Rather than maintaining a European price for the milk consumed on the European market and defining, on the basis of a specific quota, an adjusted price which will enable companies and cooperatives to market their processed milk products in third countries, without any refunds, the Commission prefers to lower the price of milk across all European production.</p>
<p class="contents">That reduction will only encourage producers to increase their productivity, either through intensification or by expanding their farms.</p>
<p class="contents">During this legislature, we have experienced the painful problem of BSE. We all know that this problem was linked to the feeding of suckling herds. Why, therefore, should we encourage further intensification?</p>

In our view, the premium for silage maize should be phased out, for the simple reason that it has a distorting effect on competition for those countries in the northern part of the Union where the climate makes it impossible to benefit from this support measure.

As a result of the ban on animal meal feed for cattle following the BSE problem, the European Union"s level of self sufficiency has fallen from 20 % to 10 %. Instead of promoting a policy of developing protein‐rich foods, the Commission seems to want to destroy the industry by drastically reducing the compensatory aid to that sector. Protein‐rich foods, as well as being useful for reducing the European Union"s dependence on the United States and Brazil as its main suppliers, are also an important sector of production in agronomic terms, as they are an ideal rotation crop for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another rotation crop is maize. In that sector, the Commission"s proposals are unacceptable as they stand. If we apply the reform as proposed, European maize production will be dramatically reduced. I would point out that a quality rotation crop means that wheat on wheat rotations for the soil can be avoided. All farmers know that the absence of a rotation crop reduces the quality of the soil and obliges them to increase the use of fertilisers and phytosanitary products.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, rather than drawing up their own sophisticated technocratic proposals, the Commission staff in Brussels should make the effort to gain a little more knowledge of the agronomic constraints on farmers. Some directives and some regulations aim to make European farming more environmentally friendly, using less fertilisers (nitrates directive) and less phytosanitary products (directive on residues and liability for food products). However, there is a total contradiction between those positive steps and the proposal for the reform of the COM in cereals which has been submitted to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to compensate for the shortcomings and weaknesses of the Commission"s proposal, our Group has tabled several amendments, and if they are not accepted by the Commissioners we will be forced to vote against this proposal.</p>

<p class="contents">The reports reflect the unwillingness of the majority in Parliament to accept the reforms and policy changes which the common agricultural policy so badly needs. In particular, the Garot, Fantuzzi and Goepel reports resemble nothing more than an attempt to sabotage the reform process instigated by the Commission and the Council. The Commission's proposal to cut intervention prices as a means of restructuring is being thwarted by the requirement that full compensation should be paid through direct support, and that new support measures or other forms of market intervention should be introduced. Such requirements imposed by the majority in Parliament reduce the scope for an active policy of rural development, which is badly needed if we are to provide alternative ways for farming families and other country dwellers to earn their living.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission's overall efforts to bring about agricultural reform, particularly the importance it attaches to a broader rural development policy. We also support the proposal that there should be less intervention. However, we are doubtful – or indeed critical – regarding some of the specific proposals, for example the so‐called horizontal measures, and every possible outcome needs to be more carefully examined. It is also regrettable that there is no detailed description of the environmental implications of the various reform proposals, a shortcoming that should be corrected. In any further work on reform, it will be impossible to avoid addressing the question of export subsidies, which apart from being a problem in themselves also adversely affect the global food situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that any major reform process has to be carried out gradually and taking account of the wider social implications, particularly as regards the many small farms that still exist in some Member States. We are opposed to an unfettered free‐market approach in the agricultural sector on the lines of New Zealand. Any such policy would further undermine the global market and damage food production in the third world. Farming serves to sustain us, and should be treated as a special case to which it is inappropriate to apply dogmatic economic principles and market philosophy.</p>

Our amendments were duly considered, yet it is obvious that these amendments – although positive – can only amend parts of the regulations without altering their basic content or aims.</p>
<p class="contents">We should have prevented the present reform from being a mere extension of the 1992 reform by eliminating the discrimination which this reform introduced and worsened among farmers, regions and products, with profound consequences in terms of the reduction in the number of holdings, the abandonment of the countryside and the ruin of small and medium‐sized holdings and family‐based farming.</p>
<p class="contents">We should have prevented the attempted submission to the WTO and rejected further price reductions which will generate further falls in agricultural income – which in Portugal has already fallen by 13 % in each of the last two years – without full and total compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should have rebalanced the funding by drastically limiting the support to large farmers and directing it instead to small and medium‐sized holdings. This would have introduced genuine modulation instead of accepting the mockery which the Commission is intending to introduce.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore voting against the proposals on the reform of the meat, milk and cereal sectors and the regulation on horizontal measures and we want the position of the Socialist Group against the principles of genuine modulation to go on the record as we feel this is highly relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also voting against the proposed regulation on the financing of the CAP in which one amendment was approved, tabled by Mr Cunha in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. This amendment opens the door for the Commission"s proposal for the cofinancing of this common policy to be approved. With this door opened by this Portuguese Member it will certainly be easier to renationalise the costs of the CAP, which will further worsen discrimination and exacerbate the negative consequences for internal cohesion, disregarding the Treaties themselves and calling into question the basic principles of solidarity.</p>

<p class="contents">‐ reforming the Structural Funds in order to complete enlargement in time and to give assurances to our American partners in WTO negotiations; </p>

Although certain points need adjustment, it has been an effective and efficient instrument for supporting European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the rural development interventions should be included in the guarantee section of the Fund, so as to ensure modernisation and diversification beyond Objective 1 programmes, and I would stress the importance of including in that section actions designed to improve the quality of agricultural food and non‐food products, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that European producers receive an adequate return on capital invested.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that the rural development measures under Objective 1 and the Community Initiatives should be included in the guidance section. As regards Parliament's supervisory powers, I believe the House should intervene at the payment stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the need to ensure national financing of income support measures for farmers, thus strengthening the principle of subsidiarity in aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I accept the Commission's proposal for establishing a new system whereby direct support to farmers is reduced on the basis of a digressive sliding scale depending on the manpower employed and environmental requirements, but I do not think it is right to impose a maximum intervention ceiling linked to respect for environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In general I think it is important that the Agenda 2000 reform of the CAP should be in place by next spring and should still guarantee protection for the interests of small farmers while providing consumer protection and market orientation measures geared to protection of the environment. Small farmers represent a large percentage of the predominantly agricultural economies of some European regions – for example Southern Italy – and they must be able to count on compensation for the greater costs imposed by the reform.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is regrettable that, in calling for aid for the retraining of banana producers to be included in the programme, Mr Liese"s report is going along with our opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the paradoxical position, having amended our COM in accordance with the demands of the WTO, of having to defend its conformity against an opponent, the United States, which is refusing in advance to abide by any decision that does not rule that the COM is incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Even beyond the obligations that we have to our development partners, which are just as important politically as the obligations to which we agreed in the WTO, the current banana crisis is a test case and its outcome will set a precedent: it will either be proved that respect for the law and for international commitments are legitimate demands, or else globalized trade as we know it today will hereafter only have one rule, that of unilateralism, and the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying issue in this dispute is in fact the following: what objective is the American administration hoping to achieve through this outbidding process? What drives a country that does not produce a single banana to take the risk of triggering an economic war with Europe, the Caribbean countries and part of Africa? Maybe, for the United States, globalization simply means applying American law on an international scale?</p>
<p class="contents">The day before yesterday, when Commissioner Brittan presented the various sides of the banana dispute to the Committee on External Economic Relations, he blamed the crisis on certain multinational companies, particularly Chiquita. That explanation oversimplifies the issue. It is in fact the ‘transatlantic dialogue" as a whole that is being severely put to the test. It is the usefulness of the TABD and the summit meetings that is being questioned. The real question that the banana crisis is asking us is this: Do we or do we not accept the law of unilateralism, bypassing the WTO time and time again?</p>

The step which has been taken here today is in my view a partial victory for the philosophy that wishes to get rid of these battery cages. It is not happening fast enough, in our opinion, but it is a partial victory that the amendments seeking to abolish this method of production over the next ten years have been adopted.

The overwhelming majority of people condemn factory farming and the battery system. The fact that more and more free‐range eggs are being bought and that more and more retailers are now moving towards the sale of free‐range eggs demonstrates the concern of people in many countries of the European Union.

The cages are so small they cannot even stretch their wings. The battery farming of hens is also unnecessary. British consumers are able and willing to buy eggs from free‐range hens. They would rather pay slightly more for their eggs than support inhumane farming methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain's Labour Government is leading the way. We have announced our intention to phase out the battery farming of hens in the United Kingdom. This is in sharp contrast to the uncaring attitude of our Tory predecessors who always put wealth before welfare, whether for hens or for humans.</p>
<p class="contents">An effective ban must be an EU‐wide ban, however. Battery hen farmers must not be able to ply their cruel trade elsewhere in Europe. For Britain, famously a nation of animal lovers, such a ban cannot come soon enough.</p>

The regular heated debates in our national parliaments, regional institutions and in the media leave us in no doubt about this. Sociologists and demographers all agree that it is the family that binds together a social system. Without the family unit, there cannot be a well‐functioning society. If we all accept this, we should also recognise that it is vital that our national governments should be concerned about the family given the fact that the population is ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">Who knows better than the family how to fight against marginalisation and isolation? Who is the prime source of education for children? Who is taking more and more responsibility for elderly and disabled members of the family? Who ensures that there is solidarity between generations? Although the answers to those questions would be almost identical in the fifteen countries of the European Union, the support provided by the different Member States varies considerably. Family policies are extremely disparate, and as the family does not have any authority which is recognised in law or in legislation, so far no efforts have been made to bring them into line with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this state of affairs, the European Union must act through its own institutions and through the governments of the Member States in order to put forward these arguments: there cannot be a balanced society without active support for the family.</p>
<p class="contents">Pro‐family policy deserves to be supported by comprehensive measures which place the child at the heart of society. A family policy cannot be limited to just paying out allowances and benefits, but should also encompass the problem of housing, recreational infrastructures, care facilities for very young children, out‐of‐school support, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the advances made by international bodies, children are increasingly in need of protection. In this area, family structures can also play a key role, by fighting against poverty, child labour, child prostitution, violence and paedophilia.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the Hermange report and its provisions, as they show a real will for genuine action to be taken and are not simply a catalogue of broad ideas. I am referring, for example, to the very specific measures aimed at evaluating the impact on the family of every European measure introduced. The European Parliament has a major role to play in such plans.</p>

<p class="contents">Top‐heavy population pyramids, pension schemes under threat, social protection in danger, a very alarming decrease in the proportion of the population that is working – there is also no end to the list of catastrophic consequences of the demographic slump.</p>
<p class="contents">The Grand Panjandrums of politically correct thinking are forever attacking the family, especially when it is based on marriage. However, most inconsistently, the very same people bemoan the consequences of their ideological frenzy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, clear that even though the structure of the family has evolved over time, it has always been the natural context for caring for children, for the development of individuals, for solidarity between generations and for educating young people, and an assurance for the future and for the stability of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hermange"s report contains some excellent elements, for example the proposal for all Community acts to be accompanied by a family impact statement, and we can only support the request made for Member States to conduct <span class="italic">’</span> specific family policies supporting and protecting the family financially and in its role as an educational and social force and a source of solidarity between the generations".</p>
<p class="contents">However, insofar as family policy does not fall under the competence of the European Union, we could be forgiven for having doubts about the proposal to create a ‘clearly identified unit" within the Commission. As we are all aware of the tendency that this eminent institution has to continuously extend its powers, we might be justified in fearing that it may drift off course and go against the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I have to say that I regret that the rapporteur rejected all the amendments tabled by our Group for reasons that had nothing to do with their substance, but simply in order to conserve an agreement that had been made with the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</p>

<p class="contents">Along with our rapporteur, I think that each level of authority needs to grant a significant place to child care and child support policies, while respecting the principal of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, it would be useful for the Commission to examine in detail the policies that should be pursued by the various levels of authority, in order to ensure that children have the best possible conditions in which to develop.</p>

In fact, in all the time that the European Parliament has been sitting, there has never been a report on this issue, which is such a sensitive one.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until now, for reasons of ideology and hostility towards the protection of families and children, our institution had not considered this very important issue. Legal arguments were put forward, using the principle of subsidiarity as a pretext.</p>

<p class="contents">To the authors of those amendments, which defend the family as an essential component of our society, with the family based on a couple offering a solid educational framework, I would like to say that I agree with them and wholeheartedly support them.

Many of the ideas and intentions in the report are also good, and I can support them. However, I have two major complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the report indirectly implies that a family should be defined as comprising a man, a woman and children, in accordance with the usual practice. However, I should also like to see other family situations being recognised, for example homosexual couples with children. In Sweden, we are currently looking into the possibility of whether homosexual couples should be able to legally adopt children, a move of which I am in favour. It would have been helpful if this aspect had been dealt with in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, many of the requirements and intentions relating to the protection and welfare of children are currently dealt with at national, regional or local level, in other words closer to the parties concerned. I do not think that issues relating to the treatment of children should be dealt with at EU level, for a number of reasons. We must respect the principle of subsidiarity. Naturally, this does not mean that I approve of the way in which children are treated in Greece, for example. However, there are widely differing reasons for the problems that exist, and EU involvement would only serve to complicate the situation. It goes without saying that countries and regions should share their resources in terms of information and capabilities.</p>

<p class="contents">It is true that fishing involves wastage of resources, mainly as a result of fish discards.</p>
<p class="contents">The report presented by our colleague Mrs Hardstaff highlights this problem and its complexity very well.

<p class="contents">With regard to the use of trawl nets with square mesh, we should be aware that several scientific studies have shown that this type of gear is, in some circumstances and for some species, less selective than the traditional cod end nets. This is why the Council, when it adopted Regulation 850/98, did not consider it appropriate to generalise the use of that type of gear.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the use of drift nets, this is the first time that this type of gear has been associated with the problem of fish discards.

<p class="contents">The EU is going in exactly the same direction as the United States and what many of us wonder about is will EU taxpayers eventually find themselves subsidizing EU arms manufacturers as they try to compete with the U.S.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe the boosting of the arms industry is totally irresponsible and runs counter to efforts around the world to end armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">How the unsuspecting taxpayer can end up helping the merchants of death (the arms manufacturers) is clearly outlined in a special report by the Arms Trade Resource Centre World Policy Institute in the U.S. The report states that the Cold War has not brought an end to U.S government subsidies for weapon exports, instead government support for weapons exports has increased in the form of taxpayer‐backed grants, loans and promotional activities. And if the plan to expand NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic goes ahead then the subsidies are likely to increase even more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nineteen potential NATO members are receiving Pentagon Foreign Military Financing. These funds are being drawn from the FMF financing that has been allocated to the Partnership for Peace programme. The Clinton Administration's foreign aid submission to Congress makes it clear that these Partnership for Peace monies are specifically designed to ‘Prepare countries for NATO membership" by supporting ‘acquisition of NATO compatible equipment."</p>
<p class="contents">These findings make it clear that firstly, Partnership for Peace is only a stepping stone to full NATO membership and secondly, that Partnership for Peace is very much connected to the principle of helping weapons manufacturers to sell weapons to these countries, countries who do not even have money to provide proper health care and education for their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the U.S is unwilling to pay its debt to the United Nations it is quite willing to write off arms exports loans. During this decade alone, the U.S has written off or forgiven $10 billion in loans for military‐related exports including $2 billion in guaranteed loans for militarily useful technology to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 Norman Augustine (former CEO for the major military contractor Lockheed Martin) toured Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia with the goal of ‘drumming up business and supporting the largest possible expansion of NATO." In Romania, Augustine even promised to support their bid for NATO membership as a follow‐on to Romania's purchase of an $82 million radar system from Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p class="contents">Lockheed Martin is one of a number of U.S arms manufacturers who will be supplying funds for a pro‐NATO expansion foundation that is being established by the Romanian Embassy in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the U.S who are supporting NATO expansion with the primary aim of finding new markets for their weapons, EU weapons producing countries are taking the same approach. In 1996, the former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind flew to Slovenia en‐route to Bosnia. In subsequent newspaper reports it was suggested that he told the Slovenian government that their acquisition of better military hardware would be one of the preconditions for British support for their bid to join the EU and NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of the cold war has not brought an end to excessive support for arms manufacturers, instead the EU has pushed along with the U.S to expand NATO and to find new justification for arms manufacturing and weapons exports.</p>
<p class="contents">The stark reality is that EU and U.S arms manufacturers have helped fuel conflicts around the world and coerced poor countries into buying weapons which caused death and destruction and diverted much needed monies away from essential services such as health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of vested interest groups such as EU arms manufacturers in EU policy on this issue is totally unacceptable. The involvement of the WEA and others is clear proof that any EU policy on arms will clearly favour, support and boost the arms industry. The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU is clearly designated to help the arms manufacturers as stated in paragraph three on the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Will EU Member States not involved in this wretched trade be dragged in? What we should be doing is pushing for conversion to non‐weapon production. The vast sums of money used in the arms industry and the technical expertise which it requires should be reallocated to helping people not killing people. If the same efforts were directed towards helping cure diseases, solving world hunger and environmental degradation then the world would be a far better place and there would be little justification for military blocks, armed to the teeth with weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group voted against the Titley Report today because it supports and values arms manufacturers and the arms industry over and above the safety and welfare of the EU citizen, a policy the Green Group could not possibly condone such a policy.</p>

This report makes this and a number of other points well. At the same time, however, it covers such a wide range of subjects that the focus is totally lost. The ELDR Group has tried to remove some of the most unrealistic and undesirable proposals from the text. Our group prefers a transfer of funds out of defence and into the environment, rather than the achieving of environmental and health objectives via defence.</p>
<p class="contents">We tried to get the most problematic paragraphs voted out of the report, but did not fully succeed. Consequently, my group has abstained in the vote.</p>

We are aware of the problem that there are not sufficient resources in the world to cope with the environmental problems which already exist and those which are yet to come. We therefore consider it an excellent initiative to call on the Member States to restructure their armed forces so that they can be used in environmental disaster situations. We support the committee's view that preventive environmental work is an important security policy instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to point out that it is the Member States which are to be called upon to set up centres, train military personnel and take account of the environment, and definitely not the Commission or the Council. We support arms reduction, the abolition of nuclear weapons and the environmentally sound destruction of arms in general. We also think it a splendid idea to call for openness and public information in relation to national defence. We further support the call to train military personnel to enable them to deal with environmental problems. We have voted in favour of those parts of the report which call on the Member States to take account of the environment during military exercises. We also take a positive view of the requirement that the military should clean up after exercises, and so on.</p>

I object to the basic idea of raising the EU's foreign and security policy profile. This report seeks to promote the coupling of the CFSP aspects of EU policy with the EU's trade, aid, development and international environmental policies. The report reflects the idea of having a common corps, organised militarily under the auspices of the EU. I fear that despite the well‐intentioned environmental considerations, this common corps is merely the starting‐point for an actual military force under EU auspices, which would be assigned real military tasks both inside and, not least, outside the area of the EU. I do not wish to legitimise general military cooperation through ‘military environmental cooperation'.</p>
<p class="contents">I can support that part of the report which deals with arms reduction, the abolition of nuclear weapons and the environmentally sound destruction of arms in general, and can also endorse the calls for openness and public information in relation to national defence. I have voted for those parts of the report which call on the Member States to take account of the environment during military exercises and so on. But for the reasons I have indicated, the People's Movement against the European Union is unable to support this report.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
