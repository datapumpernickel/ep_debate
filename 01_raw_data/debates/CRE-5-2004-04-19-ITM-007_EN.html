<p class="contents">This proposal concerns the setting of MRLs: maximum residue levels for pesticides in food and feed. It is a delicate subject, since I do not know of anybody who actively wishes to have pesticides residues in their food. However, in modern agriculture they are an unavoidable by-product of agricultural production methods. Our duty here is to set out a legal and administrative framework whereby consumers are protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time permitting trade in agricultural commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that this legislation is not designed to regulate the use of pesticides and I do not wish to enter into discussions on the broader subject of pesticide use here today. That is covered by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides, on which the Commission will be bringing forward amendment proposals at the end of this year. Let us look, rather, at the proposal before us. This proposal has several objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it aims to simplify. It went through a SLIM exercise with stakeholders in 2000 and 2001, and it consolidates and replaces four existing directives and replaces them with a single regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it aims to achieve, at a stroke, harmonisation of MRLs across the Community. We have been setting MRLs at Community level since 1976, and have still not even reached the halfway stage. This means that for most substances and commodities, 15 and soon 25 different national sets of rules apply. This is hardly compatible with the single market. By introducing the possibility of temporary Community MRLs, we can harmonise everything in a short time, pending the outcomes of evaluations of active substances under Directive 91/414/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we will introduce a role for the European Food Safety Authority in the risk assessment of MRLs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, we will introduce clear and transparent procedures for all interested parties in the setting or modification of MRLs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, by introducing the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we propose a solution for residues of the 400 substances we have already taken off the market, of which we do not want to see any residues in food. Some of these are unacceptable substances; many are substances which industry did not want to support in the 91/414/EEC evaluation programme and for which we have no information one way or the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we aim to strengthen provisions on monitoring and control measures.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main objectives covered by the proposal, which I hope can enter into force by 2006, 30 years after our first efforts in this area, during which we have seen major changes in science, in trade, in politics and in consumer protection. I commend this proposal to you as a major advance in consumer protection and I look forward to the forthcoming discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sturdy (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the Commissioner has beaten me to it and said virtually everything I had planned to say. He and I are very much in agreement on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I start, I wish to add to what the Commissioner said about the Food Safety Authority, which is of fundamental importance. It is a plea to this Parliament and to the Commission and everyone concerned that there should be sufficient funding to ensure that the Food Safety Authority can do its job. The committee felt very strongly about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully welcome the proposals on harmonisation of maximum residue levels in foodstuffs throughout the European Union. For too long there have been variations from country to country. As the Commissioner said, it is very important that a product consumed in one country should be just as safe in another country. It is to this end that I have worked closely with the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add my thanks to Mr El Khadraoui, the Socialist shadow rapporteur, because we managed to table a number of compromise amendments which, with his help and help from other Groups, have alleviated some of the problems, because there were a number of disagreements. As I said, my aim was to produce something that would not only lead to safety, but would also be workable and sets workable standards. As the Commissioner said, I have taken a lot from Directive 91/414/EEC, which covers plant protection products, and I wish to add to that. I am sure that the committee will – as far as possible, as we resubmit amendments – feel that they are important for the functioning of this legislation. I said that we are resubmitting some: we are not resubmitting all the amendments that failed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, because it was rather pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now go through the amendments we are resubmitting so that colleagues will understand why we are resubmitting them. Amendments Nos 74 to 78, which deal with temporary MRLs, bring the legislation more into line with Directive 91/414/EEC. I feel certain that we have managed to do this in a way that does not compromise public health, because public health is the precise aim of this piece of legislation. Amendment No 74 explains why temporary MRLs are needed. Producers have four years from inclusion of full product dossiers for re-registration. Amendment No 77 deals with the practicalities; the four-year procedure will be used only when Member States request it, and then it will depend upon them showing the necessary research on the product. This amendment fell by three votes in committee, but, if Parliament were to adopt it, it would really add something to the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding amendments resubmitted by colleagues, Amendment No 67, concerning the setting of MRLs, covers vulnerable groups. We are all aware that vulnerable groups need protecting, but again existing legislation covers that and therefore there is little point in agreeing on that amendment, even though I am sure my colleagues will disagree with that. At no time would Parliament ever take out legislation that supported that.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 69 concerns integrated pest management. There is no such thing as a set of standards on integrated pest management. There are, however, different types of farming, and therefore it would be misleading to say that it favours non-chemical methods, because agriculture is agriculture. No farmer – and I speak as a farmer – wants to use chemicals unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add one last point that is of particular importance. One of the amendments tabled by Mr Lannoye concerns import tolerances. This is of particular importance because my brain tells me that we should not accept this amendment. My farmer's heart, however, tells me that we should, because it is a legal way of stopping imports into the European Union. I shall use my common sense and recommend that we vote against Mr Lannoye's amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is addressed to the Commissioner: for those who have food, there are many problems; for those who do not, there is only one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much as I welcome harmonised, simpler and more uniform legislation in the field of pesticide residues, it would be even better if we could seize the opportunity to increase consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Half of our fresh food contains pesticide residues, and there are increasingly more cases of various residues – up to 14 no less – in one product. That is why, when MRLs are laid down, more account is taken of vulnerable groups by introducing additional safety factors and by introducing aggregated parameters for additives or synergetic effects. In this connection, we have asked that MRLs be stipulated on the basis of best agricultural practices, particularly integrated agricultural methods involving the lowest possible dosage and spray frequencies. Not only should MRLs be laid down in a different way, but also more and better residue research should be carried out. Financial penalties when MRLs are exceeded should make their enforcement more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that consumers are entitled to information about ingredients, and so they are entitled to know to how many pesticide residues they are exposed. Measures of this kind contribute to healthier food of a higher quality for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made a good few improvements: we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices. It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor. However, looking at what has been proposed, we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management, which everybody should welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to aggregate MRLs, if, for example, there are two or three different pesticides, but they are all below the MRLs, the combination should say that they should not be on the market. That is the same logic that we have been pushing for years in relation to drinking water. We are glad to see that this has now been accepted. There are lots of pesticides, but no proper analysis is available. If there is no valid lab analysis and no detection methods available then the pesticides have to be taken off the market. Authorisation must be withdrawn on these. If new scientific evidence reveals a risk, the same should apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments we tabled in committee asked for zero tolerance for imported products. These were rejected as the majority thought it was necessary to give specific MRLs for imported products that are not grown in the EU, such as tropical fruits. We have tabled this amendment again. I say to Mr Sturdy that the purpose of this amendment from Mr Lannoye is not about stopping imports but about protecting consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested, it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise. We have tabled some amendments again. We hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Permitted residue levels for crop protection products differ to a considerable degree from one Member State to another, and that is why it is a good idea to lay down maximum residue levels.</p>
<p class="contents">To us, however, the amendments to the text are essential indeed. The Commission proposal focuses far too little on the protection of consumers and far too much on that of agricultural interests. I should like to bring three things to your particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, maximum values for residues must be kept as low as possible. Public health and best agricultural practices should be normative in this respect. I should like to say right now, Commissioner, that non-chemical control should take precedence over chemical control. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, children are particularly vulnerable because their livers are not yet fully developed. Research in the Emma Children’s Hospital in Amsterdam has shown that certain residues can seriously hamper children’s development. It is therefore of the utmost importance for children to be adequately protected, and so I would ask you all to support Amendment No 67.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, clear and strict regulations would eliminate the current distortions of competition when crop protection products are allowed to be used. That would be a welcome development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for the broad support on the Commission proposal in this important area. May I express my thanks once again to Mr Sturdy, the rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in bringing this to a conclusion. I am heartened that we share a common understanding of the objectives to be achieved by this proposal: simplification, consumer protection and the achievement of the single market through harmonisation. I would also note that Parliament's deliberations and discussions echo many of the themes and issues raised in the Council discussions. As far as the Council is concerned, I understand that a political agreement will be sought next week and a common position before the summer break.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the consistency in views between Parliament and the Council – views shared by the Commission – I am confident that we can now move forward rapidly towards early adoption of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made good progress in setting out the legal and administrative framework whereby consumers will be protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time ensuring that there is a single market by permitting trade in agricultural commodities. There are seven specific topics that arose in the discussions on which I would like to focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the notion of a default limit-of-determination MRL. This is very important. By accepting the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we have found a solution for residues of the 400 substances we took off the market in 2003 for which the remaining residues should have moved out of the food chain by 2005. This means that, if we do not set a specific Community MRL, we do not expect to see any residues. This should help to avoid nasty surprises in future and give us a legal tool to help fight misuse of pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of a default MRL, however, raises a problem – what to do with all the national MRLs that we already have and that are not yet harmonised. Here we are introducing the concept of temporary MRLs. I recognise that the issue of temporary MRLs raises some anxieties, but can assure you that the European Food Safety Authority will be involved in this process. It does not mean that we are suddenly increasing consumer exposure to residues. On a positive note, the setting of temporary MRLs will finally achieve harmonisation and will centralise the MRL process, ensuring that high standards are established and maintained in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Also on the positive side, our proposal aims to screen these temporary MRLs and to remove those that are clearly unacceptable whilst permitting the existing situation to continue, pending the detailed evaluations undertaken under Directive 91/414/EEC. Please remember that we are not changing any agricultural practices here. Whatever residues that have been circulating over the past ten or twenty years will still be circulating tomorrow at the same or at lower levels, but not at higher levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to agricultural practices, I recognise the desire that there should be a preference for non-chemical methods of agricultural production over chemical methods. However, this is not the appropriate text to regulate that issue. Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides governs agricultural production and I intend to bring forward proposals to amend it later this year. These proposals will be submitted as part of a package together with our proposals on the sustainable use of pesticides. I am sure that there will be ample opportunity at that stage to discuss the broader issue of chemical and non-chemical methods.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to recognise the new role of the European Food Safety Authority. I am sure that this will improve consumer protection and the scientific basis underpinning decisions taken. I know what Mr Sturdy said about the support, financial and otherwise, for the European Food Safety Authority. The Authority should also have an important role in risk communication and provide a reasoned voice in relation to the acceptability of any risks involved. Not only will consumers be protected; they will be seen to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">EFSA will also be deeply involved in scientific issues. Immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, cumulative risk assessments: these are emerging issues where the regulatory science is still trying to catch up with the latest advances in research. We will be looking to the Authority to help us make progress in this sphere, not just in the context of setting MRLs but also in the scientific data that we will be requiring in the dossiers that industry should be submitting to us under Directive 91/414/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to the setting of temporary MRLs as leading finally to the achievement of the single market in this area. However, let us not forget the global aspect. The Community is one of the biggest importers of food in the world. Consequently we also import a lot of residues. This proposal will set up for the first time a clear procedure for import tolerances, for assessing those residues and for ensuring that only those that are deemed acceptable will be allowed. This is an important obligation in relation to the WTO: any decisions taken on the acceptability or otherwise of imports will be based on clear procedures and a sound scientific risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the strengthened provisions on monitoring and control measures should boost confidence among all parties and ensure that we have the tools available to justify and to maintain that confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament. I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this sitting.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
