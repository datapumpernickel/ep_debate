The Assembly House of the Estates was the first Parliament building constructed for the purpose in the Russian Empire. It was there that three of the four estates of the Finnish autonomous grand duchy used to assemble.</p>
<p class="contents">On the agenda at the meeting, there were four main items: firstly, EU/Russian relations, including the current situation in the EU and Russia; secondly, the northern dimension; thirdly, cooperation in the fight against crime; and, fourthly, current international affairs, in which the focus was on the forthcoming OSCE Summit and the situation in the west Balkans. The most positive result of the summit was Russia’s EU strategy. This strategy reflects the greater importance of the EU in Russia. The strategy is now being analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my speech I will focus on Russia’s internal situation, in particular, the situation in Chechnya. In addition, I will speak about the EU’s common foreign policy, the fight against crime and the northern dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Putin said the Russian economy was growing in most areas. He said foreign trade was having a positive impact on the economy. There was more effective collection of taxes, and the rouble had steadied in value. Next year’s budget will be based on a growth rate of 1.5%. According to Mr Putin, Russia has a growing market economy, based on the principles of the rule of law. One of the problems of economic activity, however, is that bartering still plays too large a part in commerce. The bank system must also be improved. Furthermore, central and regional budgetary relations have to be redefined, and Russia’s still very closed economy opened up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Putin gave a lengthy account of the situation in Chechnya. He said that, despite speculation, a state of emergency would not be declared for the whole country on account of the situation in the northern Caucasus. He said the government would not be provoked, and democratic elections would be held in due course. He also stressed that the government would continue to fight against terrorism in Chechnya. Russia has created a security zone and is feeding the 100,000 people who have left the region. Mr Putin’s tone was on the whole tough when he spoke on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Putin was self-critical and admitted the Russian government had made a mistake, in that it had not handled the situation well with regard to Russia’s nearly 20 million strong Muslim population. Dialogue with moderate Muslim leaders had also been neglected. This had created a space for fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian situation in the region is growing worse all the time. It is good that the UN humanitarian evaluation expedition is able to travel to Ingushetia to investigate the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Representing the country to hold the presidency, Prime Minister Lipponen, and the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, were urging Russia to initiate action to de-escalate the crisis. Both firmly stressed that a political solution had to be found for the conflict. Military action could not solve political problems or remedy the desperate economic situation in the region. In the opinion of the EU, the solution also requires dialogue with the Chechen leaders. The Union totally condemns such disproportionate use of force, of which civilians become the victims. Prime Minister Lipponen furthermore stated this to the press on his visit to Parliament earlier today.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on the whole our impression was that the Russian government unfortunately did not seem to have any clear plan for a lasting political solution to the situation in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">After this there was a short debate on the EU’s common foreign and security policy. Prime Minister Lipponen and High Representative Javier Solana gave a presentation to the Russian delegation on the development of the common foreign and security policy. Mr Lipponen said the presidency was drafting an EU report on crisis management and peacekeeping capabilities for the European Council in Helsinki. Mr Solana added that special consideration was being given to how Europeans could work together in the implementation of the Petersberg Tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fight against crime, it was stated that the European Council at Tampere had been fruitful. Regional cooperation is important in the fight against cross-border crime, and Russia is a key partner in cooperation. The Union is drafting an action programme to counter organised crime, which will be debated in the seminar on organised crime to be held by the EU and Russia in Helsinki. The action programme should be ready at the start of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Putin also underlined the importance of fighting against organised crime. He mentioned drugs, money laundering, corruption and terrorism as the main areas of concern. He said the Duma had just adopted a convention for the extradition of criminals. A convention on money laundering would also soon be ratified. Mr Putin stressed that it was important to move from words to deeds. TACIS aid would also be needed in the area of combating crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia would also like to increase cooperation in issues relating to the prevention of the trade in human beings. Trade in human beings is practised in the northern Caucasus, among other areas. Workers belonging to the Red Cross and other relief organisations have been captured. </p>
<p class="contents">Drug smuggling, according to Mr Putin, was a special problem in Central Asia which, broadly speaking, if you included Afghanistan and Iran, had overtaken Latin America as the most important drugs manufacturing centre in the world. The added problem for Russia is that its borders with Central Asia are open.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words about the northern dimension, whose aim it is to increase well-being, strengthen security and prevent environmental pollution, nuclear risks and the dangers of organised cross-border crime. All this will also play an essential part in cooperation between the EU and Russia. Prime Minister Putin said that Russia wanted to play an active part in this work. It is important for Russia that the region is comprehensively developed.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr Sasi has admirably summarised the results of last week’s European Union/Russia summit. As Parliament would expect, the summit was inevitably dominated by straight talking on Chechnya with the European Union, as the presidency indicated, pressing for de-escalation, for a return to political dialogue, for proportionality in the use of force to deal with terrorism and a solution to the humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about that and then concentrate briefly on two other issues that loomed large in our discussions: implementation of the partnership and cooperation agreement and European Union enlargement and the northern dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission very much shares the deep concern of all Member States about the present situation in Chechnya. One of the immediate priorities, particularly as winter approaches, is to ensure humanitarian assistance for the tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict. The Commission has decided in principle that ECHO could make available straight away EUR 1.2 million to help relieve the situation in Ingushetia and Dagestan. The Russians are open in principle to offers of humanitarian aid but we have still some way to go in discussions with them before European Union aid can be distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we can go ahead we need further assurances from the Russian authorities on the security arrangements for international aid workers on the ground. There is too much recent history for us to avoid that important issue. We have also been pressing them to arrange for aid agencies to visit the area to assess the needs on the ground and I hope that this mission will now take place in the coming days.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission broadly welcomed progress on implementation of the partnership and cooperation agreement. Although naturally the summit did not go into the detail, there was a clear awareness of the importance of a strategic European Union/Russia partnership whatever the present difficulties. In this context, the economic cooperation initiatives that we have launched with Russia are, in general, developing well. For example, we are making significant progress in ensuring better protection of intellectual property rights. We have launched a major programme providing young Russian managers with periods of practical training in firms in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between experts is advancing in a number of other areas including the environment, coping with the millennium bug in Russia and the more efficient use of energy. By contrast bilateral trade relations and investment are not developing as well as the Commission would like. The European Union is rightly extending export opportunities for Russian companies in EU markets to boost the Russian economy. But there is unfortunately less progress in the other direction. We have repeatedly asked the Russian authorities to address the obstacles which stand in the way of European Union companies’ expansion in Russian markets. These include excessive certification and testing requirements, as well as specific concerns like the continued charges on international airlines to fly over Siberia. The decline in European Union exports to Russia since the financial crisis of August last year underlines the need for action in these areas. Minister Sasi indicated some of the things which are necessary in order to improve conditions for direct foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Prime Minister Putin welcomed European Union enlargement as a force for political stability in Europe. The Russians are understandably taking a very close interest in the enlargement process and the European Union is ready to engage in a serious dialogue with them in the partnership and cooperation agreement framework. However, the Commission has always made clear that it would not be appropriate to set up a special mechanism or some form of trilateral consultations with the applicant countries as requested by Russia on various occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Russian worries about the economic impact of enlargement, President Prodi stressed the benefits in terms of lower tariffs and improved access to the markets of applicant countries. The benefits will be even greater if Russia can bring her technical norms and standards closer to those in the European Union, helping her to gain access more easily to the expanded commercial opportunities of the enlarged single market. A fundamental principle for the Commission is that enlargement should not create new dividing lines in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit, Prime Minister Putin was very positive about the northern dimension. He said that he not only wanted cross-border zones but large areas of north-west Russia to be covered. We agreed that detailed proposals should be discussed at the Helsinki Conference in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Kaliningrad, as a future <span class="italic">enclave</span> inside the European Union, represents a particular challenge within the northern dimension. Partner countries to the northern dimension, including the European Union applicant countries neighbouring Kaliningrad, show increasing interest in cooperating on the issues raised by its unique situation. Already through Tacis and other European Union financial instruments the Commission is supporting the process of economic transition in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not an occasion on which we had a complete meeting of minds. How in the circumstances could it have been? But for all that I think it was a useful meeting and I very much hope that the Russian Prime Minister will reflect on all that we said, particularly perhaps on the northern Caucasus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the major projects that we are continually occupied with in this House such as enlargement and reforming the institutions of the European Union are evidence of how vital and ambitious the European Union is. Fortunately, these major projects have not produced a Union that is in any way, shape or form turned in on itself. On the contrary, the EU is taking its responsibilities towards the rest of the world more seriously than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Drawing up a common strategy vis à vis the Russian Federation is one example of this. The fact that it is one of partnership and cooperation is regarded as a miracle by the Cold War generation even now. It is an expression of the Union’s self-confidence. In building strategic partnerships of this kind the Union is showing itself to be an authority that is able to take the lead in preventing and resolving serious international problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The document that the Council has produced is aimed above all at fostering the development of the Russian Federation as a democratic constitutional state with a well-functioning social market economy. In fact this approach strongly resembles the policy that we are pursuing with regard to the candidate countries. It comes as no surprise that there is talk of how vital it is for shared values to form the basis of such relationships. That is why it is really astounding that it is often still difficult to send experienced managers from EU Member States out to candidate countries and to the Russian Federation. I think the Commission’s services ought to be very careful in their dealings with all those who want to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in our interests to ensure that Russia is given the opportunity to maintain former trade relations with the applicant countries. That is also a sore point of course. The candidate countries themselves sometimes fear losing markets in Russia, some of which they have already lost.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson we have learnt in the course of the enlargement dialogue is that prosperity and security are not brought about first and foremost by attempts to introduce a market economy, but by establishing a democratic constitutional state. If this is not in place then the business community is certainly in no hurry to invest in the country concerned. In pursuing the establishment of a market economy we are therefore going to have to remain alert to the grave mistakes that can be made when companies are privatised. For that matter, having a halfway house situation as far as the old state of affairs and legislation are concerned can also lead to serious abuses taking place, with a few people getting rich, many being reduced to poverty and the importance of the common good as a political value being forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore appropriate for the leading elite in the Russian Federation to take a critical and common sense attitude. We must ensure that our financial assistance does not help corruption to flourish. What it must do is foster the integrity of public administration and a sense of responsibility on the part of the citizens, employers and employees. Markets are destroyed by corruption. A good partnership also has responsibilities towards third parties. The Russian Federation has itself already demanded this where the former Yugoslavia is concerned. Opinion differs in this House as to the quality of the Russian contribution towards settling the various conflicts there. Power is sometimes regarded as a hindrance rather than a help. It is also strange that foreign policy should be spurred on by ethnic preferences.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Now that there is so much unrest in the Caucasus, Russia, in its turn, can also expect to receive a great deal of attention from the European Union. I warmly applaud the fact that this subject has been so central to our discussions. Now that we have two points of contact, Mr Patten and Mr Solana, the EU can head an international campaign for the Caucasus. Mr Wiersma has already written a praiseworthy article on this in the Dutch press.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, let us as a European Union endeavour to encourage Russia to use other means to bring an end to the unrest that has been stirred up in its neighbouring countries due to the situation in Chechnya. In so doing, let us also recognise that Chechen leaders are not the most salubrious of types and do not represent a democratic constitutional state. But in any case, let us, as a European Union, embrace the Russian desire to secure multipolarity in the spirit in which it is intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to information from Moscow, the Red Cross is now, in anticipation of the winter, preparing new deliveries of aid for people in need throughout the Russian polar region. At the same time, the World Bank and the UNDP are talking of growing poverty, increasing social maladjustment and record youth unemployment in Russia. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that social destitution constitutes fertile ground for populists and extremists and for ethnic and religious conflicts is something we can see right now with appalling clarity in Chechnya and neighbouring regions where warlords and criminal clans are feathering their nests at the expense of the civilian population. There seems to be no end to the blood bath in Chechnya. Close on 200,000 innocent people have been forced to flee, and Dagestan is being ever more destabilised. It may be that our best intentions where Russia is concerned will in fact run into a lot of difficulties and be threatened by on-going crisis. In other words, “<span class="italic">our best laid schemes might go agley”</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">No-one within the EU is recommending an independent Chechnya. We cannot accept terrorist acts, but nor can we accept a military solution to this crisis. We demand that Russia initiate negotiations with Chechnya’s elected President without unrealistic prior conditions and that the aid which the EU has also promised should actually get through. </p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Prime Minister Putin got the Duma to approve an appropriation of a billion dollars for the war effort in Chechnya. My question to the Council and the Commission is this: will you see to it that Russian aggression in Chechnya is not partly financed from international sources? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Presumably, the Russian leaders also received some sort of promise regarding this when they were making their contribution to the peaceful dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. This has also been the West’s common position in its attitude to events in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian leadership, however, apparently fears it is losing those regions whose population is mainly made up of ethnic and religious minorities. Military withdrawal from Chechnya was seen as a dangerous precedent. The events of Dagestan gave cause to presume that the disease is spreading. The Russian leadership’s worry concerning their country’s regional unity is doubtless well-founded. They should, however, realise that a country’s sovereignty cannot be secured through military force. The only realistic way forward is for the minority peoples living in the southern parts of Russia to be satisfied with their circumstances and feel that belonging to the Russian Federation benefits them.</p>
<p class="contents">Military might is necessary, but it should be used only to keep terrorism under control. The West must clearly condemn the excessive use of military force in Chechnya – more clearly than what was the case at the Helsinki Summit meeting. We must influence the Russian government so that it would try to solve its country’s internal problems both through political means and by promoting economic and social development. EU and Western credibility and capacity for action generally is unfortunately made weaker in this matter by the recent war waged in Yugoslavia on humanitarian grounds.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Russia is in breach of many human rights agreements. For example, the European Council’s agreements strictly prohibit countries from murdering and bombing their own nationals. The OSCE agreements also demonstrated clearly that countries are committed to the notion that violations of human rights can never constitute the internal affairs of a state. In addition, Russia’s centralised power is oppressing a national minority. We might even suspect that ethnic cleansing is taking place there, with Russia trying to create Chechen-free buffer zones.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group’s position is that our wishes and cabinet discussions are not enough: financial aid for Russia should be restricted to humanitarian and environmental aid. My colleague, Mr Schori, gave an account just now of the latest information on how Russia is, in fact, strengthening its military budget.

Cooperation of this kind is presently threatened by the war in Chechnya and by other regional conflicts. I believe, however, that the war in Chechnya should not be seen either as a purely regional conflict or as a purely religious dispute. That would be to play down the situation and also to underestimate it. It is also quite clearly a question of geo-strategical manoeuvrings for access to the oil and gas reserves in the Caucasus and around the Caspian Sea. Here, European, American, Chinese, Russian and other economic interests collide. A small spark in this area can lead to an explosion. And, as of today, a new crisis has evolved, namely in Armenia.

In no circumstances is it acceptable. We wish to achieve a solution through dialogue, and that will require talks between the leaders of Russia and Chechnya. We will arrange for still closer dialogue between the EU and Russia. In these discussions we will express our frustration with the Russian action in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">As was pointed out in the discussions, it is clear that the continued crisis is increasing pressure to put Union cooperation with Russia on ice. If the situation does not improve, it will be even harder for the Council to counter this pressure. We have also noted the growth in the proportion of military expenditure in the Russian budget, and we have asked how Russia intends to finance this.

All of us in this House agree about that, and it has been said again and again through a multiplicity of decisions. Against this background, I naturally welcome the fact that the partnership agreement has now been translated into concrete fact, that there are regular consultations and that every possible question is being discussed and, in that way, positive results even achieved. I also welcome the fact that the new Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana, has declared that, from his point of view, policy towards Russia has first priority. It is certainly only right that that too should be the case. </p>
<p class="contents">So much for the good news. Now for the bad news. I do not want to conceal the fact – and I have in fact been involved with policy towards Russia for a number of years now – that there are aspects of it which are hugely frustrating. In connection with Russia, the same themes appear over and over again on the agenda, whatever the Committee concerned and irrespective of whether it is a question of the fight against crime, economic reforms or sensible legislation in Russia concerning, for example, banking or taxes. And nowhere can any effective progress be seen. That is frustrating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as apparent that, now as before, a large part of the flow of aid to Russia (I need only mention the letters IMF or International Monetary Fund) disappears into a bottomless pit. It is regrettable that we cannot achieve any real progress on this issue. Just as frustrating is what is happening at the moment in Chechnya and being conveyed to our television screens. I do not want to say anything more at all just now about the infringements of human rights because quite a lot has already been said about these at the last plenary part-session. They are alarming, and we must condemn them and address the issue. But I believe too that what is now being done in Russia to solve the problem is really no solution. Mr Putin may perhaps have some short-term successes in the area of domestic politics, but he will not in the end solve the problem of minorities within Russia and the problem of a certain necessary decolonisation. </p>
<p class="contents">The Russian government would be well advised to look at examples partly to be found in their own country – I mention only Tatarstan – and to try to find other political solutions instead of doing what they are doing at the moment where, in the end, any success will be outweighed by the damage done. This must be said because one must be honest with partners and also tell them the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I examine the Joint Declaration of the Summit on Chechnya – the most important matter at the moment in our cooperation with Russia – I see that it says that the European Union and the Russian Federation exchanged viewpoints about the situation in the North Caucasus. In fact, that really cannot be all there is to say. </p>
<p class="contents">Any cooperation with Russia is at present overshadowed by the war in Chechnya. There are already 180 000 refugees in Ingushetia and Dagestan. Aid organisations cannot work there. Thousands of refugees are no longer permitted to leave the country, and the Russian government is not prepared to talk. </p>
<p class="contents">We need a political solution. I am of the view that the European Union must attach more weight to discussions. We have an interest in cooperating with Russia. Naturally, we need Russia, for example in Kosovo. But Russia in turn needs us, that is to say it needs the European Union. I think that consideration might be given to whether, in negotiations, the following might be said: we must consider whether, if no political solution is sought and found in Chechnya, we ought in fact to block credits or cancel aid – other than forms of humanitarian aid – for Russia. </p>

<p class="contents">Throughout Europe, this summit has been a gigantic disappointment. Nor can there really be any beating about the bush as the Presidency has just done. In fact, the EU has failed downright and has not used the possibilities open to it. Why are we again accepting a brutal war by Russia against its own people? Why do we simply pass on to the existing agenda? That is really not what meetings at the highest level are there for. They are not there for the purpose of exchanging civilities. They are there for calling a spade a spade. I must say that the report by the Finnish Presidency is a mockery of the facts, however they are described. The truth is that villagers are being bombarded and refugees surrounded, and these are startling infringements of international laws. This is not just an internal matter for Russia that can simply be brushed aside. </p>
<p class="contents">We have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have the human rights clauses and, therefore, we have the opportunity to threaten economic sanctions and press for the bombardments to cease. Without this, no international aid can arrive there, Mr Patten; that is no doubt clear. I therefore expect the Presidency and the Commission to get together now and to develop a strategy in the framework of the Joint Foreign and Security Policy which threatens the use of these economic tools and compels Russia to end this war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was with great bravery that the Finnish people found their way to freedom, and I should therefore have expected the Finnish Presidency of the Council to show more understanding for the sufferings of the oppressed Chechen people. I must say quite clearly that the European Union’s strategy towards Russia has failed. Not only because the Russian State and economy are in a deeper crisis than they were just a few years ago; and not only because the present Russian leadership is already conducting its second brutal colonial war against Chechnya, which is about oil interests and which we are paying for. It is also the case that at present a particularly brutal form of election campaign is being developed. We are contributing to this bloody election campaign with summit meetings and with money which is being frittered away in this war. Without western money, Russia would in fact be unable to finance this war by no later than the end of the month. It is therefore we who are financing this murder of the civilian population in Chechnya. We must therefore get down to business here as well, and make it clear to the Russians that we are no longer prepared to do this. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to be quite clear in my opinion that the European Union must change its policy here, that it must come out unambiguously on the side of the Chechen people. For this, the OSCE, the Ceasefire Agreement of 1996 and also Russia’s membership of the Council of Europe can also offer levers, together with our Cooperation Agreement with Russia. We only have to use these tools and should not just say what the present Russian leadership wants to hear. Mr Putin, a secret service man who distinguished himself in the last war in Chechnya, has constantly been quoted today. It has been said – almost emotionally – that he does not plan to declare a state of emergency. Why not? Because his popularity since the beginning of the war in Chechnya has increased sevenfold. Why then is he not going to be holding any elections? In fact, he is already conducting an election campaign by means of this war, and only if his popularity were to decline would scenarios like that have to be reconsidered. That is why we need to change our tune quickly and find clear words in which to express our point of view.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Russian action there seems to be taking the form of actual persecution of the civil population. This is to be condemned once and for all, and this will lead to a situation before long in which we have to cease providing aid to Russia. The cessation of this aid will obviously affect the poorest and those who need help most, it has to be remembered.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking for a way out. Could we imagine a conference being organised for the whole Caucasus issue, as there are military operations going on there within the territories of at least five states, and not just in Chechnya, about which my colleagues have spoken? The example of Armenia – the murder of the Prime Minister a few hours ago today – is again a deplorable indication of that. The other possibility is that Russia turns the main weight of its attention from the south to the north, which is much richer in natural resources than the south, with no conflicts or dangers. This again would be one way of finding a way out of the difficulty. Is the Commissioner ready to support this sort of northern dimension action?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, Prime Minister Putin’s 2000 budget was approved but only because he has earmarked an additional billion dollars for the army in Chechnya, which means arms for Chechnya against the vote of the old Communists. With less than two months to go to the vote, Putin is not going to upset the Russian Parliament, which is against him, with proposals for a political solution instead of a military one. Putin, moreover, accepts the military aid, but says that it must be distributed by the Russians without international control – an absurd request given all the thieves and enemies around. Putin is pushing the war on for pre-electoral reasons and not because he fears Islam or any other even more foolish reasons. However, documents where a rational desire to cooperate with westerners is expressed are useful to him, such as the Helsinki document of 22 October. We know that a week ago the debate was very bitter, while the resulting document, loaded with clichés singing the praises of cooperation, obviously does not express the feeling of that debate and the Russians are taking advantage of it. I would also invite the Ministers not to use the term “terrorists” when referring to the Chechen guerrillas. Indeed, we have had to change our minds all too often, as in the end terrorists have become fighters for national rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that proper political dealings with Moscow will only be able to start again in January, after the elections, and maybe not even before August. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But there are, as Mr Paasilinna pointed out, grounds for concern about the situation in the South Caucasus as well. The honourable Member pointed to the alarming reports of the shooting in the Armenian parliament today and the reported assassination of the Prime Minister. We await confirmation of that tragic news, but it appears the news is probably accurate.</p>
<p class="contents">I saw the Armenian Foreign Minister recently to discuss his concerns about the stability of the Southern Caucasus and, as well, to hear some of the concerns that he was expressing about Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus. I should like to say on this occasion that the Commission wants to reiterate its support for the Armenian Government in its efforts to find a rapid and peaceful solution to the situation in the Caucasus. What has happened today is deeply troubling.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has focused on Chechnya, which was the subject of some very straight talking in Helsinki with some Members understandably asserting that the European Union should have done something more than it has done already. I think it is perhaps an inevitable consequence of a debate like that, that there was not absolute clarity on what it was that we should have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reiterate some points that were made earlier by the presidency. The communiqué, as the honourable Member pointed out, referred to the fact that we had exchanged views on the situation in the Northern Caucasus. The communiqué did not say any more than that for a very good reason: we could not put in the communiqué that we had agreed on anything regarding the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">What the European Union asserted strongly was: first of all, that whatever the concerns about Chechen terrorism – which are understandable – there is a powerful case for proportionality in dealing with that problem; secondly, we argued passionately for de-escalation and political dialogue. The problem, if you appear to undermine and destroy the authority of any moderate leaders in Chechnya, is this: who do you then talk to? Who do you then have a political dialogue with? That is a point that we put very strongly to Prime Minister Putin, both during the official discussions and over lunch when Chechnya completely dominated the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We argued very strongly for the aid assessment mission to be allowed into Ingushetia as rapidly as possible. I spoke last week to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance at the UN. I spoke last week to Mrs Ogata in the UNHCR. I read, as honourable Members will have done, the reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross on the humanitarian crisis which gets worse day by day in the Northern Caucasus. The ICRC suggested last week that over one third of the population of Grozny had left already. So we pressed the Russians to recognise that there must be an early visit by aid organisations to the region so we know what the situation is and how we can best contribute to the humanitarian problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the honourable Member who suggested that we should perhaps consider cutting off any humanitarian assistance will have second thoughts about that. I have been a development minister providing humanitarian assistance on a national basis to countries torn apart by war. I have never believed that cutting off assistance to those who are affected by war, who are affected by the political decisions taken by their rulers, was a very good way of responding to crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just add a word about the funding of the military campaign which, in my judgement – not a judgement which appears to be supported by the Russian Prime Minister – is bound to have an effect on the recovery over the last months of the Russian economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members suggested that we should cut off financial assistance to the Russian Federation because that assistance might be used to sustain the military campaign. I should just like to remind Members of Parliament, who are probably more familiar with some of the details of these issues than even I am, that we are not the provider of direct financial assistance to the Russian authorities. That is not how Tacis works. We are not an international financial institution providing financial assistance for the reconstruction – we hope – of the Russian economy. People should be clear that what we are doing is not sustaining Russian military campaigns in Chechnya or anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">But when you start talking about cutting off programmes of assistance to Russia you have to face up to some of the consequences. An issue about which I feel passionately is the successful negotiation of the multilateral nuclear environment programme, the attempt to ensure that Western donors can provide technical and financial assistance for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste in north-west Russia, including all those terrifying, rusting nuclear submarines and the other nuclear garbage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for all of us that we make a programme like that succeed. I hope we can push on with talks about programmes like that even while we talk firmly and strongly to the Russians about the tragedy in the Northern Caucasus in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that we made to Russian officials, to the Prime Minister, was that we were talking strongly on these issues, not as enemies but as people who wanted a cooperative relationship with Russia. We were talking strongly because we were reflecting the opinions of our public in the European Union: the sort of opinions reflected in speech after speech in this Chamber today.</p>
<p class="contents">So what this debate has done is to underline the argument that we were putting to Mr Putin and others. It is an argument which I hope they will take very seriously over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a return to negotiation, difficult though that may seem to Russian leaders. There must be a return to negotiation otherwise I fear that we will see disaster loaded upon disaster. In those circumstances I do not think that anyone’s opinion poll ratings are going to hold up for very long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
