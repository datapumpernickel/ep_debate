<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busk (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Maat of the Group of the European People’s Party and Mr Kindermann of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for what was unusually constructive and fruitful cooperation in the Committee. There was, of course, overwhelming interest in this report, such that no less than 135 amendments were tabled. We jointly made these into 10 compromise amendments adopted by a very large majority of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I should also like to thank the Commission and the Swedish Presidency for their very constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal, which forms the basis for the measures concerned, contains many good features, but I do not think that it is sufficiently far-reaching. What I do not see are common rules for European farmers competing in a single internal market. Animal welfare and the needs of pigs are of course one and the same, whether the pigs concerned are in the north or the south. Naturally, there are differences in temperature, but that only, of course, increases the need for overhead sprays, for harmonised rules concerning ventilation and for very good training for all EU farmers. I also think we are obliged to adopt common rules for European farmers and that we must not only ever talk about minimum rules. That is also, of course, what the Commission has proposed. It is clear to everyone that the different Member States do not attach equal importance to animal welfare, and it is therefore necessary for ourselves here in Parliament, together with the Commission, to decide that these concerns should be raised jointly. Otherwise, it will be possible justly to accuse us of not complying with our own decisions. The fact that we in Europe make high demands in terms of animal welfare makes our European pig breeders less competitive than producers outside the EU. In order to meet this problem and in order to ensure that consumers have clear and lucid information about products that witness to a high standard of animal welfare, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would request the Commission to take initiatives to produce common rules for the labelling of pork that complies with these high standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of sympathy for the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy about introducing an import ban on products from third countries which do not comply with those standards we require. However, that is, of course, the same as proposing, or supporting the idea of, a trade war, and that is something I do not think we should do. It is therefore a problem that the Commission should solve under the aegis of the WTO. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would also ask the Commission to prepare a report on the situation regarding implementation of the existing directives from 1991, for it is of course not only a question of fair competition in the world market but also, to a large extent, of fair competition in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States send information about the directive to the Commission, but we are not given this information here in Parliament. The Commission ought now to gather the information and present it in a report explaining how the directive has been implemented, just as, this afternoon, we heard Commissioner Byrne provide a clear explanation of progress where animal transport is concerned. It could well be that the Commission appreciates the need for common rules, such as those within the transport area. I am very much looking forward to the Commission’s relevant proposals, which we expect to receive in October of this year. It is now, therefore, the Commission’s task to look after the interests of European farmers in the forthcoming WTO negotiations. As has been said, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes partly solving this problem by introducing a common welfare-marking system. It is, of course, obvious that every time European pig producers have a cost imposed upon them, it is not imposed upon our competitors, then we may be in danger of losing market shares.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also wants the Commission to propose rules for keeping pigs outdoors, now that the rules governing intensive pig rearing are soon to be in place. We also have a duty to have definite rules adopted governing other pigs. More and more pigs are kept outdoors, and it is therefore necessary to secure common rules governing access to mud baths and shade and any other facilities relevant to keeping pigs outdoors. We have also tightened up the rules on training. It ought quite simply to be a requirement for farmers to have practical and theoretical training so that they are able to look after their animals responsibly. Like the introduction of overhead sprays, this tightening-up of the rules provides for animals’ greater welfare, and these matters are very, very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has managed to incorporate most of the legislation that went through the Committee on the Environment, which is important. It is also important that we push this legislation forward so that the consumers can have a product which they know is perfectly safe, is reared in an environmentally-friendly manner and which they can eat with total safety, knowing that the animal has had an excellent life. It is up to farmers to follow the legislation through.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Busk touched on two or three important issues. I will reiterate them very quickly. One of them was transport of animals. We are well aware of the importance of that and I know Commissioner Byrne, is equally aware of it. Bringing that legislation into the WTO negotiations is vitally important, as is clear labelling. Let me add, speaking not just from the viewpoint of the Committee on the Environment but also as farmer, that what we must not do within the European Union – and here I plead with the Commissioner, knowing his views on the way we import and export our products – is to end up putting legislation in place which exports the very industries on which we are legislating now in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do that, then we simply end up exporting animal welfare outside the European Union where we have no control over it. We must have equality, not just within the European Union, but also for products coming into the European Union. I plead with the Commissioner to make sure that sort of legislation is in place, so that we do not have products coming into the European Union which are not of the same standard that we set. I know it is very difficult for people to understand this, but I hope that the Commissioner will follow it through and keep that legislation in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mr Kindermann, who helped us find a solution in a number of compromise amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the Commission. I should like to thank Mr Byrne for coming up with a proposal at any rate. But at the same time, I am of the opinion that the Council should also be here today. For if we consider this legislation on the welfare of pigs, I cannot help but observe that the discrepancies between the European Member States are unjustifiably huge, so huge that they are posing a threat to our free internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, unacceptable in this Europe that, as a result, prices can differ between the various pig holdings in Europe by up to 30 to 35%. This situation is, at the same time, a criticism of the Council, which is requested to draft general rules. In actual fact – that is why I am so pleased with Mr Byrne’s presence here this evening – this matter is also of relevance to consumers, for we are once again debating a directive which has implications for farmers. But what about the implications for consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I should like to expressly underline that we are particularly concerned about this aspect for, in the final analysis, this proposal will lead to extra investments for pig holdings without any guarantee of an increase in yield. This concern must be reflected in whatever approach is adopted, be it via a European premium policy or an extra surcharge for consumers. In any case, animal welfare may no longer lead to huge differences in terms of competition, and the bill may not always have to be paid by European farmers alone. I wanted to make this quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not elaborate on the content of the report. Mr Busk made an excellent job of that. Mr Sturdy expertly outlined the consequences for the WTO negotiations. We all know that animal welfare is an incredibly difficult issue in the WTO. But if European society cares about animal welfare, it also has the costly duty to ensure that it is put on the agenda in the WTO negotiations, and to take this matter into consideration in politics in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We could talk about this topic <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>. We have been approached by various organisations with different points of view, as well as by consumer organisations, animal protection organisations and farmers’ organisations. I have increasingly noticed that, sometimes, there is definitely a basis for an alliance. But such an alliance could only be set up if the necessary funding started to become available and if the consumer were far more involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group welcomes the agreement reached, it is very concerned about the implications for farmers. We also believe that, slowly but surely, the implications for consumers should be made clearer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my group, I should like to thank both him and Mr Maat for their work. I think that the compromise proposals negotiated will bring us another step forward in improving how pigs are kept. But it is and remains just a compromise. Optimum demands, often couched in emotional terms, are self-evident but cannot be implemented as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, every new legal framework has a huge impact on the people affected. It is important here for us to have flexible transition times. Adjusting to other or new animal husbandry systems takes time and, more importantly, costs money. The conditions of competition are particular harsh in the pig production sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to address another two points: first, extra space for fattening pigs and, secondly, castration. Neither is covered by the Commission proposal but I think that the European Parliament should set higher standards for the protection of animals here. The 1997 Scientific Veterinary Committee report on the welfare of pigs gives us a starting point here, especially for the space which fattening pigs require.</p>
<p class="contents">We would not be able to get the general ban on the castration of pigs which some people are calling for across to German consumers in my view. Whether or not double vaccination of males can replace castration only time will tell. But I think this is the most practical solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the timetable is concerned, I think we have found an acceptable compromise. Holdings will have time to change their production methods over a fairly long period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the House to adopt the report as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We received a poor quality, inadequate document and considered whether we should return it to sender and ask for a reasonable proposal on the protection of pigs. But it must be said, Mr Busk, that you deserve our warmest congratulations on your work. That includes Mr Maat and Mr Kindermann, who helped with the compromise amendments. Now we have a proper proposal and, once again, Parliament has done a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a good thing that we intend to adopt it now because, had we decided otherwise and rejected the proposal, animal protection associations would again have accused farmers of wanting to stonewall, of wanting to put commercial interests first. But that was never our intention; we want to implement animal protection, obviously in tandem with farmers' commercial interests. As Mr Sturdy just said, we obviously need to ensure that the standards which we set at home also apply to products imported into the European Union. In this sense, we have to work towards reasonable external protection which adopts a qualified version of what we describe here as the European way in agriculture and have again implemented in such detail here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally consider that it is high time we got the debate on animal protection back on track. The debate on animal protection has thrown up highly exaggerated demands recently, in the wake of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises and with regard to the quality of food, which are totally unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I all too rarely hear any serious debate with qualified specialists. Too often hysteria gets the upper hand and hits the headlines. I will not beat about the bush: animals are animals and people are people. We keep animals in order to make use of them and if we want animal husbandry which is suited to the species, then it must indeed be suited to the species. This means, for example, that animals such as chickens, pigs or fish are not being kept in a way which is suited to their species if we try to apply humane or ethical concepts to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I know full well that agriculture is a difficult area, especially with the work it has to do and the problems that it has, and especially for those who are not directly affected. That is why it is all the more important for us to be able to make an informed judgement and to apply that judgement so that everything we decide here can be implemented and applied in practice. We cannot issue policy from an ivory tower and we have failed in our duty if our policy is not reflected in practical measures for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the report. I can support the compromises found with all my heart because the minimum requirements set here pose no problems for Austrian agriculture or Austrian farmers. Economic and ecological aspects need to be taken into account in the debate. The geographical location of the farm also plays a part, as do structural requirements. Development funds must be channelled to this sector because there is huge potential for investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that specialist training for stockmen and other people involved is absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is a real pity that animal protection directives are being issued rather than regulations. I say this as an enthusiastic supporter of regulations because, when directives are implemented, they generally bring new distortions of competition in their wake in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to address all the individual compromise amendments proposed here because a great deal of what we have set out here is, in my view, glaringly self-evident. To cite just one example: training for qualifications is recommended, but young farmers in Germany gave up trying to survive in this fiercely competitive sector without qualifications a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a great pity that the Commissioner does not have much time to listen but I shall address the controversial interests of consumer organisations once again, given that they are wheeled out in every debate and everyone keeps saying that consumers are calling for better protection for animals. Just by chance, I received Commissioner Fischler's press communiqué yesterday in which he said during an interview with a German broadsheet that consumer habits have now reversed post BSE. According to Commissioner Fischler, people are increasingly turning to cheap supplies once more. My many years' experience confirms precisely that. People obviously have to watch their budget and we need to be sensitive here and not overstep the mark. Everything we do has a very decisive impact on costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths. We almost make out that we are experts here. I think others are far better placed to judge. Mr President, I think that you know everything there is to know about pig production in Bavaria. You know what it means when we talk about docking tails, castration, teeth clipping and all these important things.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that we need to strike a balance between animal protection, health and environmental aspects. We also need acceptable transition times for the whole business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am probably the only speaker from a southern country, which, moreover, is the largest producer of pigs in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I want all the standards to be as uniform as possible in the whole of the European Union, but we need to harmonise standards that can be applied from Lapland to Andalusia, and after that, each country or each region can set the levels as high as it likes. What is neither fair nor contributes to European integration is trying to rigidly impose the standards, customs or traditions of one country on the rest, or trying to level standards upwards, because this makes us think, on the contrary, of obstacles to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The circumstances surrounding breeding and agricultural activities are very different between the north and south of the European Union, because the temperatures, the hours of sunlight, the species that are bred, the technological situation of the sectors, etc. are all different. And, as it says in Amendment No 7, and I quote, "the scientific justification for laying down new conditions is based on the situations obtaining in the northern European countries". Indeed, it has not been taken into account that there is not a sufficient supply of materials such as straw in hot countries, because it ferments with the heat and causes infections, nor that the slatted systems for facilities in southern countries act as a regulator.</p>
<p class="contents">It is asked that irrigation systems be installed to regulate the body temperature of the pigs, but nothing is said about installing heating in cold areas. Anyway, it has been shown that in northern countries many more piglets die than in hot countries, simply because it is cold and the piglets cuddle up to the mothers and the mothers squash them.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is anything said about the health aspect of the animals. And, with regard to the managers and workers on farms, I can assure you that, at least in my country, they are true professionals and take responsibility for training themselves, because therein lies the future of their farm. I think that it is ridiculous to require in a directive that they study and have a qualification in order to do their job.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish, Mr President, by saying that Spain has many reservations on the proposal from the Swedish Presidency on the system for maintaining sows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that we are reforming animal protection at European level. It would, of course, have been better, in order to safeguard equal conditions of competition within the Community, if we were to issue regulations, which are directly applicable and valid in the Member States, rather than animal protection directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare must form part of our basic ethical philosophy. However, this philosophy should not stop short at the borders of the EU. Similar demands must be introduced in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and this, Commissioner, is a leitmotiv running through this evening's debate. We must be aware of the fact that high animal protection standards in the EU lead to higher production costs. Our pig breeders then have to complete with imports from third countries which do not apply these animal protection standards and can therefore offer much lower prices. That is the fact of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">New animal protection standards also mean changes in farming systems. Farming systems set up recently in accordance with the relevant legislative specifications are to be given a transitional period in which to adapt. As far new investments in holdings are concerned, I agree with the proposal that the new specifications should be implemented by 2003. With a binding, cross-border ban on the castration of pigs, pig breeders and the market could, in my view, adapt perfectly well to the resultant changes. But we now call on the Commission to supplement the annex to the directive by 2002, so that male pigs are only castrated by people who have the knowledge and are qualified to do so. Castration not performed correctly results in constant pain. Account must be taken of specific details on holdings, such as the size of pens and how pregnant sows are kept. In addition, account must be taken of the pigs' natural habits, so that the pigs can keep themselves constantly occupied with food and any other material in which to root.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is for sure: whatever efforts we make to improve how pigs are kept, consumer trends will confirm whether or not we have been successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only two days ago the Commission, together with the Council presidency, had the opportunity to set out its views and commitments in relation to animal welfare. I very much welcomed the broad support expressed by Parliament. I would also like to thank Mr Busk, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the support given to this specific issue of the welfare of pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">The intensification of pig farming in Europe over the past ten years has led to practices which cause unnecessary suffering and which are increasingly proving to be counterproductive. I took the advice of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare very seriously in preparing the Commission proposal to bring current legislation in line with the scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal prohibits the confinement of sows during most of their pregnancy to individual stalls which severely restrict their freedom of movement. The use of tethers for sows and gilts will be definitively forbidden.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also sets out rules to improve the living environment of pigs and piglets in general, setting requirements for living spaces, floor surfaces and proper feeding systems. I can accept Amendment No 13 because it improves the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Aware of the importance of the effects of stockmanship on the welfare of pigs, the Commission proposal introduced new requirements for the persons attending to the animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 28 and 30 build on this, calling for certified training for the personnel attending to the pigs, and therefore can be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if I share the aim of Amendments Nos 1 and 26, they are not acceptable because they request initiatives that the Commission is already taking. I would make specific reference to the fact that the Commission has proposals in place under a Commission directive, under the comitology procedure, in relation to tail docking, teeth clipping, castration, light requirements and teeth grinding. All of that will be dealt with under the issue of comitology. I should like to take the opportunity to draw Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's attention to that particular fact, as I know he likes to take an overall view of the legislation that comes before the House.</p>
<p class="contents">A second proposal for a Commission directive amending the technical annexes to Directive 91/630 has been discussed by the Standing Veterinary Committee during the past months. These technical amendments regulate noise levels and light access for the animals to food and materials for rooting, timing of weaning of piglets and floor surfaces; they also prohibit the worst type of routine mutilations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8, 27 and 33 cannot be accepted because they reduce the possibility for the Commission to take urgent action to adopt technical improvements for the welfare of the animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 38 because the definition of manipulable materials is already foreseen in the annex and will be discussed further in the Standing Veterinary Committee. Amendments Nos 2, 10 and 31 add new aspects to the Commission proposal and introduce further initiatives. These are welcome, as is Amendment No 5, that sets a date for the Commission report on further questions related to the welfare of pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">Further scientific elements are also necessary to establish new rules for the stocking densities applicable to pigs for fattening. It is for this reason that Amendment No 11 cannot be accepted. The Commission is already committed to further analyse the issue from the scientific and economic point of view and to take the necessary steps.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that animal welfare carries a price and the measures outlined in this proposal are no exception. In an industry as competitive as the pig-meat industry, where margins are extremely tight, even small price differentials can have important competitive implications. The Commission is not blind to these implications. The proposal is based on extensive consultations with experts from inside and outside the Commission that led the Commission to the conclusion that the additional costs are a price worth paying.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 36 and 37 are not acceptable because the delay proposed for the application of the new requirements to all holdings is too strict and would significantly raise the costs of conversion. Data available to the Commission show that the costs would be increased from EUR 0.006 per kilo for a pig carcass to EUR 0.02 if the conversion is carried out with a delay shorter than ten months. That is 3.3 times the cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 35 is unacceptable for legal reasons and because we have assessed the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3, 4, 31 and 34 suggest that EU initiatives be taken on animal welfare only after having considered the global dimension of the agricultural trade. These amendments cannot be accepted. I should recall that the Commission is already considering the global dimension of the trade in animals and animal products, including in relation to the World Trade Organisation that a number of you mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a common misconception that putting forward animal welfare issues in this context is a protectionist agenda. The Commission considers that we have a duty and a responsibility to press for recognition of these standards, both on purely ethical grounds in recognition of the need for the humane treatment of animals, and in recognition of the higher costs which these standards entail for producers and consumers in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">These are legitimate issues, which deserve to be discussed on the international stage. It is essential to share our knowledge of animal welfare with countries outside the European Union and to create a harmonised approach towards this issue. I am grateful for the constructive approach given to this dossier by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 5, 10, 25, 28 and 30 in full, and Amendments Nos 13 and 31 in part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
