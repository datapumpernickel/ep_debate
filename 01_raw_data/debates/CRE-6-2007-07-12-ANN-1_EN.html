</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>On 7 February 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy, now President of France, proposed establishing a Mediterranean Union comprising the countries of North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and the south of the EU. The proposal is based on four pillars: an intergovernmental forum similar to the Council of Europe, a collective security system, co-development policies and integrated police cooperation joined to a 'common police area'.</p>
<p>Given that the Mediterranean Union appears at a first glance to give priority to security issues and indicates a preference for intergovernmental mechanisms to the detriment of supranational mechanisms while the development of Euromediterranean relations requires a particular boost in the economic, social and human spheres, and needs, above all, to foster intercultural dialogue, how does the Commission think that this proposal could affect the implementation of the Barcelona Process which began in 1995? Does it endorse the need to continue to push ahead with the Barcelona Process, without abandoning the multilateral and multisectoral focus which currently exists as a result of the Association Agreements signed by the EU and Mediterranean third countries, and which has been accentuated by the launch of the work of the Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly? What consequences does the Commission think that the Mediterranean Union proposal could have for the Turkish negotiation process?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission shares the honourable Member's conviction regarding the crucial importance of our relations with the countries of the southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>There is a need to increase Europe's participation and influence in the region. The Commission is in favour of any initiative that is aimed at developing our relations with our southern partners. The Commission is, of course, willing to take part in any discussion on this matter with Parliament, France, the other Member States and the partner countries.</p>
<p>The Commission supports in principle any initiative aimed at making our relations with our Mediterranean neighbours one of Europe's main priorities, although it would stress the importance of preserving the achievements of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation (the Barcelona Process) and of the Neighbourhood Policy, which has built strong institutional relations between Europe and the Mediterranean and which addresses the crucial issues at stake such as, for example, political and economic reform, the management of migratory flows, energy networks, the cleaning up of the Mediterranean, and trade and investment as factors of integration and of development.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, a great deal has been done since 1995 with the ‘Barcelona’ Euro-Mediterranean Process and since 2004 in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Much remains to be done, however, to strengthen the EU’s relations with the Mediterranean countries and to support them in their political and economic transition.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Barcelona Process and the Neighbourhood Process, the European Union has in fact succeeded in launching important initiatives in all the key areas:</p>
<p>Immigration: increased cooperation in the area of migration (ministerial meetings in 2006 with Africa in Rabat and Tripoli, and shortly, the first Euro-Med meeting in November 2007 in Portugal);</p>
<p>Energy: integrated Euro-Med energy market (including gas networks);</p>
<p>Investment: implementation of an investment fund for the region, as part of the Neighbourhood Policy (EUR 700 million contribution from the Community budget for 2007-2013);</p>
<p>Environment: implementation of a clean-up programme for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that the momentum built up by the Neighbourhood Policy under the German Presidency will continue under the Portuguese Presidency, with special emphasis placed on the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is important that the achievements of the Barcelona Process and of the Neighbourhood Policy be preserved as global frameworks of cooperation that will provide us with substantial room for manoeuvre to develop specific relations with our partners. For example, in the Maghreb, in certain important areas such as the fight against terrorism, energy and water management, I am convinced that it would be very much in our partner countries’ interests to develop new joint mechanisms.</p>
<p>With regard to the accession negotiations with Turkey, the European Union has been negotiating with Turkey since 3 October 2005 on the basis of a unanimously adopted Framework of negotiations, which says very clearly that ‘the objective of the negotiations is accession’, even though the negotiations are an open process of which the outcome cannot be guaranteed in advance. The Commission regards any new initiative that is designed to help strengthen our relations with our Mediterranean partners and that covers Turkey as being complementary to the accession negotiation process under way.</p>
<p>Finally, it is vital that the entire Union be involved in projects that concern the Member States as a whole. Only the involvement – the political, financial and institutional involvement – of the Union will make it possible for these significant results to be achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0512"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Union (Commission and Member States) can be proud to be the largest contributor of external assistance with more than 55% of the world's official development assistance. The Commission alone manages a fifth of these European funds.</p>
<p>External assistance is a fundamental component of EU External Actions. It is used to support a wide range of external policies. The Commission's Annual Report 2007 on development policy and the implementation of external assistance in 2006<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was transmitted to the Parliament mid June 2007, gives a detailed presentation of recent policy and other developments.</p>
<p>Active in 160 countries, the Commission's external assistance aims at fighting poverty and promoting economic development, human rights and democracy, in line with the EU consensus on development.</p>
<p>Thanks to the simplification of its instruments and of its procedures, the Commission keeps on improving the flexibility and the efficiency of its external assistance to deliver better and faster aid worldwide. The new external assistance instruments, finalized in 2006, provide a simplified framework for delivering assistance financed from the General Budget during the period 2007 to 2013. Nine financing instruments have replaced the previous wide range of geographical and thematic regulations. Co-operation with countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific will, however continue to be funded primarily through the European Development Fund.</p>
<p>2006 was another record year for the European Community's external assistance, with commitments reaching €9.8 billion. The European Community is therefore on course to meet its part of the EU commitment to double its Official Development Assistance by 2015 in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. As regards budget execution, the Commission disbursed a total sum of €8.1 billion in 2006, up from €7.5 billion in 2005.</p>
<p>Africa was the main recipient of the European Community's external aid with €3.3 billion of actual payments.</p>
<p>In 2006, the European Neighbourhood Policy was further strengthened by the conclusion of three new Action Plans with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia as well as the finalisation of the Action Plans with Egypt and Lebanon. In addition, a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument was adopted. Following the adoption of its programming documents (Strategy Papers) covering the period 2007-2013 by the Commission in March 2007, the preparation of the Annual Action Programmes (AAPs) is proceeding as planned. The Commission expects to adopt these programmes and to make all the necessary budgetary commitments before the end of 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission tries to improve the effectiveness of its aid delivery by implementing the 2005 Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness. At the same time progress has been good in implementing our commitments in policy coherence for development, in line with the decisions taken in 2005 by the Commission and Member States regarding twelve policy areas including trade, migration, fisheries, and climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission expects improved donor coordination, especially within the EU between Member States and the Commission, to contribute to achieving the goals. Important in this respect is the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy, adopted by the Council in May 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission has also shown again its ability to respond effectively in crisis situations. Faced with the risk of a major avian influenza pandemic, the Commission provided in 2006 year a rapid response with a pledge of €80 million for aid and the co-organisation of a meeting in Beijing with the main actors concerned. In Palestine, the Commission has put in place with the World Bank a Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) to help improve the socio-economic conditions of the most fragile parts of the population. In total, the European Community support to the Palestinian people amounted to €339 million in 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission was also proactive in the crucial area of Human Rights, with no fewer than 13 EU Election Observation Missions in 2006 and the preparation of a revised European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. This reflects the EU's strong conviction that promoting respect for Human Rights is an indispensable part of our external assistance policies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) To attain the ambitious targets for greenhouse gas reduction and production of Renewable energy set by the European Council, review of Community policies are currently underway.</p>
<p>The central importance of EU-wide measures was explicitly acknowledged by the European Council.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently considering a combination of regulatory and market based incentives to increase the share of renewable energies in the European energy mix with the twin objectives of contributing to reducing greenhouse gases and improve Europe's security of energy supplies.</p>
<p>Two EU programmes are in place to directly support renewable energies. Firstly, the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme - 2 (IEE), within the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) includes € 316.35 Mio for the period 2007-2013 for action to promote new and renewable energy resources and their use. Secondly, the development of innovative approaches in the field of renewable energies is supported through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7). This is the European Union’s main instrument for funding research in Europe. On top of that, Structural Funds are also directed towards investments in renewable energies. Data based on 402 Draft Operational Programmes, of which 12 are decided, indicate that about € 3.8 billion will be allocated to renewable energy projects until 2013. € 3.3 billion more will be used for energy efficiency, co-generation and energy management. These Operational Programmes have to be adopted by Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has published new draft environmental State Aid Guidelines. These should allow the Member States to support the development of Renewable energy sources in a more effective way.</p>
<p>The National Action Plans for renewable energy are a key feature of the new architecture for the EU's renewable energy policy, as proposed in the Renewable Energy Roadmap<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is currently elaborating a proposal for putting this new architecture into legal practice.

<p>The Commission states that the free market in gas is hardly operating, if at all, in Belgium (cf. SEC(2006)1709 and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0841">COM(2006)0841</a> final). This was recently confirmed by the announcement of a 13% to 20% rise in the price of the natural gas supplied by Electrabel. Despite the theoretical opening of the market, Electrabel still enjoys a de facto monopoly.</p>

<p>What national or European steps does the Commission consider feasible in the short term with the aim of averting the unjustified price rises?</p>

<p>(EN) The short term actions that the Commision can undertake are infringement procedures. There are ongoing infringement proceedings concern the application of Directives 2003/54/EC<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2003/55/EC<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The infringement procedures opened mainly concern problems related to the powers given to the federal energy regulator.</p>
<p>The Commission has issued a reasoned opinion and the next step foreseen is a referral to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>In general, energy pricing is a matter of Member State competence, but the Commission ensures that the level of prices does not distort competition.. In this context, the Commission may open infringement procedures and/or state aid cases, but this has so far not been the case for Belgium.</p>
<p>That said, it is an established fact that the Belgian market is highly concentrated and that Government measures have not yet produced all their effects.</p>
<p>The Commission will propose amendments to the legislative framework to facilitate the development of a genuinely competitive electricity and gas market. In parallel, the Commission will continue to ensure that the competition rules set out in Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty are respected by the operators, and in particular by the historic operators. In this context it should be noted that the Commission has an ongoing antitrust procedure concerning Distrigaz, the historic gas operator in Belgium, with a view to facilitating competition on the Belgian gas market.</p>
<p>The approval given by the Commission to the merger between Gaz de France and Suez is accompanied by very important remedies which will contribute to the development of a gas market in Belgium and France.</p>
<p>If the merger is not going ahead, any commitments entered into by the parties would no longer need to be implemented. In this case, the Commission would give careful consideration as to whether any further action would be needed for the development of the gas market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission presented in January 2007 a Road Map on renewable energy in electricity, heating and cooling and transport.</p>
<p>The European Council confirmed this path by agreeing on a binding 20% renewable energy target for the EU. This will be broken down to binding national targets for renewable energy (including a minimum 10% biofuels target). The Commission has estimated that wind energy could make up 12% of electricity consumption by 2020.</p>
<p>The Commission aims to remove barriers to the integration of renewable energy sources into the European energy market, including the development and liberalisation of the internal electricity market. Member States will be called upon to ensure rapid, fair and simple authorisation procedures for renewable energy sources, including pre-planning mechanisms where regions and municipalities should assign suitable locations for the deployment of wind parks, for instance. The Commission is undertaking several actions for supporting better integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This includes the enforcement of grid codes, projects under Intelligent Energy Europe, and participation in the Wind Platform. In this context, particular attention will be paid to special requirements related to deployment of offshore wind energy, including cross-border grid connections. It will also foster better use of the Community's financial instruments, notably the structural and cohesion funds.</p>
<p>The proposed project to connect offshore wind power in Northern Europe is a key priority for the EU. The projects aims to facilitate the integration of offshore wind energy produced in the Baltic and North Seas in the continental grid. The Commission is presently seeking Parliament's views on its proposed nomination for a European coordinator. In addition to his duties as project facilitator, the coordinator will also support the Commission in establishing future priorities in the framework of the TEN-E Programme with a particular emphasis to wind power connections.</p>
<p>The growth rate in installed wind power in the EU has been significant, reaching a total capacity of 48,000 MW by the end of 2006. The Commission will continue to encourage increased deployment of wind power through new research initiatives, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, but also existing Commission financing schemes, such as the 7th Framework programme for RTD, the Trans-European Networks for Energy, and the Intelligent Energy for Europe programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0498"></a>

<p>(EN) At the Spring 2007 European Council, agreement was reached on an energy policy for Europe.</p>
<p>The European Council decision followed on preparatory work initiated by the Commission, notably the March 2006 Green Paper "Secure, Competitive and Sustainable Energy for Europe",. The Parliament adopted its Resolution on 14 December 2006, and provided valuable basis for the further work, as did the broad public. In January 2007 the Commission presented the package on "Energy for a Changing World" including a Communication "An Energy Policy for Europe"<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The European Council conclusions recognise that the global energy world requires a European approach to ensure sustainable, secure and completive energy. The Action Plan endorsed by the European Council outlines a European approach: a well-functioning internal energy market; arrangements for solidarity in crises; clear goals and commitments on efficiency and renewables; frameworks for investment in technologies especially carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy; and finally focused external energy relations pursued with a strong, single voice.</p>
<p>The time horizon used in the preparatory work is 2030 and beyond. The modelling and scenarios analysis work of the Commission is available on the Commission's website. It provided a basis for assessing alternative options for the Action Plan.</p>

<p>(EN) The further development and implementation of an Energy Policy for Europe has certainly not been placed on the back burner. The Commission is currently working according to the very comprehensive mandate given by the European Council in March 2007.</p>
<p>The main topic for the European Council in June 2007 was the mandate for the Reform Treaty. This mandate includes the introduction of an Article specifically on Energy. This goes further than the draft energy text from the 2004 draft Constitution. It adds the promotion of interconnection of networks as an aim of the common energy policy and a reference to the spirit of solidarity. A similar reference to solidarity should be made in the existing Article 100 on security of supply, quoting the particular case of energy.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the June 2007 European Council underlined the importance of the Energy Policy, and gave further guidance for the future. This includes a paragraph (40) on the European Union's integrated climate and energy policy. The European Council recalls its conclusions of March 2007 and stresses the importance of implementing effectively and speedily all aspects of the comprehensive energy Action Plan with a view to taking forward the Energy Policy for Europe. In the chapter on EU-Africa relations, paragraph 50 welcomes the intention to establish an Africa-EU energy partnership.</p>
<p>It is for the European Council in spring 2008 to review the progress made by the Commission, Parliament and Council in the implementation of the Energy Policy for Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0449"></a>

<p>According to the Greek 'Eleftherotypia' newspaper, the Carlos Museum in Atlanta USA contains three stolen Greek antiquities, all obtained by illegal excavation.

<p>(EN) The goods referred to in the Honourable Member's question have been obtained from illegal excavation in a Member State. One of the most effective measures to address such illegal activities is to tackle the problem at its source by enforcement of the relevant national legislation.</p>
<p>As regards the authorisation of export of cultural goods from the Community, Council Regulation No 3911/92<a href="#defann_10_3" name="refann_10_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and Commission Regulation nNo 752/1993<a href="#defann_10_4" name="refann_10_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> establish a control system which is based on licences issued by the competent authorities and checked by the customs administrations of the Member States. It can, however, not be totally excluded that the established export control system is circumvented by criminal activities, particularly when goods are smuggled out of the Community. Preventing circumventions of this system is heavily dependent on the control measures taken by Member States.</p>
<p>To provide the necessary tools to improve general enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on the import and export of goods, the following initiatives, proposed by the Commission, have recently been developed:</p>
<p>The recent amendments to the Community Customs Code<a href="#defann_10_5" name="refann_10_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and its Implementing Provisions<a href="#defann_10_6" name="refann_10_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, have introduced a Common Risk Management Framework at Community level. New systems will be used to exchange risk-related information between Member States' customs authorities and with the Commission to further improve the targeting of customs controls.</p>
<p>The recent amendments to the Community customs legislation also foresee export declarations to be lodged in due time prior to departure. This will give the customs authorities of Member States the necessary time to carry out risk analysis and to select suspicious consignments for physical checks.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for amendment to Regulation nNo 515/97<a href="#defann_10_7" name="refann_10_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> is at present subject to the legislative procedure in the Parliament and the Council. The amendment will improve the Customs Information System, allow this system to be used for analytical purposes, allow for an automatic data exchange between Member States and for exchange of information with third countries and ensure the control of personal data. It is also suggested in this amendment to create a Customs Files Identification Database (FIDE) the aim of which shall be to enable the Commission and Member States' customs investigations services to identify the competent services of the other Member States which are investigating or have investigated on one or more persons or undertakings, for the purpose of assisting the prevention, the investigation and the prosecution of operations which are or have been in breach of community customs legislation, including Community legislation related to the export of cultural goods from the EU.</p>
<p>The "Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations" (Naples II Convention<a href="#defann_10_8" name="refann_10_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>), whose scope includes the prevention and detection of infringements to national customs provisions as well as to prosecute and punish infringements of Community and national provisions, provides an instrument for cooperation in the third pillar which is also applicable to Cultural Goods.</p>
<p>Regarding operational cooperation between the Member States' law enforcement agencies it is worth to note that the mandate of Europol also includes trafficking in cultural goods.</p>
<p>Council Directive 93/7/EEC <a href="#defann_10_9" name="refann_10_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>on the return of cultural goods provides for cooperation mechanisms and a procedure for returning national treasures when the cultural objects have left the territory of a Member State unlawfully and are in the territory of another Member State.</p>
<p>As regards cooperation mechanisms, the advisory Committee established under Article 8 of Council Regulation nNo 3911/92 and Article 17 of Council Directive 93/7/EEC adopted in 2001 guidelines for improving and strengthening administrative cooperation between the competent national authorities through the creation of a network of contacts and the exchange of information. They provide the institutions and persons concerned with useful information regarding the existence of Community instruments regulating the export of cultural objects to non-member countries and the return of objects which were unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State.</p>
<p>The second report on the application of Directive 93/7/EEC<a href="#defann_10_10" name="refann_10_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> concludes that there is a need for improvement in the cooperation and exchange of information between Member States. The Commission will examine how the guidelines on administrative cooperation can be improved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recognises that the EU's current energy and transport policies are not sustainable. The EU is committed to reducing greenhouse emissions, yet current energy and transport policies would mean EU CO2 emissions would increase by around 5% by 2030. Part of the challenge involves addressing the increase in road transport, especially the increase in the area of freight transport, and I am aware that the Commission is looking at various measures aimed at reducing our dependence on heavily-polluting fossil fuels and enhancing our energy efficiency. With food travelling ever greater distances to reach us and in light of the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuel in delivery from overseas, as compared to local delivery, what role does the Commission see for relocalising food supply as part of the solution, reducing food miles and thereby helping to tackle climate change?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission would begin by pointing out that the free movement of goods is one of the key components of the single market and, as such, makes a significant contribution to competitiveness and prosperity. Moreover, the common transport policy must not in any way distort the characteristics or transport patterns of transported goods, which are issues connected with freedom of trade and also, in this case, with the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is crucial for that policy to be supported by a sustainable form of mobility as proposed in the mid-term review of the European Commission's 2001 Transport White Paper and in the related EU strategies concerning climate change and the environment. Cleaner goods transport must also be encouraged, through technological and organisational innovation, not least to bring about 'green propulsion', the application of intelligent transport systems and the promotion of efficient transport logistics. A suitable policy on investment and access to markets must also be pursued to encourage optimum use of all modes of transport independently or in combination (co-modality). Above all, it is important to ensure that transport costs reflect the costs actually occasioned, including the adverse effects on the environment. The Commission is working to develop a methodology for the internalisation of external costs in the European Union, which will be ready in 2008.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the case in point, the Commission would emphasise that the majority of agricultural and food imports and exports are transported by sea, the environmental impact of which is generally less than with other modes of transport. Finally, it continues to be vitally important for developing countries - which bear only slight responsibility for climate change while suffering its consequences - to be able to export their products to Europe. This means that the issue of where our foodstuffs originate cannot be limited to a straightforward 'relocalisation' programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0458"></a>

In its annexes there are requirements for the use of secure parking spaces for certain substances and for all high consequence dangerous goods, namely those dangerous goods which are considered to be most attractive to terrorists. The annexes to the Directive are updated every two years and as part of that process the provisions on secure parking are continuously reviewed.</p>
<p>The provisions for the transport of dangerous goods are enforced under Directive 95/50/EC<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In amendments made to this Directive at the end of 2005 a new system of risk categories was introduced, this system identifies the infringement of the secure parking rules as a risk "category II infringement", an infringement which creates a risk of personal injury or damage to the environment. The allocation of the infringements to risk categories is also under review.</p>
<p>From a more general point of view, the Commission is aware of the need of adequate parking facilities for road transport. In this context, it launched on 12 June 2007 a Pilot Project to encourage investments in secure parking areas along the trans-European network to protect hauliers against freight crime and improve their working conditions.

<p>(EN) Food of animal origin may only be imported into the EU from a third country on condition that the country has submitted an annual plan setting out the guarantees which it offers as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in Annex I to Council Directive 96/23/EC. The guarantees must have an effect at least equivalent to those provided for in that Directive. If the plans are judged to offer equivalent guarantees, a recommendation is made to retain that country on the list of third countries with approved residues monitoring plans. The list of approved third countries is published by means of a Commission Decision which is voted on by Member State representatives through the comitology procedure.</p>
<p>In respect of beef and several other commodities, the Brazilian residue plan is approved and Brazil is listed in the above Decision. The entire Brazilian residues plan is much improved relative to that seen in either the 2003 or 2005 Food and Veterinary Office inspection missions on residues. For those commodities where the plan was not judged to offer equivalent guarantees, delisting was carried out by the Commission (e.g. honey, farmed game).</p>
<p>When consignments of food of animal origin are imported into the EU through Border Inspection Posts, EU Member States decide, on the basis of risk assessment whether the consignments are to be tested for residues of any pharmacologically active substance or environmental contaminant.</p>
<p>The Brazilian residues plan for cattle has been approved by the Commission and, in respect of growth promoting compounds such as hormones and beta agonists, covers all of the substance groups listed in Council Directive 96/23/EC. Like Member States, Brazil publishes its results annually. Over the last three years there have been no residues of beta-agonists detected. Residues of zeranol – a hormone-like substance have been detected in approximately 0.1% of the cattle sampled in 2006 and 2005. Other than deliberate (illegal) use, residues of this substance can also occur due to contamination of animal feeding stuffs and this phenomenon has been reported world-wide, including in the Member States.</p>
<p>Member States report the results of residues testing of imported food of animal origin to the Commission services. In the event of a non-compliant result, the Member State would be obliged to notify the Commission and the other Member States via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).</p>
<p>In respect of Brazilian beef, the last RASFF notification for residues of either hormones or beta-agonists was in the year 2001, when the beta-agonist clembuterol was detected in a consignment of corned beef exported to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2006 to 25 June 2007, 274 consignments of Brazilian beef have been sampled by the Member States and tested for a variety of residues of veterinary medicines and contaminants including 57 for residues of hormonal substances. Member States have not reported any non-compliant results through the RASFF notification system.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission can assure the Honourable Member that from a medicines and residues perspective, the importation of Brazilian beef does not breach the high sanitary standards that the European consumer is entitled to.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0465"></a>

<p>(EN) The labelling of lamb products sold to the final consumer is ruled by the general food labelling Directive 2000/13/EC. According to those rules, the origin of the lamb has to be labelled only where failure to give such indication might mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to EU rules, origin labelling is not compulsory for lamb products, as long as the labelling or presentation of the lamb product do not contain information that could mislead consumer, such as a picture or a flag suggesting a wrong idea on the true origin.</p>
<p>The very same food hygiene rules apply regardless of the origin of the lamb placed on the market within the EU. Also for food safety reasons, the traceability required by the General Food Law guarantees that the origin of the lamb is known throughout the whole food chain.</p>
<p>While the information on foodstuffs sold to the final consumer and to restaurants is regulated by European legislation, notably by Directive 2000/13/EC, the information provided to customers in restaurants is not.</p>
<p>However, the restaurant owner and personnel have all the information at their disposal and can share it with their customers upon request. Bearing also in mind that restaurants buy the raw material often on a day by day basis, strict regulatory requirements in that context do not seem appropriate.</p>

<p>(EN) Due to the lack of an explicit EU competence for sport in the Treaties, the Commission's role in the fight against doping has so far remained limited.</p>
<p>However, at the Commission’s request, an opinion on doping in sport was issued on 11 November 1999 by the European Group on Ethics. Shortly afterwards, on 1 December 1999, a Community support plan, which was given a favourable reception by Parliament, was adopted. This plan made it possible, among other things, to co-finance 16 pilot projects in 2000-2001 and 16 more in 2001-2002. The total amount of funding was € 7 360 212. Of the more important projects, mention should be made of the first transnational study devoted to doping practices in body-building premises in Europe, whose publication struck a cord in many quarters. An external evaluation of the first 16 pilot projects has been carried out and sent to Parliament. In addition, in 2004, a project aiming at harmonizing international knowledge of biomedical side effects of doping and supplementing and disseminating developed materials about health side effects of doping and drug abuse with regard to different age-groups, the addictive potential and gender specific differences, has been co-funded in the framework of the Public Health Programme 2003-2008. It is lasting for 36 months.</p>
<p>The Commission has also taken an active part in the establishment of the new World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p>
<p>Recently, Member State Sport Ministers, meeting in Stuttgart in March 2007, decided to launch a network of national anti-doping organisations of Member States. While respecting the intergovernmental nature of this work and the role played by the Member States, the Commission has assisted the German Presidency in setting up this network, including a kick-off meeting in Brussels on 25 June 2007. The network will focus its work on cooperation and exchange of information in areas such as law, medicine, testing procedures, research, education and prevention.</p>
<p>Generaly speaking, the Commission recognises that doping poses a threat to sport worldwide, including European sports, undermining the principle of open and fair competition. It also poses a serious threat to individual health, and there is a need to link law-enforcement and health prevention efforts.</p>
<p>These ideas will be reflected in the planned White Paper on Sport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0473"></a>

<p>(FR) On the basis of the initial check conducted, there would seem to have been no cases, in the last 12 months, of any infringement of Community law having been placed on the agenda of a session of the Council of Ministers following a formal request.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is also true that general discussions can spontaneously arise within the Council on other occasions - e.g. when the annual report on the implementation of a certain programme or action plan is presented. Over the last 12 months, this has happened, for instance, in the following cases:</p>
<p>at several meetings of the Competitiveness Council in 2006-2007, Member States were encouraged to cooperate with the Commission and strive on their side to ensure that the aims of the Better Regulation agenda, which include correct application of Community law, are achieved;</p>
<p>implementation is sometimes presented in the Council of Ministers as a topic for information or discussion in connection with the Internal Market Scoreboard - i.e. twice a year. At the Competitiveness Council in February 2007, the Council decided on the basis of the good results achieved by Member States in December 2006, to lower the target transposition deficit from 1,5% to 1% by 2009.</p>
<p>By way of information, another imminent case in point might be the following:</p>

<p>(EN) The question of the Honourable Member raises the issue of initiatives undertaken by the Commission to support immigrant communities, namely Somali ones, in the EU. The initiatives of the Commission do not focus on specific communities. However, all immigrant communities can benefit, and are encouraged to do so, from policy and financial support in the area of integration of third-country nationals.</p>
<p>Any policy efforts, in order to be successful, must be underpinned by adequate financial resources. Since 2003, the Commission has been co-financing trans-national integration projects which promote cooperation between Member States, regional/local authorities and other stakeholders under INTI<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Preparatory Actions. In the framework program Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows (2007-2013), the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals will support the integration challenges that Europe is facing. The Fund aims at creating a new form of solidarity in order to support the efforts of Member States in enabling third-country nationals of different cultural, religious, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds to settle and take actively part in all aspects of European societies. The Fund will support the development of national integration strategies and action plans which take into account the CBPs<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the coordination of national integration policies and the promotion of structural exchange of experiences, best practices and information on integration (€ 825 million for 2007-2013).</p>
<p>Regarding in particular the integration of those third-country nationals who have been recognized by Member States as in need of international protection and who have been subsequently granted a protection status (refugee or subsidiary protection status), there are specific EU instruments which regulate and promote it, including through financial support. More specifically, Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection (the "Qualification Directive") imposes specific obligations on Member States to make provisions for appropriate integration programs and to create pre-conditions which guarantee the access to such programs for these categories of third-country nationals. Moreover, the European Refugee Fund, which is in place since 2000, has been providing comprehensive and well-targeted financial support to the efforts by Member States to establish and operate integration programs for these groups, as well as to the efforts by all other stakeholders to carry out relevant transnational actions or other integration actions of interest to the Community as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Community Strategic Guidelines on Cohesion (CSG) adopted by the Council on 6 October 2006<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, underline the importance of urban centres as contributors to growth and more and better jobs. In this respect they call, among other things, for actions to promote a more balanced, polycentric development, by developing the urban network at national and Community level, and for making strategic choices in identifying and strengthening growth poles and their contribution to the promotion of the Lisbon Strategy. The CSG refer in this context to urban areas with over 50,000 inhabitants and to their potential in terms of entrepreneurship, innovation, research and technological development, and employability, fields that are in full agreement with the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Employment and constitute the corner stone of the revised Lisbon Strategy. From this it follows that, even if the CSG do not refer to specific numbers of growth poles, the areas that should qualify as such, are necessarily limited because of the development potential they have to demonstrate.</p>
<p>The National Strategic Reference Frameworks and Operational Programmes of almost all Member States consider it important to ensure the development of strong urban centres in order to spread growth and employment to a larger area as well as to the rural hinterland. Urban areas and regional centres are considered as conveyors of the regions' knowledge and skills excellence, promoters of competitiveness, development drivers and growth engines for the entire region in which the urban centre is located. The submitted programmes stress the importance of the links between such growth centres and their hinterland and surrounding rural areas. A substantial part of the planned Structural Funds' expenditure will be dedicated to improving competitiveness through promotion of innovation, and most of these investments will be realised in urban development centres.</p>
<p>The Greek National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) foresees that all main urban centres of Greece can function as development poles. In line with the priorities of the above mentioned Community Strategic Guidelines and in the framework of the application of the Lisbon Strategy, it provides a set of criteria for identifying such poles. As mentioned in the text of the Greek NSRF, the categorization which follows from the application of these criteria can be subject to review, depending on the future development of the areas concerned and their contribution to the promotion of the Lisbon Strategy. In any case, the Commission will strongly encourage that plans for development poles are the subject of a call for proposals, to be opened in the first half of 2008. Actors from all important urban centres in Greece can participate in this call.</p>
<p>While other areas may apply for assistance in favour of similar activities, the development pole concept is an instrument to promote, in a specific geographical area with the required characteristics, concentrated and coordinated interventions in particular in favour of innovation, research and technological development, knowledge transfer, information and communication technologies, and centres of excellence for education and training.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) It is the responsibility of Member States to decide on the structures for implementing European regional policy. The Commission ensures that these structures are consistent with the provisions of the regulatory framework. This is the case for Lithuania which, compared to the 2004-2006 period, has taken a number of steps to improve the regional allocation of funding.</p>
<p>In particular, the NSRF for 2007-2013 provides targeted support to n regional economic growth centres and problem territories by assisting in the economic, social and cultural development of these selected geographical areas.</p>
<p>Lithuania has also identified regional development as one of the four horizontal themes of the NSRF to ensure a comprehensive approach throughout the strategy, and has set as an objective that the gap between the level of development of the poorest regions and the Lithuanian average will not have increased by 2013.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages Members States to adhere to the partnership and the subsidiarity principles to ensure that the needs of regions and local territories are properly taken into account and that local authorities, as participants in the decision process, own the projects that are identified in the context of the development of these regional policies. These principles have been taken fully into account in the 2007-2013 NSRF and the respective Operational Programmes. Lithuania has improved substantially - with the creation of 11 working groups with 376 members - the participation of partners, regional and local authorities among others, in the NSRF preparation compared to the 2004-2006 programme. These authorities will be represented in the monitoring committees for the programmes allowing them to have full information on the progress and achievements of the relevant programmes.</p>
<p>The NSRF 2007-2013 foresees one Operational Programme specifically to deal with promoting cohesion. It aims to promote economic and social cohesion ensuring a similar living environment irrespective of the living place. The first priority targets the creation of the necessary preconditions for strengthening the potential of local development; the second priority aims to ensure accessible and high quality essential public services provided by healthcare, education and state employment promotion policy institutions; and the third priority aims to achieve better quality of environment with a focus on improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, the NSRF foresees greater involvement of the Regional Councils in the administration of the issues that fall under the competence of local authorities, issues that in the 2004-2006 Programme were managed at central administration level. Regional Councils will pre-select the investment projects and local authorities will be responsible for their implementation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0495"></a>

<p>Belgium and the Netherlands have different laws on offsetting costs of mortgage loans against taxation: for residents of Belgium, offsetting is limited (as regards both the amount and the period), whereas for residents of the Netherlands there is no limit on the offsetting of interest. Dutch banks offer residents of the Netherlands who take out mortgage loans (including for the purchase of property in Belgium) formulae which would be impossible in Belgium, such as interest-only mortgages. As real estate prices are much higher in the Netherlands than in Belgium, people from the Netherlands are happy to pay more than the market value for property near the border, which is often impossible for Belgians living on the same income because of the differences in the tax systems. This leads to over-valuation of property in the border region.</p>
<p>Does this constitute discrimination against Belgian tax-payers and in favour of Netherlands tax-payers?

<p>(EN) 1. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) came into force at the beginning of 2007, with the objective of supporting workers made redundant due to changes in world trade patterns. An amount of up to € 500 million can be made available each year. This amount is entered in a reserve in the budget and is mobilised following request by the Commission to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p>To date, the Commission has received three formal applications for an EGF contribution, two from France and one from Germany:</p>
<p>An application submitted on 9 March 2007 and completed on 11 May 2007, concerning over 1000 redundancies in subcontractors of Peugeot-Citroën (PSA). France has requested a contribution of €2.558.250 in order to assist 267 workers made redundant as a result of bankruptcy of their employer, a parts supplier to PSA.</p>
<p>An application submitted on 27 March 2007 and completed on 11 May 2007, concerning over 1000 redundancies in subcontractors of Renault (RSA). France has requested a contribution of €1.258.030 in order to assist 628 workers made redundant as a result of the bankruptcy of their employer, a parts supplier to RSA.</p>
<p>An application submitted on 27 June 2007, concerning redundancies in the German plants of the Taiwanese mobile phone manufacturer BenQ. Germany has requested a contribution of €14.266.155 in order to assist 3300 workers made redundant when Ben-Q stopped all financial support to its subsidiary companies in Germany.</p>
<p>The Commission has approved the first two proposals for submission to the budgetary authority on 25 June 2007. The third proposal is currently being analysed by the Commission.</p>
<p>2. The EGF intervenes when there have been over 1000 redundancies in an enterprise and its suppliers, or amongst several enterprises in a single industrial sector in one, or two, contiguous regions. Exceptions can be made for small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances, both of which must be justified by the applicant Member State. In order for the EGF to be mobilised, the Member State concerned must present an application, which inter alia clearly proves the link between the redundancies and the changes in world trade patterns.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0503"></a>

<p>(EN) As the question of the Honourable Member mentions, an external study in relation to proportionality between capital and control has recently been conducted for the Commission. The final report was published on the internet on 4 June 2007.<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>The study provides a useful factual background to the issue of proportionality between capital and control in listed companies. The scope of the study was broad, in order to take account of concerns expressed inter alia by the Nordic countries. Shares with multiple voting rights, but also other mechanisms such as voting caps, non-voting preferential shares, company pyramids, etc. were examined in the study.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently analysing the conclusions of the study. It appears that, on the basis of the academic research available, there is no conclusive evidence of a causal link between deviations from the proportionality principle between capital and control and either (1) the economic performance of listed companies or (2) their governance. However, some evidence suggests that investors perceive these mechanisms negatively and consider that more transparency would be helpful in making investment decisions.</p>
<p>This study is only one step in the process. It will provide input for an impact assessment that the Commission is currently carrying out. It is envisaged that this impact assessment will be published in autumn 2007. The impact assessment will fully take into account such key issues as contractual freedom in the context of special voting arrangements.</p>
<p>The Commission's research on the issue of proportionality between capital and control is still at the exploratory stage. Until the publication of the study mentioned above, the Commission didn't have a clear picture of how this issue affected European listed companies and whether it had an impact on their economic performance. Now that these facts are on the table, the Commission will examine, with an open mind and on the basis of all available information, whether there is a need for Commission action in this field and will decide how to proceed further. No decision on this issue has been taken yet and the possibility of not taking any action is also being considered.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The security reasons cited by employers for installing such systems are completely unsubstantiated as similar reasons also existed previously and numerous technical facilities are available for the protection and security of companies, without requiring the surveillance of workers.

This framework, as well as the national data protection laws implementing the Directive, fully applies to employees' personal data. This Directive is of a general nature and does not, in principle, contain employment sector specific provisions. Its provisions though are fully applicable to any type of automated or non-automated processing of personal data, among which is video-surveillance practices, e-access cards or processing of the employees' biometric data.</p>
<p>Any employer, in his/her capacity of data controller of his/her employees' personal data is subject to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC and has specific obligations accordingly, in particular the obligation to inform in an appropriate manner the data subjects, to notify the national supervisory authority of any processing of personal data and to act in compliance with the data protection principles provided in the Directive.</p>
<p>According to the above principles, personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully, collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and must be accurate and kept up to date (Article 6 of the Directive).</p>
<p>The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has issued a number of opinions and working documents concerning the application of the Community provisions to the processing of workers' personal data. The main document is the Opinion 8/2001 on the Processing of Personal Data in the Employment Context that deals exactly with the matter and in which one can find the main guidelines for the interpretation of the relevant general provisions of the Directive. Another relevant document is the Working Document on the Surveillance of Electronic Communications in the Workplace (WP 55) of 29 May 2002. In addition other documents of the WP29 concerning the protection of personal data in the sector of telecommunications, electronic communications and video surveillance provide guidelines that also apply to the processing of personal data in employment context.<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>

<p>While the sinking on 5 April 2007 of the cruise ship, the 'Sea Diamond', off the coast of Santorini continues to cause havoc to the marine environment in the region, the shipping company, Hellenic Louis Cruises, with the backing of the Ministry of Mercantile Marine, is refusing to pump out the crude oil, diesel, lubricants and other toxic liquids flowing from the ship's tanks into the marine environment. The measures taken by the competent Ministry of Mercantile Marine, which continues to impose fines on the shipping company, are ineffective because the marine environment of the island continues to be devastated. This deliberate stalling − an act of collusion between Hellenic Louis Cruises and the Ministry of Mercantile Marine − has provoked outrage among the inhabitants of Santorini at the environmental devastation of the area.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to help implement the proposals put forward by organisations on Santorini and in the wider region which call for the immediate emptying of the ship's tanks of oil, lubricants and toxic liquids, for the raising of the cruise ship, the 'Sea Diamond', and the restoration of the marine environment of the island?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Community civil protection mechanism was laid down by Decision No 2001/792/EC, Euratom. In the event that a Member State does not have sufficient capacities to cope with a disaster, it can request the help of the mechanism in order to obtain expertise or additional resources from the Member States participating in the mechanism.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) has been in contact with the Greek authorities and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in order to assess the consequences – particularly the environmental consequences – of the disaster caused by the sinking of the ‘Sea Diamond’.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Commission can provide the Member States with operational assistance to combat pollution caused by ships via the activities of EMSA, which has been active since 2004 and which has anti-pollution vessels, in particular, at its disposal. It is the responsibility of the Member State concerned, responsible for environmental protection, to call on the operational capacities of EMSA, if need be, via the Community civil protection mechanism.</p>
<p>In the case in point, Greece has not requested the assistance of the mechanism.</p>

<p>Romania's and Bulgaria's membership means that the EU now has borders with the Black Sea and that almost the entire course of the Danube has become an internal waterway.

<p>Under the Union's neighbourhood policy, the Commission has proposed the extension of the main European transport axes to the neighbouring countries. In view of the five transnational axes identified in 2005 by the High-Level Group and the proposed revision of the European transport projects in 2008, can the Commission indicate through which new transport projects (and related funds) the Union intends to take advantage of its access to the Black Sea, and which new priority European transport projects concern neighbourhood links with Moldova and Ukraine?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The trans-European transport networks (TEN-T), as revised by the Decision 2004/884, amended the list of priority projects with the particular aim of integrating the networks of the 12 new Member states. This list comprises 30 priority axes among which four ensure access to the Black Sea through road, rail, inlandwaterways and maritime connections.</p>
<p>The four priority projects are:</p>
<p>n<span class="sup">o</span> 7 Motorway axis Igoumenitsa/Patras-Athens-Sofia-Budapest which includes a branch to Constanta,</p>
<p>n<span class="sup">o</span> 18 Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube inland waterway axis,</p>
<p>n<span class="sup">o</span> 21 Motorways of the Sea of south-west Europe where a connection between the Black and Mediterranean Seas could be envisaged, and</p>
<p>n<span class="sup">o</span> 22 Railway axis Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nurnberg/Dresden which includes a branch to Costanta.</p>
<p>Projects on these four axes are eligible for co-financing from the TEN-T budget and in the case of Romania in particular from the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>Regarding connections between the EU and the neighbrouring countries, the Commission<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has endorsed the 5 trans-national axes proposed by the High Level Group. These 5fiveaxes are the most important for international trade at the Union level and carry already today considerable amounts of traffic.</p>
<p>Bilateral connections such as between Romania and Moldova were not part of this exercise but are covered under regional cooperation frameworks. The Community may contribute to support such co-operation frameworks using the approporiate financial mechanisms such as the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund for investments inside the EU and the Neighbourhood Investment Fund for investments inside countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy. To the Commission's knowledge, road rehabilitation works are already under way on the Moldovan side aiming at improving the connections with the TENs in Romania, with the support of the EBRD<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
