Not only have they suffered under conditions of war for years, resulting in numerous refugees, and occupation by neighbouring Rwanda, their plight has now also been compounded by volcanic eruptions. Recent tragic reports confirm the miserable situation the population is in. The short dry season has started and a blanket of heat has descended on the country. There is toxic dust, and toxic vapours are emerging from the lava. The population has no firewood and uses the heat of this lava stream for their cooking fires. You understand that this is a miserable situation involving a city which – at least in part – is reminiscent of Hiroshima in terms of destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The section of the city that was not affected by the eruption lives its normal life, insofar as this is possible under these circumstances and under the occupation. This means, therefore, that it is very difficult to distinguish the real victims from the others, and it is currently hard to tell who is suffering the most. This is a report which I have also found confirmed in a recent communication by the Bishops’ Conference which complains about the fact that the rations supplied are, in fact, insufficient, while the food supply is adequate; that a large section of the city has been razed to the ground but that it is hard to tell who are, in fact, the people who have really been hit. Surveys have been carried out, but the results of these are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, a stream of international aid has been set in motion, and the European Union has played a prominent role in this. I feared that, in my speech here, I would have to pass on a few complaints, for they are obviously brought to my attention. For example, I hear that all aid has to go via Kigali, and that the situation is being taken advantage of there. On the other hand, I have been told that Kigali airport is the most convenient in terms of freight handling, and that aid is no longer being hindered at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that aid has been supplied by the Democratic Republic of Congo to Bukavu and that it has to leave from there. However, that aid is labelled as aid from the Congolese population, and the occupying forces therefore do not allow the goods to be distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to put your minds at rest in a way, but the measures announced by the European Parliament are absolutely vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Organisational matters first: we hope that ECHO, the European Union with its aid, will no longer be hindered by anybody and will be able to get aid to the spot as quickly as possible. We also hope that this applies not only to the city of Goma, but also to the area surrounding it, including Bukavu, where there are also refugees, and Rwanda and Burundi too, where refugees are also scattered. We must give this aid, and quickly, to all those persons affected. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that this again throws the spotlight on the weakness of the organised state and on its absence in the Congo. The peace process needs to be firmly supported as soon as possible. We have to help the various parties to see reason as soon as possible in order to facilitate reconstruction in the Congo, so that administrative, and also democratic, structures may be restored and so that this great country's descent into chaos may be halted.</p>
<p class="contents">A great task is before us, and the exemplary aid we are currently able to provide is perhaps an incentive for the various participants in the conflict to listen to the European Community and avail themselves of our mediation.</p>

As you know, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in Goma, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is believed to be the most serious in central Africa for 25 years. I would firstly like to pay tribute to the people – numbering between 300 000 and 500 000 – who initially fled Goma, but who are now returning because they are committed to their hometown.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that this is a humanitarian and ecological disaster, which has occurred at a time when 80% of the farm workers had finished sowing their wheat and corn. We must bear in mind that it is the most fertile agricultural land that has been buried beneath lava, which has flattened houses and destroyed public buildings, particularly those housing NGOs. What is more, this tragedy has happened in a climate – as the previous speakers said – of violence and conflict in the Great Lakes region. As well as this tragedy, I think that we must now fear, because of the lack of clean drinking water, a spate of epidemics, cholera and dysentery in particular. We already know what this type of epidemic can lead to, particularly after the so-called ‘tropical’ genocide in which 50 000 people were killed in the same region of Goma. There has even been an explosion – we have seen pictures of it – in a petrol station. We have seen people looting and others leaving with jerry cans on their heads, going in search of petrol. I think that all this is also contributing to the climate of insecurity, which we must tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we can now welcome the fact that, as Mrs Maes said, the European Union has been quick to play a very active role on the ground, and that humanitarian aid has finally reached Goma, certain questions have, nevertheless, been raised and I think that we must try, along with the Commissioner, to provide an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in 1977, the same volcano began to erupt. It is deeply regrettable that houses were rebuilt on a volcano, whose embers were still so active. This was one of the questions raised in Goma, but I am raising it here because of all the other similar situations throughout the world. Houses are rebuilt in areas where similar disasters have already happened. Furthermore, I think that this tragedy must encourage everyone to respect the requirements drawn up for the ‘ten-year action against natural risks’ and that the European Union must play a greater role in this. Finally, we must seize this opportunity to compel all political forces, and particularly those that are at conflict, to guarantee that help is provided to displaced people and refugees. The Commission and the Member States must play a more active part in the international ten-year action that I mentioned. Lastly, since cooperation between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo is now being resumed, I think that we must push our partners to bring an end to conflict and to establish a fair and lasting peace. I think that, at the very least, these conditions are necessary if we want to stop the same conflict from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind – and this is my final point – that other disasters can happen; we know, for example, that Lake Kivu contains huge methane resources and that the lava which is flowing into these waters risks is causing many other problems as well. I thank the European Union for having taken swift action, but I would like to stress that we must step up our work and, through this, we can establish a fair and lasting peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first reality is the extreme poverty in which thousands of people live, not only in this eastern region, but in the whole of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a poverty which is aggravated all the more by the war which has been devastating that country since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Figures have been presented: it has been said that more than 300 000 people need assistance, that 30% of the population is homeless and that 12 000 homes need to be rebuilt. In this respect, the resolution we have approved this week, which establishes links between emergency aid, rehabilitation and the development policy, has been very timely.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reality is the hatred which has been brewing up between the people of the east and the neighbouring population of Rwanda, a hatred which has been demonstrated by the rejection by the people of Goma of the hospitality offered by Rwanda and the massive return of this population to their homes, which have now been taken over by the volcano, despite the risk of further eruptions.</p>
<p class="contents">These two realities should lead us to come up with a European Union strategy and action which involves us in this region. It is clear that a good reconstruction policy is required for Goma, as well as a policy on forecasting possible new eruptions and control of the Nyiragongo Volcano.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, none of this strategy will achieve effective results unless the foundations for a democratic system in the country are consolidated, as well as a broad social consensus which guarantees stability and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">But that will be of no use unless there is confidence in that stability throughout the region. It is therefore important that this inter-Congo dialogue which is restarting in South Africa in Sun City puts an end to this conflict. We also believe it is important to organise a regional conference which reconciles the countries of the Great Lakes region and brings back the confidence which has been lost to its various peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we are presenting is a collection of desires, principles and strategies which we wish to see applied in order to deal with the eruption of the Nyiragongo Volcano, without losing sight of what was said previously.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the global plan for 2000 managed by ECO and we ask that this plan, which is very important for the African region, and for the achievement of the objectives previously expressed, be speeded up and that this aid does not arrive late, which has unfortunately often been the case.</p>

That roughly means "one bad thing can easily lead to many others". I am afraid this is the case in Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Goma office of the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office was directly in the path of the lava flow. But a four-man team of ECHO experts, including disaster response and water specialists, was on the ground to assess needs within 36 hours of the eruption. ECHO Flight, the Commission's humanitarian air service based in Nairobi, has been made available, bringing in the United Nations Disaster Assessment Team, volcano experts and other key personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint assessments conducted by ECHO and the agencies on the ground resulted in the announcement of an emergency decision on Sunday, 20 January. EUR five million is covering the immediate needs of 100,000 people. That is about one-third of the affected population.</p>
<p class="contents">Operations are focusing on four main areas: water and health, shelter and non-food items, food, and coordination and logistics. The head of ECHO's Africa Unit visited the region from 30 January to 1 February. The mission confirmed that urgent needs were being met and that effective coordination was in place.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our next steps? First, the immediate emergency is now being managed by the agencies and resources already available. Further in-kind donations and the introduction of new agencies should be coordinated with the agencies already on the ground, to avoid potential duplication. After careful appraisal of the options, efforts should now begin to focus on balanced, medium-term assistance with resettlement of the homeless and the rehabilitation of essential social infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning Mr Sylla's main point, the high media profile of this disaster should not distract our attention from the scale of the humanitarian crisis caused by five years' conflict in Congo, already ECHO's biggest customer – EUR 32 million in 2002. The Commission would stress the need for an early and peaceful solution to the conflict through the implementation of the Lusaka Agreements and the Inter-Congolese Dialogue.</p>
