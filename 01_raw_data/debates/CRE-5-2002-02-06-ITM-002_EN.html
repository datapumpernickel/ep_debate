<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. – </span></span>  We come to the next item of business – and here I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents and colleagues in the House for taking a short policy statement from myself, followed by a debate, to talk a little bit about the next two and a half years of the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">When I spoke after my election on 15 January I said I would like to claim the privilege which is a common privilege of the newly elected President to address the House on our strategic purpose for the coming period. In deciding to speak today it was in deference to the fact that on the Wednesday of that part-session the Spanish Prime Minister was here to launch the Spanish presidency. One thing I want to bring to this House – and I hope we will all work on this together – is an ability to communicate who we are and what we do. So when you wish to communicate something you need to pick your moment and you cannot pick a moment which on that day belongs to someone else. Thus I am availing myself of the opportunity this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The great sense that I carry from the campaign which preceded my election as President is that there is an enormous appetite for change in our House. Despite that, it is a frustrated appetite in terms of the delivery of change. We need, through the different mechanisms – the Bureau, our committees, the Conference of Presidents – to convert that appetite for change into actual change on the floor of this House. My invitation to colleagues today is to seize this opportunity to create the change for which there is self-evidently such an appetite in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope in the next period before the election that we can be a reforming parliament in a visible way and that we can be a communicating parliament and a parliament that is prepared to take risk for change. This will require creativity and imagination on the part of everyone and together we can face that challenge. In effect what I should like to invite you to address in our debate today is a willingness to engage in creating a culture of transformation. It is now more than two decades since direct elections were introduced and we need to review how we do our business. We need to create a more vital and dynamic sense of parliamentarianism on the floor of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest transformation in hand of course is enlargement. The time has come for us, the political class, to repossess enlargement. It is inevitably the case that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> requires an enormous amount of work on the part of the European Commission and on the part of the public service in the candidate states to deal with all of the detail. But surrounding that detail is the wider political challenge – and that is our challenge. This House is uniquely well-placed to lead the politics of the transformation towards an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now entering the end game on the enlargement debate and we have the complex budgetary proposals which no doubt the House in due course will express itself on. It is important that the era for change which is enlargement should not be reduced to a budgetary debate about small change or large change, however one may perceive that to be. We have to take initiatives in this House to drive that agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I want this Parliament to be the place where the vitality of the enlargement debate plays itself out. Although the calendar is not yet firmly set, it seems to me that on two occasions this year we are likely to discuss enlargement, probably before the Seville summit at the end of the Spanish presidency and probably again in November.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you, especially in the political groups, to consider a formula where we can invite MPs from our political families from the candidate states to participate in our enlargement debates with us this year, to create a sense of vitality, to create a moment which is a very European moment, and to do it in terms which allow us to hear the different voices. They may be voices of accord or discord on some of the issues, but it is a really vital time and I hope the House will find within its mechanisms, and through the groups, a willingness to explore and create this platform, to express in a parliamentary sense this new Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Eventually, following from the example of German reunification more than a decade ago, I would hope that the House will agree that, when the candidate states sign the accession treaties that have yet to be ratified, we might consider budgeting and planning for full observer status so that we create the avant-garde for the new Europe and that we do it in this House because it is our public purpose to give real political leadership. Subject to these details and to getting agreement – because we need to work through it as regards budgets, we need to work through it in our Bureau, we need the agreement of the Conference of Presidents on our calendar – I should like in the coming months and before the Seville summit if I can, to visit every candidate state on behalf of this Parliament and to issue to them, to our parliamentary colleagues, the formal invitation to be the avant-garde for the new Europe and, if you allow it, it will be your invitation to them and my privilege to deliver it on your behalf.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the context of foreign policy and on a wider basis I hope in a number of ways that we can up our game. Europe needs a new foreign policy and I am certain in this House there is a majority and a will to create that foreign policy. In forming and developing strategic partnerships with the United States, with Russia, with a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, with a dialogue of civilisations, we are engaging in politics that are vital not just to the parliamentary process which is the image of the European Union itself. In this House we have great credibility in terms of our appetite to fight global poverty, disease and famine. In this House we have a wonderful and proud record in the promotion and defence of human rights. We must be determined to continue to play a leading role in this but we must find new platforms to express our leadership. It is not simply that we need to follow events but we ourselves, as a Parliament, have the capacity to create new platforms to offer a lead.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days and weeks, thanks to the work of so many colleagues in the House, we have begun to move towards a new and more mature form of political relations with other institutions and in particular with the European Commission. I congratulate Mrs Malmström in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, for the work which they have done in securing a landmark high-quality agreement on how we will go about the legislative process from now on. We need it and the work is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the House for the overwhelming vote of support yesterday for the report by Mr von Wogau which will allow us to adopt an effective interim solution – and it is only an interim solution – on the financial services reform pending, through the Convention, and through the Intergovernmental Conference, a new basis in the Treaty on which to conduct our institutional relations, on which to promote the role of a democratic Europe and on which to promote this Parliament's role in representing citizens in a vital way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular also to pay tribute, because these two reports have come through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the leadership role and qualities of Mr Napolitano whose work in this House has contributed so handsomely to these achievements.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The thread of consistency in all of these measures is the primacy of politics itself. That is our business. We also have to give a signal to the Commission, to the Council, to the wider world, that we in the European Parliament are mature and reliable partners in the project that we share in terms of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The counterpart is that I want to work now in the lead-up to the Barcelona European Council, with the Commission and with the Council, to get a meaningful interinstitutional working group. The primacy of politics comes to zero if the platforms to develop politics are not there. I say this to the Council: the time has now come for it, with the Commission and Parliament, to deliver that platform and to give us the ability to restore and to develop the primacy of politics, to prepare ourselves for common work on the Convention and for successful and common outcomes of substance in the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget also that we here in this House are a tribune of the peoples of Europe. Our essential public purpose is to serve our citizens. We can create and we can communicate a new pride in this Parliament. Our determination must be to accentuate the democratic over the technocratic, to insist on openness and to connect our message in every way we can with a wider European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very proud of the fact that it was on the floor of this Parliament that we, the parliamentarians, created, developed, explained and won the argument in favour of a Convention, in favour of a new way of creating the new Europe, in favour of an open and democratic and transparent way, in favour of trying to get in touch with a rising generation of Europeans who are untouched by business behind closed doors. The old permissive consent to allow the elite to proceed is no longer there in the old way and so we must earn the consent and respect of a rising generation. We can only do it through open methods and the Convention must be an open method and can be a very significant start.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament can claim an ownership of the idea. But we also have a key role as a stakeholder in this Convention. Our determination as Parliament is to promote the democratic Europe over the technocratic Europe and to insist on openness. In that regard, it is my view – and later today we have the possibility in the Conference of Presidents to meet the President of the Convention – that we must ensure as a Parliament that the Convention itself in its open work is the primary platform, is the main way, is the open discussion that leads to the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important – and we have distinguished colleagues on the praesidium to help to lead this debate – that this is a well-managed Convention. But its management must assist the Convention itself to be a real platform for open debate. I have asked the services here, in terms of connecting this debate to the wider public, to ensure that it is broadcast on a continuous basis on video-streaming, so that those who wish to follow – whether they are journalists, people working in research institutes, students in universities, different groups in the socio-economic sphere in Europe – but who are not in Brussels for its work, can do so on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, we still have a long way to go on the question of internal reform. I read the book <span class="italic">Mes combats </span>produced by my predecessor Nicole Fontaine. She spoke in it about the Members' Statute and about the virtual impossibility of making progress on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know what progress we can make but I express this hope today. I would like to bring closure to the Members' Statute. I want to work with the rapporteur, Mr Rothley; I want to work with key colleagues in the Bureau and the College of Quaestors. But firstly I want to talk to Members in this House to try to develop, mobilise and motivate a majority for change. Over the coming weeks, we will engage in an intensive round of consultation with Members. There will be no statute over the head of Members – I give you that guarantee. But there can be no statute without mobilising the majority – first in here. Then, of course, even if we do that, we still have to rely on the Council to deliver its part of the contract. But I want to start the first phase right here: to know the ground we stand on, to create a clear will for this change and then to try to bring closure to it. It is politically important to do so before the next European elections. I hope you agree and I hope you will help to create that climate for a majority for change.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned at the outset that there is a great appetite for change. Very many colleagues feel that the House lacks vitality in many of its debates and we need to work on this. I look forward to the Corbett report and whatever change that may bring. I do not prejudge its outcome – it is still a matter of debate and controversy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no monopoly on wisdom, but we know – even as far as it goes or may go – that the Corbett report itself is just a start. The House will decide on the Corbett report – the President will not.</p>
<p class="contents">But a point I want to make: whatever powers that gives to the presidency to try to regulate how we do our business on the floor – to have fewer votes, more work done in committees and then to create space here for real political debate – I will use it to the maximum extent. So I want people to know in advance: whatever that platform is, I want to use it in a way that opens up space to have creative political debate on the floor of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a wonderful debate yesterday on the Middle East but we need a lot more of that class of activity because we are a political institution.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard – I claim no monopoly of wisdom in this – I cannot displace the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – but I pose, Laeken-like, a number of questions. Why is it when we have a debate that the groups have not so far been able to agree that somewhere – maybe for the last third – we actually ask colleagues to respond to each other? Why do we not create a dynamic which demands that we debate and not simply read statements? Some way or another we need to respond to each other. Should we consider on committees, that where there is a report where there is broad agreement but where there are key amendments on which there is clear disagreement, that we could through the Conference of Presidents debate only the key amendments? It is sometimes done on the floor of the Congress in the US – not the whole debate but the debate on the key amendments, because that is the part that has the political voltage running through it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at some of these things and I invite you to look creatively at them, because we need more vitality and we ourselves can gift this to ourselves if we are creative enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to which I referred earlier on enlargement, covers 2 500 legislative acts over 50 years and 85 000 pages of legislation. On the Eur-Lex website you will find half of those acts in a consolidated form – not yet the law, because we have never made a law to consolidate all those acts – but you will nonetheless find that half the <span class="italic">acquis</span> is now on Eur-Lex in its shortened form. I am told that through consolidated text we could reduce the 85 000 pages to 25 000. That is already very big but it would be some achievement. I believe that we should work with the other institutions to do this as a matter of priority. It is a failure in strategic planning that it has not been done already. It should have been done in advance of enlargement, for which these 85 000 pages of text are now being translated. However, we should do it primarily for citizens who want to connect to European law, to find in one place one consolidated text that explains their rights and the limits to them. I hope that we can engage in an exercise with the other institutions on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We as Parliament have a public purpose to bring real value to debate, to be a continental-scale legislator. I want over the next period to try to sell our story better than we have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to propose to the Bureau a comprehensive stocktaking exercise in order to provide Parliament with modern and streamlined information policies. I want with you to develop a communication strategy before the next European election in 2004. We will have to invest in intellectual honesty and political realism to recognise past defects; to look at the underlying reasons for those defects; to look at any confusion about images of our institution in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many strengths to build on, not least our unique status as the largest elected representative assembly on our continent. The pivotal role that we play in the Convention itself also requires a special exercise in communication. As I said earlier – and I close on this – we must earn the consent of today's generation of Europeans. This is the tribune of the people where that process must play itself out: creating a cultural transformation, recognising our responsibilities towards enlargement, towards building new strategic partnerships, stressing the primacy of politics, reforming the House, communicating our public purpose. These are the aims of my presidency. They can be summarised in one phrase: working together to create a Europe fit for its future.</p>

Mr President, I would like to express our group's congratulations and appreciation to you for the way you have just spoken. One got the feeling from your speech that your role as President is not just a representative duty for you, but that politics, what we can do here in Parliament, is something close to your heart. In any case, it is that sentiment that communicated itself to us. We want to thank you for that and express the hope that you will be able to keep to this policy in these two and a half years of practical work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I feel particular gratitude for the way you spoke out in favour of us inviting observers from the candidate countries to Parliament and to our groups once the treaties have been signed. I think that this idea, which our Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has promoted for some time, is an excellent one. We must make it clear that political debate must not be dominated by such issues as when agricultural aid is going to be fully operational in the candidate countries, when these or those other conditions are going to be complied with, but we must rather be saying clearly even now to people in the candidate countries: you are welcome in our community of shared values. That is why we also want soon to welcome to Parliament members of the national parliaments as observers, as partners in dialogue, as people with whom we can discuss the future of Europe. We are right alongside you if you are about to put that formally into effect by means of resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You rightly spoke about the strategic partnership in the Mediterranean countries, in which context you mentioned human rights. It is easy for us in this House to talk about human rights in quite abstract terms. We have been talking about terrorism in recent weeks and months. My group is definitely in favour of combating terrorism, but, in the weeks, months and years ahead, we must take care not to permit violations of human rights in the name of counter-terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must speak out when human rights are violated. Let me give Chechnya as a quite specific example. We must not close our eyes to what is happening in Chechnya just because we say we have to combat terrorism. This is something we cannot allow!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned interinstitutional balance. It is with great disquiet that I see how some governments are now trying, for whatever reasons they may have, to cut down to size the European Commission's role as Guardian of the Treaties. Even though it may bring us into dispute with a government on our side, our group will not permit a crucial Community institution such as the Commission to have its rights and powers interfered with. It is the Commission that is the Guardian of the Treaties! Madam Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, we urge you to pursue this approach with determination. We are there alongside you.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about the Convention. We are, in fact, going to be discussing it this afternoon with the President. I believe that, right from the start, we have to counteract the impression that it is not the Convention that is to play the principal role. We have a praesidium in which there are three people with specific offices: the chairman and his two deputies. We need working procedures for the Convention. That is the new method and you have given it expression. We need a way of working that is transparent and public, and that is why the Convention as a whole must be at the heart of the work. The work cannot be delegated to the praesidium, to the triumvirate of the chairman and his two deputies. It is clear that the leadership function naturally devolves upon the praesidium, but the work tempo – including the frequency of the Convention's meetings – must be such that it is the Convention that conducts the debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the issue of the statute, which you have addressed, our group supports the introduction of a Members' Statute, but we also say that Members' independence, integrity and dignity must be guaranteed, and, in law, it is we who draw up the Members' Statute – and not the Council! So, at the end of the day, this is not about us saying ‘yes’ to something proposed by the Council, but rather we are the ones who make the proposal, and then we must work with the Council towards a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me a concluding observation, Mr President. You have just referred to Mr von Wogau's report on the financial services proposals and on the Lamfalussy Final Report, on which we voted yesterday. I am addressing my remarks to Mr Ramón de Miguel and to the Council when I say that this was a fine hour for the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. If that is how we go about our business in future, we will achieve something. This is not just about which of us – Commission, Council or Parliament – achieves the most; on the contrary, our common task is to get Europe moving. Your speech, Mr President, was manifestly in this spirit. We stand alongside you, encouraging you to be committed and consistent in giving your words practical expression over the next two and a half years.</p>

You started with a statement: the culture of change in this second half of the legislature. I would say that, fundamentally, what this requires is the consolidation of the culture of democracy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a veritable obstacle race, in political and electoral terms, in the next two and a half years. I believe that there are basically two things we must do: one concerns our citizenship. We already have European citizenship and the euro, but we must convince our citizens to participate actively in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament. And this is something that we must all do together.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must focus on those who wish to become citizens of the European Union, the citizens of the candidate countries and try to engage them in the most noble aspect of our great adventure, which is not simply discussing budgetary issues, but sharing a common destiny founded on peace and democracy. I would say that these are the noble objectives that we share with a view to making Monetary Union, which is already a reality, into an Economic Union and, above all, as you rightly said, a Political Union, giving primacy to the most noble aspect of politics in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another important dimension to the European Parliament, which is our voice stating the universal primacy of human rights. Not because we are superior, but because we Europeans have learned, in the course of a long and painful history, that human rights are the best cement for maintaining peace and prosperity. This is an important point, both with regard to the world that borders our own – I am thinking here of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and also the Mediterranean – and especially with regard to the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that yesterday, for the first time, a large number of Members took part in the debate on the Middle East. We must keep this up.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the most tangible issues that you raised, the agenda of reforms, I should like to express my agreement with you, in that the most important thing we can do is to make our message more specific and to give primacy to political debates. In this regard, I also wish to thank you for having mentioned the work of the members of my Group, who are also Members of this Parliament, but whom you mentioned specifically.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the reform of the Rules of Procedure, the Corbett report. It is obviously Parliament that must decide, but the President also has powers of proposal and of approval. The Corbett reform is not only the product of the rapporteur or of the Socialist Group. This reform is something as vital to us as the air that we breathe. It is absolutely crucial if we are to ensure that our debates resonate beyond the walls of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Members’ Statute. At the moment, the Members’ Statute, which is a long-standing ambition of this Parliament, towards which we have been working for many years, is not simply something we wish to see. It is constitutionally essential if Parliament is going to be a member of the European Union with full rights. This is the issue: we are not simply discussing the problems, the type of Assembly or the advantages that we could gain. This is an issue of dignity and of equality between the citizens and their representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, you have always had the support of the Socialist Group on this matter, and considerable progress has been made by recent governments that are part of our political family. I also hope that you also maintain your resolute support for the work being done by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not only because he is rapporteur for the Socialist Group, but as I have said on other occasions, because this is the birthright of the entire Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to defending democracy within the European Union, I welcome the agreement reached yesterday on the Lamfalussy programme on the basis of the von Wogau report. I wish to highlight a few points that I consider to be crucial and which should lead to Parliament maintaining a very firm stance.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all: governance. This is an absolutely crucial issue and we must prevent a drastic reduction of our powers and a return to commitology. I urge you, Mr President, to ensure that the interinstitutional working party announced by President Prodi in the December Plenary and which the President of the Council, Mr Aznar, also ratified here, is set up as quickly as possible so that we do not see our power of codecision eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, immunity. Recently, there has been a major shortcoming on an essential issue, from the point of view of the dignity of Members. I am counting on you to take this issue seriously so that we do not find ourselves in a situation in which a fundamental aspect of parliamentary dignity is rendered meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Convention. I also thank you for having today appointed Giscard d’Estaing as its Chairman. The Convention is the daughter of our parliamentary work, but it also has other partners and members and I think that Parliament must act as the keeper of the conscience in this field to ensure that the Convention is visible to the public, achieves tangible results and is not simply a forum for discussion. Furthermore, it must be able to push forward and develop something on which we can all agree.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Mr President – and with this I shall close – we supported an excellent candidate, Mr Martin. I see that you have integrated many of Mr Martin’s ideas into your campaign, but in any event, I should like to say that if you implement this programme, you will have the loyal and honest support of the Socialist Group in this work, which concerns all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Riis-Jørgensen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, my dear Pat, congratulations once again, this time on your new professional début. It is splendid to see you doing what you promised. You are showing yourself to be trustworthy. We have obtained a new Europe today, but we have also had a new Parliament since January. Now, we are to be politicians, not technicians, and you have shown, and will show, us the way. Pat, we are hungry, in fact very hungry, and we have an appetite for change. Our group will support you entirely as you prepare the individual dishes that can satisfy us. However, our group will always have an appetite for change. In Denmark, we have a lovely song that our family often sings. It goes like this: ‘Life’s harvest is in struggle never ceasing…’, ‘…while changeless calm is death’s abode’. Our group has always wished for struggle, for we have an appetite for change.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is the most important matter we are facing at this time. It is about people rather than about technical devices, budgets, laws and rules. We are clearly the place where people are to meet, and we must make this place work. Our group will do everything to move the tradition on, as we have already done by now inviting members of the national parliaments in the candidate countries to visit us. What is most important, however – and what we have a very great appetite for – are reforms to this House of ours. We have a need for reforms, and not only reforms of our statute – important as those are – but also changes to the way in which we work, so that we can deliver the results our electorate wants to see.</p>
<p class="contents">That leads me on to my next point, concerning contact with the people. The prerequisite for being in touch with the people is that we should be able to deliver the goods and, more specifically, the goods that people demand. That means being able to put our own house in order and being effective and concentrating on what is really important and what we have some influence upon. In those terms, what is most important are reforms, results and communication, and certainly it is splendid to hear you communicate. You are enthusiastic, you show your feelings, you are colourful in your speech and you use the right words. I would almost go so far as to say that we in effect have a female President, for you employ the feminine side of your personality: imagination and creativity; and that is what we need if we are to reach our citizens. We must be politicians, not technicians. All right, we were unable to have a woman as President, but a man with feminine sides to his personality is no bad thing either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention is what is most important in connection with the Europe of the future. Moreover, it is important that we should not just engage in navel-gazing but try to find solutions to the tasks facing us. Rather than get bogged down in a dispute about whether we are to have a ‘Constitution’, a ‘Basic Treaty’ or a ‘federation’, we should design a system in which there is democratic control over political decisions. When we draw up legislation for our citizens, they must be able to see who are making the decisions, and those who are must be democratically accountable for them. That is the message of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. We want to see political accountability in Europe. We are “fit for the future”, but our group is also “fit to fight for the new Europe”, as well as being “fit to fight for the future together with yourself”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not want to be a well-oiled voting machine. We want to make history and we want to highlight Europe’s own role in the world at a time when peace and stability in the world are under threat. It is not sufficient to organise development cooperation. We must be able to promote peace and stability in a European manner, on the basis of our values. We want to maximise our role as a parliament. We want to monitor. We want to enact laws on behalf of public opinion but also in contact with that opinion and with the media which should bring us closer to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has been made. I arrived in this Parliament having had experience of many parliaments before, sometimes parliaments which were usually better attended than this one, a phenomenon which I regret. Outside these walls, people often think that we are not a real parliament, but I have found a true parliament here. However, we must ensure that we have a statute, we agree with you on that, otherwise we as MEPs lack credibility. In addition, we must also further shape the assistants’ statute into which Mr Onesta has put such great effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we must be given more competences. Codecision must be extended rather than eroded, and this must be done in a fully transparent manner. Needless to say, the activities must be reformed. The will to reform is there. A great deal can be done within the current Rules of Procedure, provided that the will is there, the will to debate rather than read out little monologues prepared on paper, the will to be present and to enter into dialogue with each other. The debate must not stifle pluralism, quite the contrary. We are here to talk, for we are a parliament in which it must be possible to express the whole range of opinions. This is why we do believe that the Corbett report is a solid basis for a discussion, but if it means that the rights of small groups are cut back, or the rights of individual MEPs compromised, then we touch the soul and diversity of this Parliament, and that is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to express our slight concern to the Council. Parliament cannot accept shortened procedures if the Council fails to debate with us in our committees. We can hold more debates there, but not in the absence of the Council, not without the attendant transparency and not without the debate that we want. We must condemn creeping reforms without clear objectives. We want more democracy, respect for subsidiarity, a rapprochement between citizens and the European Parliament and a dialogue with the regional and national parliaments. If not, the already strong distrust among our citizens will only grow. We must clearly establish the legal basis for our actions once and for all, and not let our legal basis be taken away.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your instruction to prepare the future in consultation with public opinion and with the parliaments in the candidate countries. You are moving closer to them. We encounter them in the joint meetings. Why do we not open up our committees to enter into debate with them, as we also want to do with our own public opinion, and why do we not open up our sumptuous chambers more than has hitherto been the case?</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention will be the proof of the pudding. We are putting our trust in this. If we want to prepare Europe for tackling the enormous tasks of enlargement, the Convention cannot afford to fail. It should not endeavour to write a cookery book, which is subsequently used in some new night-time session to concoct a grim menu. We want a Convention that knows the direction in which Parliament wants to guide it. As the European Parliament, we must face up to our task in that Convention and involve the others in that debate, both regional and national parliaments, as well as public opinion, and ensure that Europe takes the qualitative step forward that is required for enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament, I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President. Basing my comments on the undisputed observation that the increasing numbers of citizens are showing a very worrying lack of interest in the European institutions, I said that the number one priority of the new President should be to do everything in his power to win back their confidence. I am therefore pleased to see that this objective is implicit in your programme. You said that we must win back the confidence of the people. We fully support you in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">How can this be achieved in practical terms? I myself have come up with three ideas. I think that two of them partly cover the same areas as your plans, but I would venture to say that the third idea could remedy a shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">The first idea concerns the involvement of citizens in the debate on the future of Europe. I suggested that our President launch, in parallel with the work of the Convention and in conjunction with the national parliaments, a campaign on the theme ‘Let your voice be heard’. This would be an incredibly bold experiment for our institution to undertake. We should stimulate a real confrontation of ideas, as you said, we should listen to what the people have to say to us on what they expect from Europe and strive to connect the Convention to the subjects of these diverse discussions. Then we should all face up to our responsibilities. We want the Convention to shake up the IGC, so let the citizens shake up the Convention!</p>
<p class="contents">My second idea was for our President to take the initiative, along with ourselves, in organising meetings in Parliament of groups of citizens from various European countries to discuss common objectives that we could support.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned three examples. The first is to organise meetings involving young people to discuss questions that directly concern them, such as Erasmus-type grants or the full and mutual recognition of qualifications, as well as broader subjects – we could call them more civilisation-related issues, like those that were recently discussed in Porto Alegre, under the alluring title ‘Another world is possible’. Another example is to invite women from all over Europe to meet and discuss the question of the full application of Treaty provisions that encourage equality. The last example, which is similar to your proposal, Mr President, is to organise meetings of members of civil society from the candidate countries and Member States to examine, together, the ins and outs of this quite historic undertaking and to give us the best possible chances of making it a success. In the same spirit, you proposed to invite observers from the candidate countries and we shall support you in this effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The third idea that I mentioned two months ago is the only one that I fear was missing from the speech you gave this morning, and that is the idea of putting pressure on the Commission and the Council regarding several emblematic legislative texts that clearly spell out to our fellow citizens the direction in which we want to take Europe in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally thinking, particularly at a time when so many businesses are undergoing restructuring, of the directives such as that on the information and consultation of workers, that on the European Works Councils, or even of the framework directive on services of general interest, and am looking forward to the possible – and, in my view, desirable – reform of the Treaties in this crucial area.</p>
<p class="contents">The general approach advocated by my group and the many practical suggestions that turn it into a reality are the same as they were before your election and they will remain thus during your mandate. In this spirit, we will naturally be prepared to help you to make our Parliament a positive role model for millions of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, on a lighthearted note may I firstly say that I am extremely pleased to be here to witness the discovery of the feminine side of your personality, revealed to us this morning. Let me also assure colleagues that there is a tougher side to the personality of the President, as I have seen in another House in another place.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the statement made by the President to us here this morning. I am genuinely pleased with the response to it by the people who have already spoken. It augurs well for the change that we know must take place – a change that we have been hesitant to face up to for quite a considerable period of time. I would like to go on record as saying that this, in my view, is the first serious attempt in a long time to take up the challenge of the need for change. We often see change as something that is always desirable but that can wait until tomorrow. Now, with Pat Cox as our President, we must confront it from day one. I welcome that. There is an obligation on each and every one of us to support that change.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group in particular welcomes the changes that you have outlined in your statement. They will make this Parliament more meaningful. They will give it the role that Parliament must, and should, have and which we know it has not got. They will give us the type of debate that will mean we can put away all the documents we read diligently and carefully on technical matters that we should not be debating at all. Let us debate the political issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the good debate we had yesterday with the High Representative, Javier Solana. It was a good and open debate, but we should have had more debates like that one. It should not just be a privilege for us to have Mr Solana present; perhaps he should be here on a more regular basis. He is accountable to this Parliament – we should not overlook that. That is important too. I was delighted that Commissioner Patten was here yesterday because his is a role that we must respect and support as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Commission and the Spanish presidency for being here at this most important debate here today. They too have a role. I have consistently supported the view that the Commission's best friend is the European Parliament. Parliament will support the Commission and make sure it is not sidelined by one or two of the larger Member States wishing to do so for any particular reason. I also know that the Commission is the best friend of the smaller Member States within the European Union, which can count on protection when they need it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the representatives of the Spanish presidency, it is right and proper that they are here today and I thank them for coming. Last November they came and met the political leaders of the groups in this Parliament and held open consultations with them on the agenda that they proposed to put forward during their presidency. This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome, value and appreciate. It is not so long ago that the outgoing presidency refused to come to this Parliament to report on its activities because it wanted to go immediately afterwards. It did not want to answer questions. We should not accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">Much reform is required within this House. We will support that reform. I welcome what Mr Cox has said on the different matters he mentioned. He mentioned the need for the statute. There is full support for the statute and I welcome the fact that the consultation is going to take place from the bottom up, involving everybody in a decent, fair, upright, open and democratic fashion. This will contrast with the past, when Mr Rothley was working on his own and efforts were made just to get a deal done to give a presidency something to their credit at the end of the day. That was not good enough then. It will not be good enough now. We have all involved ourselves in this debate and something worthwhile will come from it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the workings of the Convention, I very much welcome the suggestions that have been made here today. I would add, though perhaps not with 100% conviction, that the meeting that is taking place today between Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the heads of the political groups should not have been confined to the heads of the political groups. Consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this House to let all Members see what is going on. We have urged Mr Giscard d'Estaing not to have his little meetings behind closed doors. We have called for the rhythm of the Convention to be dictated from the floor and to involve the Members from the different states in this House, yet we assist Mr Giscard d'Estaing by having a private, cosy little lunch at which half a dozen people will be present. Think again, Mr President, when these matters come up for debate and discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enlargement, I very much welcome and support your initiative to invite representatives from the parliaments of the applicant states. That is good, right and proper. Let us have debate and discussion. One small word of caution: let us not overplay our role and move into an area where we might be overlapping the negotiating mandate of the Commission. We have to be careful and I would trust your experience and judgement in that. I speak from my own limited experience in that area, which I shall relate at another time and in another place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support and commend your approach towards promoting external affairs. Might I ask you to look at the role of the parliamentary delegations in this particular area? Are we doing Parliament justice? Are we doing justice to anyone when we meet a delegation from India, say, or China once a year for one-and-a-half or two days? Is that promoting foreign relations? No, not in any shape or form. Why are we not, for instance, opening up discussions and debate with Iran at the present time? If those advocating change within the Iranian regime need help and support through debates and discussions with people like us, why are not we giving them that? Is it not about time we became masters of our own policy, our own approach, our own attitude in foreign affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you have made a great start. I warmly support you. I wish you well and I will be with you right along the way.</p>

We have taken the time to discuss our own circumstances, and I should like to thank the President for his contribution and the discussion today, as well as table proposals for consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Consolidation of the laws could of course take place through our refusing to debate, or directly rejecting, proposals that are not consolidated. It cannot be sensible to accumulate 70 amendments in order to see how the law stands where fish are concerned. A reform in the interests of transparency should ensure that all meetings are open and all documents accessible, unless a qualified majority approves an exemption supported by reasons, of the kind we approved in the Martin/Bourlanges report. Political appointments must be a thing of the past. In future, everyone should be appointed and promoted according to their qualifications, here in Parliament too, and we could make a fresh start with those who are now to be appointed from the candidate countries. The plenary sittings must be turned into lively occasions. A third of the time could be set aside for spontaneous debate, as you intimated. Those active in Parliament must have the opportunity to tackle the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council if they do not receive answers. All MEPs must be permitted to speak at least three times a year. The number of votes must be cut back so that we are only voting on political differences. After each debate, the coordinators should meet and make the technical preparations for the voting. Details of the voting list should be known at least a week before voting takes place so that we can all consult our electorates and be aware of what we are voting on.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which posts are distributed should be revised. The d’Hondt method could be replaced by the Saint Laguë method in which the distribution is on the basis of 1,3,5 instead of 1,2,3,4,5. It would provide the same proportionate distribution, but it would make it possible for the smaller groups not always to have to take what the large groups leave aside and, in cases where the small groups are not represented, they could be appointed as observers. The independent Members should have their quota of opportunities, and we should ourselves remove all forms of discrimination instead of risking new legal proceedings. The Corbett report’s attack on the small political groups should be replaced by a gentlemen’s agreement through which we achieve some of Mr Corbett's objectives without reducing the groups’ rights. In the Convention, majorities and minorities must have the same access to qualified aid and be able to put forward, and campaign for, proposals in the same way. There cannot be special rights for specific positions. The European Movement and the federalists do not have a sole and exclusive right to organise the debate with civil society using Parliament’s money. We must join in getting the whole of Parliament and the Convention to operate in such a way that all Members representing all positions feel they are being treated properly and on an equal basis. Today at the meeting with Mr Giscard d’Estaing, we must make a point of ensuring that all alternates in the Convention are given full rights of participation in the work. Good luck with the reform work! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dell'Alba (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, you have called for a more democratic and less bureaucratic Parliament. I see this as an important concept, and so I would like to start with the situation of the Unattached Members, the 33 truly second-class Members who do not have access to the d’Hondt system which is used to distribute everything in this House, who are not entitled to table documents or amendments and who are forced to admit even to their electorate that they are unable to play a full part in the Parliament’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a report which has been at a standstill for two years in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs; moreover a judgement was returned a few months ago by the Court of Justice which raised a number of important points in terms of whether those measures were appropriate or did not need to be amended, or whether legal penalties should not be imposed for failure to apply them. Mr President, I call upon you to pursue this matter and to revitalise that aspect of the work of this House, for I feel that, precisely with regard to the goal you mentioned, one of the problems facing us is not just the general, essential need to make our working methods more democratic and to ensure greater participation by all the Members, but also to take into consideration the second-class status of the Unattached Members which is endorsed and still confirmed in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, Mr President, as has already been said, the Corbett report not only fails to provide an adequate response but is also, in a number of respects, a caricature of what should be an endeavour to improve our conditions. How could one possibly envisage – the Members may not be aware of this, but Mr Corbett did make this suggestion – doing away with topical and urgent debates, which are one of Parliament’s opportunities for real political debate, as President Cox said? At this point, we might just as well do away with the resolutions at the end of political debates as well and, that way, we will become even more of a machine for voting on reports. I feel that this is not the right direction to take and, in this connection, I genuinely hope that the political groups, the Members and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs itself will carefully reconsider this suggestion, which is not a good one. Mr President, we need a Parliament whose work is better structured. When we have major debates, attended by members of the Commission or the Council but where only 10 or 15 Members of this House are present, it does not reflect well on Parliament. Parliament is not doing itself any service. Then, two hours later, maybe, this House becomes a sort of voting chamber, not least because, as we know, the existence of a certain penalty system makes it convenient to come here and vote. We used to have explanations of vote and a system which made debates visible and comprehensible for journalists and the public. That is no longer the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point concerns publishing our debates. Mr Collins has raised this point and the other Unattached Members agree with him. Even today, for example, this meeting could have been organised in such a way that everyone participated or it could even have been transmitted over the internal system. I feel, and it is our deep conviction, Mr President, that, just as your election was broadcast over the Internet – and this was a major step forward – in this age of the Internet, both committee and plenary debates can and should be broadcast to give all the citizens, not just the European citizens, access to our work.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word on the subject of the statute, Mr President. The statute is important, but it must also include Members’ prerogatives; in other words, it must not be a statute centred solely on the financial side of being a Member of Parliament. I feel that the challenge facing us is to produce a Statute that definitively defines and establishes MEPs’ status, their responsibilities, their prerogatives and their rights in respect of the institutions preparing for enlargement. I wish you every success in your work in this area, Mr President, and I hope that major reforms will be achieved under your presidency before 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, David (PSE).</span></span>   – I wish to begin by congratulating you on the state-of-the-European-Parliament address, which perhaps, like other state-of-the-Union addresses, should become an annual event.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally think you have made a very positive start as President of the European Parliament. If we are to carry out the reform agenda that you have discussed, then we need an <span class="italic">esprit de corps</span> in this House. The way in which you have engaged the Bureau of Parliament, the Conference of Presidents, the committee chairs in your agenda, already in your first month, shows a determination to work across the whole of this House in order to deliver reform, and that is very encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">But, at the same time, you have also done the same with the institutions. Although we should not overstate these things, there is already an improved relationship between the Commission and the Council and this institution – and, perhaps most importantly – you have shown a willingness to take tough decisions. That is something which, I am afraid, will become more and more a feature of your presidency, but we will have more and more occasion to take hard decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have any criticism of your speech, it was not in terms of the content – there was hardly a word I disagreed with – but that I perhaps detected an element of "mission creep" in your speech. If you try to do everything, you may end up not succeeding in doing very much. I would encourage you to stick to just two or three key items: enlargement being the vital one; the internal reform of this House being the second; and also, as others have said, the communication strategy of this House to connect better with the citizens of the European Union. If you achieve progress in these three areas, you will have achieved very much indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Your speech also correctly got to the dilemma that we face. If we are to improve our standing as an institution, then we have to reform internally. That means a little navel-gazing. However, if we spend two-and-a-half years navel-gazing, then we will be even further away from the citizens out there. So we have to combine the two. We have to conduct reform within the structures of this House while on the floor of this House, as you rightly say, connecting with the citizens by discussing the major items that face them in their daily lives – to actually talk about the issues that matter out there, not the issues that matter in here. It is out there that really matters to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dell'Alba made a point I had wanted to make. When you talked about inviting the members of the applicant countries' parliaments to be present at the enlargement debate here, I agreed with you, but my immediate reaction was to wonder where were they going to sit.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I looked around the Chamber and realised that there would be no problem in finding seats for them in this House. There we have a double dilemma: one that you have identified, which is to make our debates more lively and interesting; but another one, which we have tried in the past to solve and need to try again: to make this plenary the focus of our four days' work in Strasbourg. There is plenty of other time for committee and delegation meetings, and for meeting lobbyists, etc., but when we are in Strasbourg, the plenary should be the centre-point of our activities. In fact, for most Members it is a side-show when they come to Strasbourg; the average Member spends less than five hours in this Chamber during a Strasbourg week. It should be where they are most of the time; it should be the focus of our activity; you should feel that if you have not been present at the plenary, you have missed out on something. Instead, sometimes you feel that when you have been in the plenary you have missed out on something that has been going on elsewhere. So we have to refocus to make this the centre of activity: a livelier Chamber where we really discuss the day-to-day issues.</p>
<p class="contents">One last but important point, because both you, Mr President, and Mr Poettering in different ways referred to it. I welcome the decision on the von Wogau report – it was a right decision. But I do not believe, as you indicated, that better regulation or the long-term solution to what Mr von Wogau was dealing with in the Lamfalussy proposals can be left to the Convention. We have to focus on that in the next two or three months because the June Summit will deal with governance and better regulation, and it may be, if we do not focus on that now, that by the time we get to the Convention the pass will have been sold in June, so it is important that we look at this issue now and do not think that von Wogau was even a five- or six-month solution. It was a short two- or three-month solution to a very important point in terms of the powers of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much and, again, congratulations on the progress you have made so far.</p>

As I address you, it is a great pleasure for all of us to move from the era of Paddy the Irishman to Paddy the President. In your own area of Cork in Ireland they would be tickled pink to think that we were discussing the feminine side of Pat Cox in Parliament this morning. But it is right that we should. I concur with Mr Collins. But there would be some amusement in some of the more rural parts of Ireland at the tone of the debate. I thank you for your contribution this morning. I thoroughly support your plan, as you have laid it before us.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, thank you for addressing us in a language that was devoid of Eurospeak. One of the great problems in all the European institutions is that we have developed a language, a glossary of terminology that has created a barrier between ourselves and the people of Europe we represent. We have created that barrier not just between the people but between ourselves and the media, on whom we depend to sell our message to the people of Europe. Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak. For that I warmly congratulate you. It is important that we all follow suit – from the technical end to us as parliamentarians – as we express ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">May your enthusiasm not wane for the next two-and-a-half years and may it prove to be infectious as you represent us throughout Europe and indeed further afield. May your affection and obvious love of this Parliament, of these European institutions prove to be infectious as you address gatherings throughout your term in office. May it be particularly infectious in our country of Ireland as we endeavour to awaken from their slumber, from their indifference the 65% of the Irish electorate who failed to turn out to vote for the Nice Treaty last June, as we yet again try to offer them the opportunity to endorse enlargement of Europe between now and the end of December this year. It is most important that we enthuse our peoples and – top of your agenda – enthuse the Irish people for the enlargement project which we all support.</p>

I am delighted that you have emphasised the ‘primacy of politics’. In the final analysis, this Parliament has grown from a paper tiger into a watchdog of democracy, and that is down to politics. In my view, communication and information are crucial in this connection. Information more so than communication. They are not the same. Communication is about bringing news. Information implies a dialogue with those to whom the information is directed. The dialogue must be open and objective, and should not degenerate into indoctrination and propaganda but should comprise communication and information. Sound information means that one has to present something of substance, that one has something to offer or something that one can pass on. It need not be perfect, but a dialogue is necessary to make any improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">How will we deal with this? There are countless reports on this subject. I myself had the honour of being the author of one of the many that are stored in the dark recesses of this institution. There have been many reports, yet little has changed in the many years I have been in this Parliament. How will we tackle this? Could I make a suggestion, as we have tried all manner of things? Why do we not hold an open debate? You as representative of Parliament, along with those you select, you on behalf of Parliament along with the representatives of the media. Not with the intention to indoctrinate. I know how anxious the media is about propaganda, and with good reason. But simply an open dialogue to examine together how we can best serve the parliamentary, democratic culture, and hence Europe, a democratic Europe, for this is what is at stake in the final analysis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I wish to say first of all that your work programme is also ours and that really your ambitions are also ours, and I am sure you will have the support of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make three distinct observations. Mr President, you spoke of a realistic and intelligent defence of the prerogatives of this House; you mentioned the Lamfalussy report; also, yesterday you decided not to attend the Court of Justice and to adopt a long-sighted approach on a matter vital to Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that this intelligent defence of our prerogatives – which are not our own, but which represent our responsibility towards the citizens – is a <span class="italic">leitmotif</span> that I wish to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this defence of our prerogatives and this maintaining of better relations with the other two institutions, in which we all have an interest, there is, nevertheless, one aspect that you touched on briefly and on which I should like to focus: access to the ‘screening’ documents for the candidate countries which, to date, are being denied us.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense for us to ask our colleagues from the candidate countries to familiarise themselves with these ‘screening’ documents, whilst we ourselves do not have access to them. This is one of the practical issues, which should not simply be of concern to us, but which we should attend to immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerning this Parliament’s prerogatives is image. One image reveals more than a thousand words and the press conference held yesterday by the three institutions, together with the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, will mean that, in future, we will not have to read, as has happened before, that a directive has been approved, when what has really been approved is a Council common position. The three institutions are committed to demonstrating responsibility towards the citizens to produce effective and good legislation. Which leads to the second aspect: the insistence on the rigour of this institution is important. The three institutions have to improve the quality of legislation. This has been said on various occasions and is one of the great challenges overall, not just for the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation must be legible despite its complexity. We must eschew jargon and unintelligible expressions, as has been said. To this end, when it comes to reforming this House, I wish to point out that this is a House of committees. We must support your idea – expressed, amongst others, by the Provan group and by other working parties within Parliament’s Bureau – that the more technical work must be carried out by the committees, but without its visibility to the citizens suffering. It is important that the citizens understand the work we are undertaking, not only in Plenary, which is already happening, but also in the committees. This is why we have to improve the committee’s system of communication with our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by discussing a third aspect, which is dialogue with the citizens. Mr President, you are a magnificent representative of what this House stands for. Your personal skills will ensure that we are able to undertake a useful piece of work.

This debate has shown that there is much support and much appetite in this House for reform, in this lively exchange we are having in the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">You were kind enough to refer to my own report, which hopefully will be on the agenda at the next part-session. We are building quite a broad consensus on the bulk of the proposals contained in my report. In the last few days many groups have been kind enough to invite me to address their meetings and to engage in building this consensus. I am now quite confident that there will be a majority next month in favour of a useful package of reforms that will not solve all our problems – far from it – but will be a useful step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">To those colleagues who feared that there may be elements of my report which are unfavourable to the smaller groups, I would like to reassure them. There is nothing that significantly undermines the position of the smaller groups in my report. If they continue to have fears, I shall be very happy to meet them to try to find a solution to any issue they wish to raise. My preferred solution is to persuade them, but I am open to other solutions if we can find them. This will be a useful part of the reform process and I thank you very much for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with everything that has been said about reform. But when we talk about reform, let us not forget the conditions in which backbench MEPs work in this House. David Martin reproached us for not spending more time in the Chamber, but one of the problems is the amount of time we waste getting to this place. I will not relaunch that debate, but anyone looking at this splendid Chamber and the palatial public spaces of this building would not believe the cramped conditions in which a backbench MEP works. Please do not forget, you important people who have spacious offices – even the secretaries-general of the political groups have office space four times that of a backbench MEP – that when you have an assistant and a <span class="italic">stagiaire</span> crammed into one office, you have no place in which to meet visitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, will you at least pledge to back us in getting computers for MEPs, preferably flat-screen computers so we can fit them on to our desks in our tiny offices and be more efficient for the 21st century? I am sorry to raise such a brass-tacks issue: I know parliamentarians are always shy about raising the matter of their own working conditions but, frankly, unless we can be efficient in dealing with our work, we cannot deliver good service and present a good showcase to the world. I would not like people to look at the masses of space in the public areas and then come and see our little cramped offices, out of which we lose a third for a useless bathroom – but that is another matter. Please help us to be efficient, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Verheugen is alleged to have assented in the Commission to the Commission's decisions, but then, last Sunday, to have dissociated himself from them in an interview with a German newspaper. I wish to ask you to give consideration to a procedure whereby we, that is, in Parliament or some appropriate forum, might hear an explanation of this from Mr Verheugen.
