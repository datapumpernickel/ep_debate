<p class="contents">As you know, the House will discuss the Boogerd-Quaak report on the EC-USA agreement on PNR issues tomorrow evening. I do not wish to have that debate now. The reason I wish to consult the House at this moment is that our Rules of Procedure are clear: if I follow the advice of the Legal Affairs Committee, I act as a kind of postman through whom the request passes to the Court of Justice. It seems to me, given the issues involved, that it would be useful for me to benefit from the advice and guidance of the House. Therefore, under the Rules of Procedure, I had thought it better to pause for thought and to raise the matter at the opening of business today to hear a brief statement from the Commission and from the Groups, and then to ask the Groups tomorrow at midday to advise me as to whether to proceed in bringing the matter before the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Commissioner Bolkestein, who has been waiting here patiently as we arranged our business, to give a brief announcement concerning this aspect of the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this much-debated subject. The question that has been put to the Commission is a precise one: is the Commission prepared to withdraw its proposal to the Council to conclude an international agreement with the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name record data by air carriers to the US?</p>
<p class="contents">The context in which this question is asked is also clear. If the Commission does not indicate its willingness to follow Parliament's wish expressed in its Resolution of 31 March – namely to replace the present 'light' agreement and adequacy finding with a more substantive international agreement – Parliament will vote to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement currently before the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful for this opportunity to state its position in advance of the vote. In this context, I understand that Parliament seeks answers from the Commission on two issues. Firstly, Parliament wishes to know whether or not the proposed international agreement modifies the Data Protection Directive as far as data exchange with the United States is concerned, and, therefore, whether or not the agreement is well founded as far as both the protection of fundamental rights and the European Parliament's prerogatives are concerned. Secondly, Parliament wants the Commission to clarify the situation regarding data transfers by the United States to third country governments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, the Commission does not consider that the international agreement amends the Data Protection Directive and, therefore, there is no ground for basing it on the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) of the Treaty. If the agreement had amended the directive, the Commission would have proposed a different legal basis for the agreement and would have sought the assent of Parliament. But, I repeat, in our view, the agreement does not amend the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement leaves the protection afforded by the directive unchanged; in particular the proportionality requirement and the need for personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully. However, the international agreement is necessary to ensure a legitimate basis for air carriers and computer reservation systems to process the PNR data as asked for by the United States, insofar as they are covered by the adequacy finding.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that, the international agreement contains a number of important guarantees for the European Union; notably US commitments regarding non-discrimination and reciprocity and a joint EU-US review of the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second point concerning transfers to third countries, this is a new issue which came up in our talks with the United States only relatively recently. It concerns the safeguards that apply to the sharing by the United States of PNR data with law enforcement authorities in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As I drew to the attention of the House in my statement of 29 March, the Commission is still holding discussions with the United States on this point. In fact they have been continuing today and will continue further. I understand that the House would welcome further information on this point. In particular, the rapporteur raised the question of whether the Commission had come to a firm conclusion that there is adequate protection or whether these further talks meant that this question remained open.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussions with the United States on third country transfers have not yet been concluded. As I said earlier, they have been going on today and may continue tomorrow morning. Therefore, I cannot inform Parliament at this moment of the outcome in the required detail. Currently, Director-General Alex Schaub of the Directorate General for the Internal Market is, with his staff, negotiating this issue with the American side.</p>
<p class="contents">These talks are not designed to bring about any changes in the documents you have seen, but rather to clarify how the undertakings will be applied in the case of the transfer of PNR data to other countries. They will seek to ensure, in particular, that the purpose limitation agreed in paragraph 3 of the undertakings is respected, even when data is passed on to third countries. Of course, the Commission is pushing the United States for guarantees that are as strong as possible. This issue will be discussed at the meeting of the College of Commissioners tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Chris Patten will be addressing this House tomorrow evening on the international agreement. He will inform the House on the outcome of the discussions with the United States, and of any relevant developments.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, therefore, that it would be best for Mr Patten to inform the House following the Commission meeting tomorrow afternoon and then for the House to decide as it thinks best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What concerns us is that failure to come to the sort of agreement that the Commissioner has described will lead to a great deal of inconvenience for EU citizens travelling to the USA. If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require, they will obtain it by other means, whether this involves questioning at the border, mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates-General.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we do not get this agreement, our citizens will be in no better a legal position as regards data protection; indeed, they will be in a worse one, because we will have no influence whatever on what the Americans do with the data they obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts, and have, as a group, expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On top of that, there is not even any US legislation since no US law exists to protect private data.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore obliged to process our data, the data of our citizens, as requested by an administrative body of a third country. We therefore want an international agreement that grants rights. This controversy has been going on for a year and the Commission, even now, repeatedly says that the directive has not been amended, but on this basis it has been breached. This is the opinion of the majority of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are calling for a preliminary decision by the Court of Justice. I do not even believe that we need wait for further news tomorrow because, I reiterate, we have carried on for a year or more. The only way to solve the matter – as to if it is true or if it is not true that a right in the Treaty has been breached – is to ask the Court of Justice for a ruling in advance, before signing the agreement, so that we do not end up nullifying an agreement that has already been drawn up, since this would damage relations.</p>

My Group regrets that he has not been more successful in persuading the United States to respect our concerns about data privacy. My Group cannot agree on the choice of legal basis. While, as Mr Bolkestein says, the agreement does not formally amend our data protection directive, it clearly amends the law as it applies to European Community citizens by making us subject to US law in this area, and the absence of protection in US law is precisely our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a huge democratic deficit when the Commission comes forward with a proposal like this and does not give either the European Parliament or national parliaments the chance to say yes or no. Now, as Mr Bolkestein informs us, that the information being passed to the United States' authorities may be passed on to third country authorities, we should be seriously concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been three debates and votes in this House on the matter. Three committees have examined it and all recommended a referral to the Court of Justice. My Group does not seek a dispute with the Commission. We have asked the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to try to negotiate with the Americans and present to us and the US Congress a full-blown international agreement to cover these issues so that we can effectively fight terrorism together while respecting our commitments to data privacy. We would prefer the Commission to do that, but if the Commission cannot do it, perhaps at least at its meeting tomorrow the Commission could agree to take the initiative in referring the matter to the Court of Justice to decide whether there is adequacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On many occasions, the Commission has said that this is the best agreement that it could extract from the United States Government, but it must be said that, the more debates we have, the worse the situation gets for European citizens. Indeed, today we know that this agreement not only implies a violation of the Treaties, but even the possibility that these data will be transferred to a third country and will be processed by them, which thus made it more difficult to get the debate on the first part of the agreement under way.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, this Parliament has often said that it is against this agreement. Of course, it has not specifically voted on resorting to the Court of Justice but this, in my opinion, is a necessary consequence. We are therefore calling for Parliament to be able to take the opinion of a third, much respected and authoritative authority, such as the Court of Justice, and thus be able to freely decide whether to say yes or no to this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree that we should continue along our path, because I do not believe that Commissioner Bolkestein’s words are satisfactory and, indeed, I am also a little surprised by his lack of consideration for a vote, so unusual for Parliament, such as the one which took place at the last part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indisputable, Commissioner Bolkestein, that by not entering into a real international agreement with the United States, the Commission has chosen to bypass Parliament’s opinion. The fact that you have opted for soft law instead of a real agreement already speaks volumes about the Commission’s intentions to exclude democratic control of this agreement, and I find this particularly worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not seek a dispute with you – if, however, you are determined to force it on us then we will have no option but to fight it – but we believe that it is extremely important to seek the opinion of the Court of Justice. Your announcement, Commissioner, was not enough to prevent us doing so and we think that this stand will also be useful for the Commission so that, in the future, it will not commit these mistakes at the expense of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paragraph 4 of the agreement itself states that all data of European passengers will be processed according to US constitutional requirements. One of the laws in the United States that should apply is the Privacy Act, but this Act does not apply to people from third countries, to name but one example. Article 6 of the agreement states that there will be reciprocity insofar as feasible and that it shall be strictly applied. I do not want to have the debate now, but I can easily give you another ten examples of things that are not right and are, in my view, a violation of our privacy legislation. For that reason alone, we should put this matter to the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous debate, the Commissioner said, with regard to the passing on of data to third parties, that ‘we are still in negotiation with the United States’. I heard this correctly last time and also this time round. It is surely too crazy for words that I as rapporteur have to submit to this House a report on adequacy finding,<span class="italic"> </span>while the Commission itself still holds the view that the whole matter was inadequate. This is something I really do want to bring in to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank all those Members who have spoken out in favour of recourse to the Court. I think that the question to the Court, as to whether we can conclude international agreements in which both Parliament and the American Congress are placed offside, is a very interesting one indeed. In consultations with members of the Congress, I have been given to understand that, should such an agreement be put to the American Congress, it would never agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House should now also demonstrate that we know how to stand up for our citizens and not be put under pressure by anybody. We are alone in being able to do this. I am therefore hopeful that Parliament will follow the line taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The request for the prior opinion of the Court of Justice, as Mr Lehne, from my own political group has quite rightly said, will only postpone the signing of the agreement and leave a legal vacuum in place in relation to the treatment of personal data by the US authorities, seriously prejudicing the European public and the air carriers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, therefore, necessary to repeat our position, which is already well known. We also believe, naturally, that this agreement can be improved but also that the fight against terrorism and cooperation with third countries in the field, with the United States in this case, is a priority for the European Union. Furthermore, Mr President, we need the agreement now and, in any event, there will always be the possibility of referring the matter to the Court of Justice at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like, Mr President, to take up Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal that we listen to what Commissioner Patten says to us tomorrow afternoon with regard to the agreement and delay the vote scheduled for tomorrow morning. I would ask that this request be considered, since I believe it to be very reasonable, and, in any event, I would ask that the vote we were going to hold tomorrow on prior referral to the Court of Justice be delayed until the day after tomorrow, when we have heard the Commission’s speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of you have remarked how several different committees and resolutions over recent weeks and months have indicated the probability of going to the Court of Justice, of which I have been aware as I have keenly followed the issue. However, the event which triggered the referral to the Court was the letter of last Wednesday afternoon, which I received from Mr Gargani on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. This is the first time I have had the duty and opportunity, as President, to look into the question.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the exchange of views, I propose that we proceed to the debate in substance tomorrow. We will hear what Commissioner Patten has to say, along with the opinions of different colleagues. In the light of all the available information, the vote will take place at noon on Wednesday. That brings us to within 24 hours of our ultimate deadline in terms of our right to refer to the Court, so we are still working within the time limits that apply here.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the volume of business this week, we have added an extra sitting tonight. I suggest that those colleagues who wish to make a 'one-minute speech' submit what they wanted to say in writing, and I will try to follow up on their comments. For anyone who insists on speaking, the Rules provide that the item can be taken later in the sitting. I therefore propose to take the item at the end of business this evening, rather than at this stage.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
