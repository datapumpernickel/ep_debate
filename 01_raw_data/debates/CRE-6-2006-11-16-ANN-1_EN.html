<p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has presented a report emphasising that there is a need to introduce a total ban on cod fishing in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and Kattegat during 2007. The Swedish Board of Fisheries gives its backing to the report and maintains that a total ban is essential if cod stocks are to recover. Criticism has also been levelled at the current quota system. The Swedish Fishermen's Federation and the recently appointed Swedish Minister for Fisheries advocate fishing days rather than fish quotas. At the present time, large quantities of cod are thrown overboard in order to comply with the quota rules.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>The situation regarding cod stocks in the areas which the honourable Member mentions has been a matter of concern for all relevant parties for many years now, and has resulted in several measures being adopted to restrict fishing. Although there are some positive signs in sight, more work is clearly needed for cod stocks to recover to a sustainable level in the long term. The measures introduced so far have been the North Sea cod recovery plan, reducing annual quotas, increasing net mesh size, fishing ban zones, fishing ban times, especially the spawning season, and lowering the number of fishing days.</p>
<p>The Council will be taking a decision on the Commission’s proposal for the annual management of cod fishing. Towards the end of November, the Commission is expected to put forward a proposal, based on opinions submitted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which endorses Total Allowable Catches (TACs), quotas and other measures relating to the issue for the year 2007. Consequently, the Council cannot say what this proposal will consist of or how the Member States will react to it.</p>
<p>The Presidency proposes to steer discussions, on what is normally a troublesome subject, with the positive and constructive aim of reaching a decision at the Council sitting in December.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0916"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency, which is binding neither on the Council nor its Members, was not given orally during Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's November 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Preventing and combating smoking is already a priority health-policy objective in the Member States and the European Community.</p>
<p>In its recommendation of 2 December 2002 on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Council notes that, given the health risks associated with passive smoking, Member States should aim to protect smokers and non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke. The Council recommends that the Member States should:</p>
<p>enact or implement legislation and/or other effective measures to protect people from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, enclosed public places and public transport;</p>
<p>continue to develop strategies and measures to reduce tobacco consumption, such as strengthening overall health education, peculiarly in schools, and general programmes to discourage the initial use of tobacco products and to help people overcome tobacco addiction.</p>
<p>The recommendation calls on the Commission to report on the implementation of the proposed measures, on the basis of information supplied by the Member States. The report to be submitted in 2007 will assess the effectiveness of the measures set out in the recommendation and the need for further measures.</p>
<p>The aim of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which came into force on 27 February 2005, is to protect current and future generations against tobacco consumption and prevent environmental pollution through tobacco use. The Commission and all the Member States with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic have ratified the Framework Convention, which lays down a specific obligation, binding on the parties, requiring them to protect people against exposure to tobacco smoke. Pursuant to Article 8 of the Framework Convention, each contracting party must enact and implement effective measures providing for protection from passive smoking in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.</p>
<p>At the first conference of the contracting parties to the Framework Convention, held in Geneva in February 2006, the Community and its Member States made a significant contribution to the discussion of the decision on the framing of guidelines for the implementation of the Framework Convention as regards protection from passive smoking. A start has now been made on drawing up the guidelines, which will specify all the factors fundamental to the implementation of Article 8.</p>
<p>It is solely a matter for the competent Member State authorities to enact measures such as a ban on smoking or the provision of counselling programmes for people who give up smoking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>The Council’s objective remains a safer Europe in a more just world. The European security strategy adopted in December 2003 set out the means by which the EU seeks to attain this objective.</p>
<p>As regards the examples cited by the Honourable Member, the Council can reply as follows:</p>
<p>Iraq</p>
<p>The European Union continues to support the government of national unity headed by Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in implementing its programme, including the government’s proposed national reconciliation and dialogue plan. The EU is actively involved in drafting the International Compact together with the Iraqi government, the UN and other partners in the international community. This compact is an important opportunity for the Iraqi government to commit itself to difficult but necessary reforms in the political, security and economic fields and for the international community to commit itself to supporting these reforms.</p>
<p>The European Union supported Iraq’s referendum on elections and the constitution and intends to support the democracy process in Iraq in future too. The EU is continuing with its comprehensive aid programme supported by Iraq and has also continued, at Iraq’s request, with its Integrated Rule of Law mission for Iraq (EUJUST LEX). Thanks to this mission, training in the Rule of Law has so far been given to some 800 Iraqi police officers, judges and prison officers. There are plans to begin negotiations in the near future on a trade and cooperation agreement with Iraq. The EU’s close political dialogue with Iraq is also continuing.</p>
<p>Iran</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its readiness to develop sustainable long-term relations with Iran and has always supported efforts towards a diplomatic solution on the issue of Iran’s nuclear power.<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The deadline of 31 July 2006 set in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 has passed, and the EU has expressed its deep concern at the fact that Iran has still not yet halted its uranium enrichment activities.</p>
<p>In his contacts with the Iranian authorities, the EU’s High Representative has continually called on Iran to put into practice the measures referred to in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and demanded by the IAEA Administrative Council.</p>
<p>Iran has not as yet shown any willingness to comply with the demand to halt its uranium enrichment activities. Halting such activities is a precondition for the negotiations, supported by the EU, for a new initiative on the basis of the offer made by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and the USA.</p>
<p>In its resolution 1696 the Security Council expressed its intention to adopt appropriate measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter if Iran does not comply with its demands. The Council considered that the fact that Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities leaves the EU no choice but to support consultations on such measures.</p>
<p>However, on 17 October the Council noted that Iran still has the option to negotiate and strongly urged Iran to choose the positive course of action proposed.</p>
<p>On 6 June 2006 the EU’s High Representative set out to Iran the proposals of six states (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the Russian Federation and the USA). These far-reaching proposals would serve as the basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran all it needed to develop a modern civilian nuclear energy sector, while also taking account of international concerns.</p>
<p>Opting for such a positive course of action would pave the way for new relations with Iran, based on mutual respect and wider cooperation in the political and economic spheres.</p>
<p>North Korea</p>
<p>When the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea proclaimed a nuclear test, the Council strongly condemned, in its conclusions adopted on 17 October on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the test of a nuclear explosive device, which it considered poses a danger to regional stability and represents a clear threat to international peace and security. It indicated that the EU will fully implement the provisions of all relevant UNSC Resolutions and notably of Resolution 1718 (2006) and of Resolution 1695 (2006).</p>
<p>The sanctions set out in the UN Security Council’s resolution include a ban on the export of sensitive products and sensitive technology which might promote North Korea’s nuclear-related, other weapons of mass destruction-related and ballistic missile-related programmes, and a ban on supplying services relating thereto, a ban on the procurement of sensitive products and sensitive technology from North Korea, a ban on the export of luxury goods and a freeze on the funds and economic resources of persons, communities and bodies which participate in or support the above-mentioned North Korean programmes.</p>
<p>In its conclusions the Council also called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to return immediately to the six-party negotiations.</p>
<p>The Presidency later expressed its satisfaction at the fact that China, the Democratic Republic of Korea and the USA had reached a consensus in Beijing on 31 October on holding a meeting in the near future in the context of the six-party negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 18 July, the Commission put forward a proposal in accordance with the provisions of the current Postal Services Directive 97/67/EC<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC, for a Directive of the European Parliament and Council concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. On 20 October 2006, the Council received the proposal in question, a Commission report on the application of the Postal Directive<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Commission’s prospective study on the impact on universal service of the full accomplishment of the postal internal market in 2009<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Furthermore, with regard to its Communication entitled ‘Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs in the European Union’<a href="#defann_8_5" name="refann_8_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, the Commission conducted an Impact Assessment <a href="#defann_8_6" name="refann_8_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and submitted it to the European Parliament and the Council. This sheds light on the economic and social effects of different options on users and all relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Commission only put the proposal forward a short time ago, so the Council has only just started looking at it. It would be premature at this stage to adopt a position on the details in the proposal or to comment on the documents annexed to it without it pre-empting the outcome of the discussions on the subject in the Council over the months to come.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>In the Council’s opinion, the conflict in Western Sahara continues to be a major barrier to stability, cooperation and prosperity in the region. The Council is convinced that more effective cooperation in the Maghreb countries would benefit them, and it has urged them to work to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Council fully supports the attempts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum to achieve a solution to the West Saharan conflict that is just, lasting and acceptable to both sides. It would give the people of the Western Sahara the right to self-determination under, for example, the most recent Security Council Regulation 1720, passed on 31 October 2006.</p>
<p>The Council has encouraged the parties to try and reach such a solution and act to bring it about in constructive, flexible cooperation with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has reminded Morocco and Algeria that one of the aims of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the enhancement of good neighbourly relations to prevent and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>The Council has always focussed close attention on the humanitarian aspects of the conflict in Western Sahara. The Council has been actively involved in these issues, and has urged the parties to implement more concrete measures to resolve the remaining humanitarian problems. The Council has also said that it is worried about alleged human rights violations in Western Sahara and in the camps at Tindouf, and has put forward official contacts for the parties to address this issue.</p>
<p>The Western Sahara issue is regularly discussed at meetings under the EU-Morocco Association Agreement. The Council made special mention of the issue at the end of 2005 at the Reinforced Political Dialogue meeting on 9 November 2005 and the fifth meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council on 22 November 2005. The Council again discussed the matter at a meeting of the Association Committee on 17 November this year, and also intends to do so at the Reinforced Political Dialogue meeting in mid-December.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0952"></a>

<p>The new legally binding instrument should provide relations between us with a lasting and comprehensive framework.</p>
<p>This new agreement should also cover opportunities for greater trade and economic integration after Russia has acceded to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Neither party to the agreement will disassociate itself from the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement before the new framework takes effect, in order to avoid a legally unregulated state of affairs.</p>

<p>(FR) The role of decent work in reducing poverty and of the need to step up efforts to promote decent work via development cooperation have benefited from increased recognition. This recognition can be seen both in the Commission communication entitled ‘Promoting decent work for all’ and in the European consensus for development (2005), which enshrines employment and social cohesion, including decent work, as one of the newest areas of Community action. These issues also form an integral part of the EU’s strategy for Africa, of cooperation with Latin America and of action plans in the context of cooperation between the EC and partner countries covered by the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p>The Commission is already funding some programmes in support of decent work or aspects thereof in different partner regions and countries.</p>
<p>These programmes are based, inter alia, on support for enhancing vocational training with a view to increasing the opportunities for job seekers to find decent work, support for social action funds for local development, which assist vulnerable communities, support for social integration, revenue generation and the economic reintegration of vulnerable sections of society such as displaced persons, demobilised soldiers and indigenous peoples. In spite of this, employment, social cohesion and decent work were not covered by most of the external cooperation programmes and projects for the 2000-2006 period.</p>
<p>The Commission does not, however, grant independent funding for each of the fields in which we cooperate with our partner countries and this applies to issues relating to decent work. Our cooperation works on the principle of national ownership and we must respect our partner countries’ choices as regards their priorities for cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p>The programming process of the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) has not yet been concluded and accordingly we do not have definitive information on the distribution of appropriations between the different priority areas. That being the case, we do not have specific information on appropriations for promoting decent work.</p>
<p>At a more advanced stage are the programming of our cooperation with non-ACP (African, Caribbean, Pacific) countries – as in the case of Latin America, Asia and Central Asia, for example – and the European neighbourhood policy. It would be premature, however, even here, to offer definitive figures on specific financial appropriations, given that the final version of strategy documents on these countries and regions has yet to be drawn up. The Member States and Parliament will also have their say on the content of these documents before their adoption in the dialogue between the institutions provided for on such matters.</p>
<p>In addition to programming per country, the thematic programme ‘Investing in human resources’ will, starting in 2007, finance innovation, worldwide partnerships and practical measures in key areas of human and social development, including decent work. In this area, too, funding has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Support can also be granted to the social partners from 2007, in the context of the thematic programme entitled ‘non-state actors and local authorities in development policy’. Furthermore, aid can be earmarked to promote core labour standards due to the new European instrument for democracy and human rights. Support for initiatives aimed at improving the management of economic migration for the benefit of both countries of origin and host countries will also contribute towards promoting decent work. Such support is provided for by the Aeneas programme and will be available from 2007 within the 'migration and asylum' programme.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to highlight the fact that, far from being a simple matter of employment or social protection, decent work is, more than anything, a matter of ‘governance’. The implementation of effective policies aimed at decent work requires well-managed institutions, so that decent work can be promoted effectively.</p>
<p>This is why, in the tenth EDF, the Commission proposed the granting of an incentive tranche, which will be linked to our partner countries’ programme, on a series of governance-related issues, including the signing and ratification of the eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation. The Commission is convinced that this key initiative will play an important role in promoting decent work in the partner countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0880"></a>

<p>(FR) Around 2.2 million people, mostly children, die each year in the developing world from diseases associated with a lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene. This is one of the main causes of sickness and death in developing countries.</p>
<p>Not only is the EU the biggest provider of development aid among donor countries, but it is also the biggest provider of development aid for water and sanitation, with an annual budget of around € 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2005 the Commission committed € 1 283 million to water and sanitation for developing countries. The figures for 2006 are not yet known and those for the period prior to 2002 are not comparable. The Commission estimates that approximately 25% of these sums are intended for sanitation.</p>
<p>The Commission prepares and carries out its water and sanitation activities in the context of strategy papers and national and regional indicative programmes. These documents are drawn up in consultation with the partner countries and reflect the national priorities and requirements of the aid beneficiaries. New country strategy papers are being drawn up in partnership with the beneficiary countries, which will cover financing from the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) and the EU budget (2007-2012). Details of new commitments are not yet available.</p>
<p>The second part of the question relates to the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership on Water and Sanitation, signed by African and European heads of state at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and implemented via the African component of the European Water Initiative.</p>
<p>The EU’s Water Initiative is not a financial instrument for providing aid. It is a concerted effort on the part of the Commission, Member States, partner countries and other relevant parties, including civil society organisations and local governments, to work together to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The effects of the initiative have been slow in coming, but a number of significant achievements have nevertheless been made:</p>
<p>- the initiative has established dialogues between the partner country governments, the relevant parties and the EU with a view to helping partner countries develop and implement policies, strategies and priorities for water and sanitation which donors can support; there has been slow progress and some success in developing these dialogues. By stressing the broad participation of civil society they have provided an opportunity for African civil organisations to be heard;</p>
<p>- the initiative has developed activities for coordinating donors in order to help improve aid effectiveness (notably in Ethiopia);</p>
<p>- the initiative has launched five regional cross-border water management projects in Africa;</p>
<p>- the ACP-EU Water Facility, set up in 2004 with total funding of € 500 million from the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, is a direct result of the political impetus generated by the European Water Initiative and a reflection of the importance which the EU attaches to water and sanitation;</p>
<p>- the European Water Initiative has helped to strengthen the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and facilitate participation by AMCOW in the political debate on water at regional and international level;</p>
<p>- the contribution from the Commission’s 6<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme to the objectives of the European initiative has led to the creation of more than 50 new research projects, for which the Commission’s combined contribution is approximately € 28 million. A good example is the SWITCH project (Sustainable Water management Improves Tomorrow’s Cities’ Health), which will receive over € 14 million (€ 14 749 997) from the Commission spread over five years. This project tackles sanitation problems in various parts of the world based on specific case studies carried out in a number of cities in the developing world, including Bogota, Cali, Lima, Belo Horizonte, Accra, Alexandria and Beijing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0884"></a>

<p>(FR) Civil society has a crucial role to play in the process of drawing up country strategy papers because of its twin calling as an essential player in aid provision and as a strategic partner capable of advancing political, economic and social dialogue. The Commission is alive to this and must play a significant role by facilitating constructive and ongoing interaction between national public authorities and a broad range of civil society organisations - a fundamental factor in a country’s development and for enabling all sections of the population to take ownership of development strategies.</p>
<p>Under the 9th European Development Fund (EDF), civil society in African, Caribbean and pacific countries (ACP countries) has participated in the programming process for the first time. Two Commission reports have assessed the progress made in fostering participatory approaches: the first focused on civil society participation in drawing up country strategy papers for the ACP states (2003); the second was drawn up during the mid-term review of country strategy papers. For the second report, various tools were used to obtain information on best practices. In particular, a detailed country-specific questionnaire was sent to regional desk officers and chiefly covered the following aspects: the national context, civil society participation in discussions on what policy should be followed and on policy implementation, the use of resources allocated for capacity building for non-state actors (NSA), the degree and quality of NSA participation and overall trends concerning that participation. In addition to the Commission’s in-house information sources (joint annual reports, analysis of conclusions of mid-term reviews, and funding proposals and agreements), use was made of other documentation, including assessments by social and economic partners, questionnaires and assessments from the ACP-EU Follow-Up Committee of at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and other, very useful documentary and field studies carried out by civil society organisations.</p>
<p>Our willingness to foster the participation and ownership principles has also been incorporated as one of the basic tenets of the programming exercise, currently under way, for the 10th EDF. The programming orientations put this as follows:</p>
<p>‘Consultation with local authorities and non state actors is an essential feature of the exercise. They should be involved at different stages of the programming process and in particular be given the possibility of contributing to and commenting upon the CSP/RSP<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.’</p>
<p>To ensure that all partners involved in the programming process can participate fully, the orientations have been shared with them and posted on the Internet. The guidelines also state that NSA are ‘eligible for financial support under the (Cotonou) agreement’ and that strategy papers must ‘provide information on the use of EDF resources to foster the emergence of NSA and the development of their capacities’.</p>
<p>National parliaments, being guarantors of democratic legitimacy, must play a major role in promoting sound public management in the ACP-EU partnership context, in particular via the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The Commission, through the ongoing dialogue it maintains with partner authorities and regions, encourages, at various levels, the maximum possible involvement of institutions, especially parliaments. This positive approach is reflected in a number of strategy documents, including the revised Cotonou Agreement and the ‘European Consensus on Development’, which acknowledges the essential oversight role of citizens’ democratically elected representatives, particularly within national assemblies, parliaments and local authorities. Each ACP country is free to determine the best way of involving and informing its national parliament, however, and it is not for the Commission to take specific measures to adopt practical arrangements in this connection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission takes very seriously the risk that the budgetary aid it provides may not achieve the goal of improving the quantity and quality of the services provided to the neediest.</p>
<p>In order to curb this risk, the Commission has developed an innovative, results-based approach, establishing a link between the sums paid out and the results obtained through a set of indicators approved by the country concerned that make it possible to check whether there has been a genuine improvement in public social services (vaccination or schooling of young girls, for example).</p>
<p>In order to achieve a greater impact among the neediest sections of the population, some programmes set objectives which are based not on national averages, but refer to the least favoured regions, where access to basic services in more problematic. This is the case in Mali, for example, where budgetary support is given for decentralisation through the Programme to support Administrative Reform and Decentralisation (PARAD).</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission prefers to transfer funds directly to national treasuries, rather than to local authorities, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Given that such transfers would entail a change in the distribution of resources compared to the original state budget, by so doing the Commission would reduce its partner's control over budgetary policy, while at the same time affecting its system of public finance management, thereby weakening the tools needed to strengthen the State in order to develop coherent regional development policies, which are often lacking for want of resources.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and more realistically, paying budgetary aid directly to local authorities might well prompt the central authorities to change the way they distribute resources to local authorities, by deducting the resources provided by the EC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given that the national budget includes transfers to local authorities, these transfers, like other expenditure included in the budget, will benefit from budgetary support. This is the case, for example, with budgetary aid provided to Honduras to support decentralisation and Jordan to promote local development.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission has different ways of including the local dimension in its budget support programmes:</p>
<p>By including the monitoring of budget transfers to local authorities among the subjects discussed during annual reviews, as part of the dialogue with governments, or even in some cases by setting conditions for the granting of budget support.</p>
<p>By introducing sectoral budget support, particularly in the education and health sectors, incorporating the decentralisation process, as has been done in Nicaragua or the Philippines, for example.</p>
<p>By backing up budget support with capacity-building for central, decentralised and local services responsible for the management of public finances.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0937"></a>

<p>(FR) The answer to this question can be split into two parts:</p>
<p>1. How to take account of isolation in the allocation of funding among countries;</p>
<p>2. How to ensure that those without a voice are taken into account in each country’s national programming.</p>
<p>The answer to each of these sub-questions can be found in the European Consensus on the Union’s development policy.</p>
<p>1. Criteria for the allocation of funding:</p>
<p>The European Consensus states that development resources should be allocated in an objective and transparent way, based on the needs and performance of the beneficiary countries. It tries to define the concept of poverty according to criteria of needs, such as the level of access to basic education and water, infant mortality or the degree of malnutrition.</p>
<p>In addition to these general indicators there are indicators of social cohesion. For the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, in accordance with the ACP-EC partnership agreement the characteristics of landlocked or island territories are explicitly taken into account in the allocation of aid. To these are added other criteria of isolation, such as the relative cost of transport compared with the principal external markets and the ratio between the size of the territory and the non-urban population, in order to take account of the additional costs involved in ensuring basic social services for the populations farthest away from urban centres.</p>
<p>2. The programming process</p>
<p>The European Consensus points out that in addition to allocating funds among countries the primary objective of EU development cooperation is the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Strategy Papers make a detailed analysis of the problems of poverty and the responses proposed by our partner countries so as to be able to propose response strategies in order to make an effective contribution to reducing poverty. Indicators of the performance of cooperation will be identified in order to make it possible to monitor the progress made in this field.</p>
<p>In order to achieve significant and lasting results, the European Consensus also insists on more structured cooperation using a sectoral approach rather than a project-based approach, so as to ensure that our measures are part of a global development strategy.</p>
<p>The representatives of non-State actors are involved in the programming process, and coordination between stakeholders, including other donors, should ensure that no vulnerable group is overlooked in the programming process.</p>
<p>The identification of conflict-prevention and regional planning, including support for decentralisation processes and local development, as integral parts of our cooperation priorities should also ensure that the problems of minorities and the neediest populations can be taken into account fully in the implementation of cooperation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the instrument for human rights (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights - EIDHR) and the thematic programme ‘Non-state actors and Local Authorities in Development’ will help the Commission to tackle specific problems in contexts other than cooperation with governments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0950"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission is one of the biggest donors of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees living in camps in South West Algeria. Since 1993, EUR 117 million has been earmarked for meeting the refugees’ needs.</p>
<p>Aid granted in the tax year 2006 has totalled EUR 10.9 million, an increase on the EUR 9 311 000 in aid granted in the 2005 budget. Two financial decisions have been adopted. The first was in February 2006 to address the emergency caused by flooding that affected the camps (EUR 900 000) and the second in July 2006 to respond to recurring human needs as of September 2006 (EUR 10 million).</p>
<p>The Commission’s aid is aimed first and foremost at responding to the refugees’ food requirements, via, on the one hand, funding from the World Food Programme (WFP) for basic food commodities, and on the other hand funding from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for supplying fresh produce. This twin approach will help to meet the refugees’ basic food needs, as well as diversifying what they eat, with vitamins and micronutrients. This will also be something of a response to the recommendations contained in the UN High Commission for Refugees / WFP nutritional study of 2005, which highlighted a deterioration in the refugees' nutritional situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Commission aid is aimed at improving the refugees' living conditions from a multisectoral perspective. Within the framework of the 2006 funding decision, which covers the last third of 2006 and much of 2007 – in addition to food aid, which accounts for half of the finance – support for NGO projects and UN agencies has been planned in a number of areas, including: the distribution of hygiene kits (for women), distribution of tents, support for the health system, waste management, water supply, activities for school-age children and the handicapped, and vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to providing humanitarian aid, the Commission intends to use its permanent presence in Algiers and its regular visits to the camps to ensure that the projects it finances are monitored, ongoing needs assessments are carried out and aid efforts undertaken by the different donor organisations are coordinated. In this regard, the Commission is aware of the critical situation of the WFP’s ‘food pipeline’, which has led to emergency appeals from a number of organisations. Nevertheless, the Commission has since become aware of a number of contributions from donors to the WFP, ensuring that basic food needs are covered until the end of 2006. There may be some logistical difficulties in transporting the food products for November 2006 distribution. The Commission feels that there is no point in adopting special emergency measures but that humanitarian aid must continue to be implemented, as provided for by the 2006 funding decision, in order to prevent further setbacks in the delivery of aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0907"></a>

<p>If Ryanair were to take over Aer Lingus, does this mean that the European Commission would look carefully at the effect that such a takeover would have for the individual Irish market, considering that both these airlines control in excess of 80% of all airline travel between the Republic of Ireland and Britain?</p>

The “Community dimension” is determined in accordance with Articles 1(2) and 1(3) of the Merger Regulation on the basis of turnover of the undertakings concerned. Where a concentration fulfils the relevant turnover threshold criteria, it has to be notified to the Commission prior to its implementation.</p>
<p>The proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair was formally notified to the Commission on 30 October 2006. This is, however, without prejudice to the necessary assessment of whether the transaction falls under the Commission's jurisdiction, which can only be done on the basis of the detailed turnover figures for both parties.</p>
<p>If the proposed transaction falls within the Commission's jurisdiction, an extensive market investigation would be launched in order to assess carefully the effects of the concentration on competition, in particular with regard to a number of routes connecting Ireland with other European countries, including the United Kingdom. The investigation would also examine the position of the proposed combined entity in Ireland and in particular at the Dublin airport.

<p>(EN) Consumer price inflation in Greece as measured by the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) has been for some years now among the highest in the euro-zone. However, a structural gap between producer and consumer prices cannot be observed, since for the last two years (i.e. comparing August 2006 with September 2004) the index of producer prices and the HICP for Greece differed on average by only two index points. Over the same period consumer prices for energy in Greece increased by around 30%, while consumer prices excluding energy increased by 3%.</p>
<p>More generally, it should be clearly noted that price increases can depend on various factors and are not always the result of anti-competitive practices.</p>
<p>To the extent that an increase in consumer prices for a product or service in the territory of a Member State is the consequence of anticompetitive practices that violate the EC competition rules, these can be pursued by the national competition authority, by private plaintiffs before national courts or by the Commission. Very often, the national competition authority will be well placed to deal with such cases. Consistency in the enforcement of EC competition rules is ensured in the framework of the European Competition Network. If ever the situation arose where there was a serious risk that EC competition law would be improperly or inadequately applied, the Commission has the power to relieve the national competition authority concerned of the competence to deal with the case. To date, such a case has never arisen in practice.</p>
<p>The Commission has received no indication to suggest that the Greek competition authority and the Greek independent regulatory commissions are not cooperating properly in the execution of their tasks. Recent developments in Greek competition law have provided the Greek competition authority with stronger enforcement powers that should enable it to further step up enforcement against infringements of competition law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0938"></a>

<p>(EN) The Preliminary Report of the Commission's sector inquiry into competition in gas markets confirmed that the majority of long-term contracts link the price for gas to the price of oil or oil derivatives. Gas prices were also found to be indexed, although to a lesser extent, to prices of gas traded at hubs, coal prices, electricity prices and general inflation indices.</p>
<p>The linking of oil and natural gas prices is based on the assumption that natural gas can be substituted for oil. Gas-to-gas competition, where prices are based solely upon the supply and demand for gas, would provide the market with more efficient pricing mechanisms. The Commission is therefore taking steps to promote the development of gas to gas competition within a competitive internal gas market.</p>
<p>Natural gas was first introduced into the Greek energy market in November 1996. Greece holds exemptions from certain provisions of the Gas Directive as an emergent market under Article 28 paragraph 2 of that Directive. As a result the majority of the provisions of the Gas Directive will only be applicable in Greece from 15 November 2006.</p>
<p>In December 2005, Greece adopted law 3428 transposing the entirety of the Gas Directive. The Greek Authorities are currently drafting secondary measures to promote the development of a well-functioning and mature natural gas market and the Commission is monitoring these developments carefully.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0876"></a>

<p>(EN) The marketing authorisation for a novel vaccine against cervical cancer by the Commission in September 2006 is an important step in the prevention of cancer.</p>
<p>Based on today’s burden of cervical cancer, estimates indicate that about 32,000 cancers in women could be prevented by this vaccine.</p>
<p>Considering that today several hundred thousand women per year in EU 25 are diagnosed with advanced precancerous lesions, which have to be clinically treated, the positive impact of a vaccine which could prevent 80% of these lesions could be enormous.</p>
<p>In this situation, the Commission will move on several fronts in helping to identify best practice, in addressing evidence gaps by research and development under the future 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme and in updating and promoting the European Code against cancer, which since 2003 contains a recommendation on primary prevention of liver cancer by vaccination against the Hepatitis B virus.</p>
<p>This will further include the publication and promotion of the EU guidelines on quality assurance in cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. The guidelines are expected to appear in the first half of 2007. They will discuss Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing and vaccination in special chapters.</p>
<p>In addition, a new proposal to update the EU guidelines on quality assurance in breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnosis has been selected for financing under the health programme 2003-2008. This will address HPV vaccination with priority.</p>
<p>The European Cancer Network will be asked to extend its implementation and impact report to include a detailed analysis of the expected impact of HPV vaccination on the prevention of cervical cancer and on best practice in screening.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to covering needs for information and consultation in the new Member States, Acceeding and Candidate countries and to integrating their relevant experts.</p>
<p>This will ensure that knowledge and motivation will grow for an efficient implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening and the related EU guidelines in all Member States.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission considers inviting a group of experts from the two networks, from the World Health Organisation/International Agency for Research on Cancer, and from Member States and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to assess the status quo and possible ways forward.</p>
<p>Preventing health risks in order to maintain a healthy and competitive labour force is part of the recently adopted strategic guidelines for cohesion policy 2007-2013, in particular in the convergence regions. The objective is to increase the number of healthy years at work and maintain an active participation in society of as many people as possible. This includes ensuring that health services have the necessary skills, products and equipment to prevent risks and minimise their potential damage. Actions will cover both health infrastructure and training of health professionals. In addition, actions aimed at health promotion, disease prevention and transfer of knowledge will be supported.</p>
<p>Cervical cancer has to be tackled. And best practice examples show that significant results can be obtained.</p>
<p>A coherent, collaborative approach is needed, notably covering the new aspect of vaccination against this cancer.</p>
<p>The action is principally for the Member States, but the EU can and will provide support, as in the case of research and cohesion policies where possible.</p>

<p>(EN) In September 2006 the Commission together with Member State experts, carried out a mission to Lebanon to assess the damages. The mission collected extensive data via 450 standardised fiches and questionnaires covering more than 100 locations. Field visits were carried out to these locations. The assessment covered damages to public assets and infrastructure, in the fields of transport (roads and bridges), water, energy, health and education. The mission focused its field visits on the most damaged districts, Tyre, Bint Jbeil, Marjayoun, Natbatyeh and Baabda; mainly in Southern Lebanon, as well as to Beqaa.</p>
<p>For the sectors targeted by the mission, the direct costs of damage to public infrastructure were estimated at €83 million. This estimation made by the EU team is broadly 1/3 of the estimates already presented by other sources, including those of the Government. This is for a number of reasons. In particular, the assessment covered only the main sectors of public infrastructure. Furthermore the focus was on direct damage (rehabilitation and replacement cost) whereas other estimates could include pre-existing needs or site redevelopment. The price estimates by the EU team also reflect market prices in an after-war situation, whereas the previous price estimations reflected higher prices applicable during the war.</p>
<p>An assessment of damages to private housing was not a core part of the mission; however, estimates from other sources indicate the damage to private housing ranges from broadly €800 million to €1.4 billion; also lower that the initial estimates.</p>
<p>Follow-up missions are being undertaken to assess how the Commission can reorient the funding already available and for future assistance. As far as the Commission is aware, Israel has not indicated any intention to currently bear any cost related to the reconstruction of Lebanon.</p>
<p>The Commission considers it vital, particularly in a crisis, to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open with all Euro-Mediterranean partners. Therefore, the Commission is not considering taking sanctions like those suggested which would likely affect negatively the EU's influence in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0882"></a>

<p>The anti-dumping duty on leather shoes from China and Vietnam which was introduced last April does not seem, according to figures from Eurostat, to have brought about a significant fall in imports which are now instead coming from other Asian countries. How does the Commission view this trend? The Commission has not yet produced the specific findings of its anti-dumping survey - nothing but a few generally worded documents. Will it announce these findings and publish its analyses of the consequences that the anti-dumping duty has had and will have for European consumers and businesses, including those that own factories in China and Vietnam?

<p>(EN) On 5 October 2006, the Council adopted the measures proposed by the Commission to tackle the dumping of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear in the European Union.</p>
<p>The full findings of the investigation as well as the details of how the level of dumping and injury to the EU industry were established and the appropriate level of duties determined in this case are set out in detail in Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006 of 5 October 2006<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These measures offer a balanced solution in a complex case, because free trade means also fair trade; a solution responding to the clear evidence of unfair competitive practices and State intervention, which would not be allowed under EC competition law and which has enabled Chinese and Vietnamese companies to engage in dumping in the European Union.</p>
<p>A comprehensive impact assessment analysis of the measures on consumers in the EC market was carried out. In all likelihood there will be no, or only a marginal effect of the duties on consumer prices, because there is a huge mark up between the import prices of shoes and the prices paid by consumers. Indeed, average import price of the footwear is around €8,5. A duty of 10% on this price is only €0,85 while consumers pay prices of between €50 and €130. There is thus sufficient space for the duty to be absorbed within the distribution chain.</p>
<p>No statistical data are available about the number of European companies in the footwear sector which have directly invested in manufacturing sites in China and Vietnam. Though the footwear case has shown that some European enterprises indeed have set up own production facilities in East Asia, outsourcing in the form of subcontracting to independent Asian manufacturers appears to be more common. In fact, none of the thirteen sampled Chinese exporting producers or any of the sampled eight Vietnamese companies in the footwear investigation was owned by European companies.</p>
<p>As indicated in recital 325 of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping measures in the footwear case import trends following the imposition of measures are subject to an import surveillance system. Such system has already been in place since the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures in April 2006. These data are available in the public domain. In addition, the development of retail prices in the footwear sector is under constant monitoring as well.</p>
<p>It is not a key objective of anti-dumping measures to block imports, such measures are not quantitative restrictions, but only serve to redress unfair pricing strategies. Given that in the case at hand measures are only in place for a relatively short period of time, and in particular due to their gradual phase- in it would be premature to identify already at this stage unambiguous impact trends of the measures on import flows. The Commission will continue monitoring this issue. However, it should be mentioned that Vietnam has increased its footwear exports to the United States of America according to press reports. It is not envisaged to automatically follow up with public reports, unless unexpected circumstances and developments call for further reflection in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Indeed, the envisaged duration of these measures is set for two years only. The measures offer a balanced solution in a complex case; a solution responding to the clear evidence of unfair competitive practices and State intervention which has enabled Chinese and Vietnamese companies to engage in dumping in the European Union.</p>
<p>No evidence exists that the measures in place could lead to dramatic job losses in China and Vietnam. In fact, the dimension of this case needs to be put into perspective. Only around 18 % of the total import volume of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear of all types to the EC is now covered by measures, i.e. only certain leather footwear not including e.g. high tech sport shoes ("STAF") is concerned. Clearly, China and Vietnam will continue to have ample opportunity to supply EC consumers with their shoes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the footwear industry is not only important for China and Vietnam. In this context it might be worth to recall that with some 200.000 employees in the EC manufacturing footwear, often in regions with little alternative sources for employment, this sector plays an important role for the European economy as well. EU footwear producers are world wide renowned for their design, know how and quality production. Unfair trading practices, targeted to undermine their competitive edge, are not acceptable.</p>
<p>A rigorous and comprehensive impact assessment analysis of the measures on consumers in the EC market was carried out.

<p>The European Coordinator for the Transeuropean Transport Network's priority project No 16 has stated that the planned tunnel under the Vignemale Massif will have to wait for the implementation of the two high-speed lines between Spain and France which come under priority project No 3. However, a careful reading of the report drawn up by project No 3's Coordinator, Étienne Davignon, indicates that the Atlantic section (Irún/Hendaye-Dax) will not be finished before 2015 or even 2020. Greater progress has been made on the Mediterranean section (Figueras-Perpignan), and its completion is scheduled for 2009 and not 2010, although the Coordinator is aware that there are fresh delays.</p>

<p>(FR) The completion dates in the report by Mr Davignon, who is the European coordinator for priority axis No 3, the ‘High-speed axis of South West Europe’, were supplied by the national authorities responsible for this area. The cross-border section Figueras-Perpignan is scheduled to open in 2009. As regards the completion of the Irún/Hendaye-Dax cross-border link, on the Atlantic section of this axis, the probable date is 2020 – though this has yet to be officially confirmed – which corresponds to what is indicated in Annex III of the decision on Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) guidelines (Decision No 884/2004).</p>
<p>The Commission is unable to specify at this stage with any great accuracy the date for work to begin on Priority project No 16, the 'new high-capacity rail crossing in the Pyrenees’. Aside from the fact that this is the responsibility of the Member States concerned, the Commission’s experience in following up major TEN-T infrastructure demonstrates that several years of very detailed preliminary studies are required before detailed planning is done. In the case of this project, these studies have yet to be completed, which also explains why Decision No 884/2004 does not indicate the implementation date of the project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0888"></a>

<p>(EN) There are two basic ways of importing garlic fraudulently:</p>
<p>misdescription of origin, and</p>
<p>more recently, misdescription of the product.</p>
<p>In order to fight against the first method, the Commission introduced two measures:</p>
<p>- Further to OLAF’s<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> operational activities, a 'Notice to importers' was published in August 2005 in the "C" series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in which Community operators were advised to take all necessary precautions against this kind of fraud.</p>
<p>- Since January 2006, all imports of garlic are subject to the issue of an import licence.</p>
<p>As a result, the incidence of this kind of fraud has decreased: imports from third countries other than Argentina and China during January-June 2006 were 75% of the imports during the same period in 2005, and 65% of the average imports of the same period from 2001 to 2005.</p>
<p>Due to its nature, the second kind of fraud is more difficult to tackle. The Commission would like to emphasise the responsibility of the Member States' customs authorities in this particular context, because the only way to really combat this kind of fraud is physical control upon importation.</p>
<p>It should also be emphasised, that there seem to be no major disturbances on the European garlic market since 2001. On the contrary, it even seems to be improving.</p>
<p>To sum up, with the measures already in place, Community garlic producers seem to be sufficiently protected. However, given the potential high losses to the Community Budget, the Commission will study whether further measures are necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 18 October 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This Directive confirms the date of 2009 for the full accomplishment of the postal internal market and maintains the framework for ensuring a high quality and affordable universal service.</p>
<p>The preparatory work was based on numerous sector studies including two instigated by the Commission in 2005/2006. Furthermore, appropriate information about developments in the sector, particularly concerning economic, social, employment and technological aspects, as well as about quality of service is to be found in the third Report to the Council and the Parliament on the application of the Postal Directive<a href="#defann_31_4" name="refann_31_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This document contains a detailed Annex containing specific information on the issues raised by the Honourable Member. With regard to the effects of full market opening on the universal service, a Report to the Council and the Parliament ('Commission's prospective study on the impact on universal service of the full accomplishment of the postal internal market in 2009') was produced<a href="#defann_31_5" name="refann_31_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. In addition, an Impact Assessment that accompanies the proposal for an amending Directive has been provided along with a more detailed Annex.</p>
<p>All these documents confirm that postal reform is well under way and assess that full market opening is feasible in all Member States in 2009. The available information and analysis suggests that in order to sustain the progress and results achieved to date, and to secure further improvements together with sustainable employment, the final step in the gradual process of market opening started a decade ago by Directive 97/67/EC should be taken. Employment aspects have been thoroughly examined and are set out in detail in the documents mentioned above. It should be noted that employment prospects are being influenced by a series of factors: these factors include, in particular, demand and changing customer needs, electronic substitution, new technologies and automation as well as organisational change. Positive effects of market opening on employment such as the creation of employment opportunities by new entrants and in adjacent sectors should also be borne in mind.</p>
<p>As far as financing instruments for possible net costs of the universal service are concerned, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the relevant provisions of the above proposed Directive and to its Article 7 in particular. The financing instruments – which include for example state aids, public procurement, compensation funds and cost sharing - have all been carefully considered.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the fact that the British Nuclear Group, which operates the Sellafield nuclear plant, was fined half a million pounds on 16 October 2006 for safety breaches.</p>
<p>As far as EU's competence is concerned, a distinction should be drawn between nuclear safety, which concerns measures taken to limit the risk of accidents in the operation of nuclear installations, and Euratom safeguards - a system designed to ensure that civil nuclear materials are not diverted from the civil uses for which they are intended.</p>
<p>1. Nuclear safety</p>
<p>Despite the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 10 December 2002 in the C-29/99 case recognizing the competences of the European Atomic Energy Community to legislate in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, the lack of a qualified majority in the Council made it impossible to proceed with the so called "nuclear package"<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which defined Community basic obligations and general principles in the field of the safety of the nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>2. Euratom safeguards</p>
<p>The Commission has investigated the implications of the incident at Thorp for the control of nuclear safeguards, according to its competence under the Euratom Treaty. After the investigation, the Commission has addressed a Decision based upon the provisions of Article 83 of the Euratom Treaty to the operator of the Sellafield site, British Nuclear Group, in February 2006. The Decision provides a formal warning to the operator and asks for the implementation of a set of measures aiming to improve safeguards control at the site. A summary of the Decision was published in the Official Journal L 255 of 19 September 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Taking into account the methodological uncertainties, involved in verifying independent ownership and the consolidated turnover of some of the companies covered by the survey, the study report leads to the conclusion that around two-thirds of the biggest contracts (i.e. above the procurement directive thresholds) in the EC were awarded to SMEs (defined in accordance with the EU definition) during that year<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>(EN) In 2003, before the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the average annual farm gate milk price for Irish farmers was 28.7 cent/litre. This price remained stable in 2004 and 2005. The first nine months of 2006 show a price which is only 1.5 cent/litre below the 2003 level. In 2006, Irish farmers will receive a compensation of 3.5 cent/litre of milk. This means a net gain of 2 cents/litre or an increase of 7%.</p>
<p>The current internal market situation is very favourable. Prices of skimmed milk powder are higher than before the reform. Prices of cheese are stable since the start of the reform. Currently, prices for whole milk powder, casein and butter are increasing. This should have a positive effect on farm gate prices.</p>

<p>According to the latest report by the UN Secretary-General (issued in April 2006), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have jointly decided to cut the number of individuals receiving humanitarian aid in the Tindouf camps from 158 000 to 90 000. The failure since 1982 to carry out a reliable census of the populations of the Tindouf camps along internationally recognised lines, which would give precise demographic data on the number of people in the camps and their origins, is preventing the competent international bodies from quantifying the real humanitarian assistance needs of the people in question. Furthermore, this anachronistic situation invites misappropriation of part of the aid.</p>

<p>(EN) In an increasingly integrated and enlarged European Union, non-resident drivers make up more and more of the traffic flow, and some of them flout traffic laws when travelling abroad, without fear of being prosecuted in their country of residence.</p>
<p>In its Recommendation of 21 October 2003 on enforcement in the field of road safety<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission recommended putting in place a mechanism for cross-border enforcement of infringements of road traffic regulations. Its aim was to ensure that, at least for serious and repeated violations, traffic offences are reported to the competent authority of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered, via enforcement co-ordination points that Member States were asked to set up.</p>
<p>As the enforcement of traffic law is one of the most effective ways to reduce road casualties in Europe, the Commission committed itself to propose measures of a more binding nature to achieve the objective of reducing the annual number of road deaths in the EU by 20.000 fatalities (50%) in the year 2010, if measures taken would prove insufficient to attain that target.</p>
<p>Since it appears now that this objective will indeed not be achieved if the current trend (minus 35%) continues, the Commission has put on its Work Programme for 2007 to come up with legislation to this end. Such legislation should ensure that the enforcement of road traffic laws is applied equally to all citizens irrespective of their nationality or residence in the European Union. It would need to contain rules and electronic mechanisms, for instance to enable access to vehicle registration databases throughout the European Union. In addition, there would need to be cooperation between enforcement authorities from the different Member States on a structural basis.</p>
<p>The Commission launched an impact assessment study on road safety enforcement and cross-border cooperation and will shortly publish the consultation paper in this field.</p>
<p>Finally it should be noted that the 24 February 2005 Council Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> gives Member States the power to enforce financial penalties on drivers who have committed a road traffic offence somewhere in the European Union.

<p>In contravention of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1973) and the Protocol thereto (MARPOL 1977/78), the Greek Government, under Presidential Decree 400/1996 (A'268), introduced a deadline of over five years for the installation of waste collection systems on passenger vessels, extended for a further four years under Presidential Decree 374/2002 (A'321).

As regards Annex IV of the MARPOL Convention 73/78 on the prevention of pollution by sewage from shipping, Directive 2000/59/EC<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states that as of 28 September 2004 Member States must make land installations available to respond to the needs of ships. That being said, there is no provision in Community law stipulating that vessels must be equipped with storage tanks or treatment devices. It is therefore up to the Member States to apply international rules in this matter. It should be noted that MARPOL Annex IV authorises discharge into the sea of sewage which is not comminuted or disinfected at a distance of 12 nautical miles from the nearest land.</p>
<p>On a more general level, the Commission has taken significant measures to ensure the prevention of marine pollution by discharges from shipping, inter alia, monitoring strict implementation of the provisions of Directive 2000/59/EC.</p>

<p>(EN) The development, validation and use of validated alternative methods remain an important priority for the European Commission in the context of the cosmetics legislation and REACH as well as more broadly. The Commission pursues in particular three avenues:</p>
<p>1) partnership,</p>
<p>2) European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM),</p>
<p>3) funding through 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Research Programme (FP7).</p>
<p>Even if the resources for these activities will be kept at relatively a constant level in the FP7, they are expected to lead to better and quicker results.</p>
<p>Support by industry and other stakeholders in the framework of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) should significantly accelerate the rate at which alternatives are agreed, validated and put into practice. This partnership is an unprecedented collaboration between the Commission and major companies from seven industry sectors. The partners have committed to pooling knowledge, research and resources to accelerate the development, validation and acceptance of alternative approaches over an initial five-year period. An action programme to promote change has been agreed and progress against this will be regularly published<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The ECVAM of the Joint Research Centre, Institute for Health and Consumer Protection, will continue to play a crucial role in steering the efforts to make alternative methods available. In FP7, the work of ECVAM will be supported by a similar workforce and expertise as in FP6, complemented by a group of scientists from another JRC-IHCP Unit (European Chemicals Bureau) pursuing developments in validation methods such as those in the category of 'in silico' (QSAR<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>). Laboratory activities are planned to be integrated within ECVAM in order to speed up the validation of alternative testing methods (especially for the 'me-too' tests).</p>
<p>Alternative methods are identified as a specific topic in the Cooperation Specific Programme of FP7. The work programme for the first call contains a series of topics to promote alternative testing. Proposals addressing these topics are evaluated by peer review following published criteria. The total amount of funding for alternative testing projects depends therefore on the quality of the proposals submitted.</p>
<p>All this builds on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, communicated to Council and the Parliament in January 2006. One of the Action Plan's objectives is to "Provide greater coordination of existing resources while identifying future needs; Support future trends in animal welfare research and continue to support the 3Rs principle: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement alternative approaches to animal testing".</p>
<p>The Commission restates its previous commitment that validation must not become the bottle-neck for the availability of alternative methods and will give it the necessary priority.</p>

In 1990, the 1962 Recommendation was replaced by Commission Recommendation 90/326/EEC<a href="#defann_42_4" name="refann_42_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> of 22 May 1990 to the Member States concerning the adoption of a European schedule of occupational diseases.

<p>The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that the memoranda referred to in the question have subsequently taken the form of a document called 'Information notices on diagnosis of occupational diseases' completed in 1994 and published as a separate report by the Commission. This report was published in English and French.

<p>As this report is available from the Office of Publications, no specific action has been taken to send copies to the stakeholders concerned. However, copies are made available on an ad hoc basis, inter alia, on the occasion of relevant meetings organised by the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally, the report 'Information notices on diagnosis of occupational diseases' is currently undergoing revision. A specific experts group has been set up in late 2004 to check, revise and update its content in the light of the latest technical and scientific progress in the field.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Commission has proposed a reform of the wine sector with the aim of contributing towards achieving the Lisbon strategy and ensuring the competitiveness of wine producers in the enlarged EU. With this in mind, production should react to the needs of the European and world markets. While sectoral reform is welcome, why does the Commission propose the grubbing-up of vineyards in return for financial compensation instead of a more effective system of restructuring vineyards and stepping up wine-growing and wine-making marketing and information activities? Furthermore, why does the Commission propose the introduction of a harmful ban on the use of sucrose for enrichment of wine, and why does the reform proposed by the Commission fail to pay greater attention to climatic conditions and traditions in individual EU Member States? Does not the Commission consider that the two measures mentioned above might harm the diversity and unique character of wine-growing and wine-making in the EU, which might ultimately lead to an even greater reduction in competitiveness?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is grateful to the Honourable Member for putting down this question because it gives it an opportunity to update the house.</p>
<p>Grubbing-up: The Commission knows that grubbing-up is a controversial matter but it needs to look at it from a more social angle. The Commission will not be able to maintain status quo in the wine sector. Some wine producers will have to leave the sector because they will not be able to face competition. The question is should the Commission give the wine producer the possibility of an arranged exit from the sector or should the Commission do nothing? The Commission does not believe that the best option is to do nothing. The areas which have been grubbed up will be transferred into the single farm payment scheme which would mean that new requirements will avoid environmental damage after grubbing-up. Grubbing-up should not be seen in isolation but in combination with the abolition of market management measures and the establishment of national envelopes to finance more forward looking measures. This is to enable European producers to gain competitiveness and (re)conquer those market shares currently gained by new world producers.</p>
<p>Promotion: The Commission repeats its commitment to consider new opportunities for the promotion of responsible wine consumption. In addition, simpler and more transparent quality classes, via the more World Trade Organisation compatible geographic indications system and labelling rules can help to promote and market European wines. The Commission hopes to accomplish this with the help from the wine sector. However, the current Commission Regulations on the provision of information and the promotion of wine are not fully used.</p>
<p>Chaptalisation: In the Commission's Communication on a sustainable European wine sector, everything has been put on the table since it is important to have an in-depth discussion of all elements of the current common market organisation in wine. The Commission has indeed taken into account the climatic differences in the Community by encouraging the use of grape sugar rather than beet sugar to enhance the alcohol content of wine in certain cases. This is completely consistent with the Community and international definition of wine: "…a product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes…". The excessive "chaptalisation" to increase the alcohol content of wine using beet sugar is even recognised by the profession.</p>
<p>The Commission will endeavour to ensure that EU vineyards and wines with a unique character, recognised by the market, are maintained. As the Commissioner in charge of Agriculture has said on numerous occasions she is looking, listening and learning in many regions of the Community. All of the issues raised by the Honourable Member are and will continue to be examined by the Commission in the coming months while it awaits the opinion of this institution before completing its legislative proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0927"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken note of the United States (US) National Space Policy document referred to by the Honourable Member which was published in October 2006.

The US being a leading space actor, obviously the National Space Policy will be analysed carefully by the Commission.</p>
<p>It can be expected that space policy will be discussed in the framework of regular dialogue in the future.</p>
<p>The new US space policy is not about developing or deploying weapons in space. Weaponisation is not mentioned in the space policy document and senior officials of the White House stated publicly, that this policy is about defending space infrastructures not about weaponisation.</p>
<p>The Commission does have a dialogue on space issues with the US, the inaugural meeting of which was held in March 2006, after having been agreed in principle at the EU-US Summit of June 2005. The Commission should stress that this dialogue seeks to identify avenues for EU-US co-operation only in the area of civilian space activities.</p>
<p>In the civil domain, the Commission is in the process of elaborating, jointly with the European Space Agency, a European Space Policy, accompanied by a European Space Programme; these will be presented to the Space Council in the course of 2007.</p>

<p>(EN) The emphasis since the 2005 mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs has been on establishing a partnership approach, combining action at national level (National Reform Programmes) with supporting measures at Community level (Community Lisbon programme).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently in the process of analysing the national progress reports submitted by Member States, outlining progress made since last year on their respective National Reform Programmes. This analysis will feed-into the Annual Lisbon Progress report, which the Commission foresees for adoption in December 2006. As it was the case in 2005, the Annual Progress Report will include a global assessment of EU progress towards the Lisbon objectives and targets, as well as individual country chapters analysing the situation in each Member State. This analysis takes account of progress made, inter alia, on a number of indicators relevant to competitiveness such as the share of R&amp;D<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in GDP<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the employment rate (illustrating two key priorities of the Lisbon Strategy).</p>
<p>Concerning the promotion of benchmarking, the emphasis in the Lisbon process has moved from benchmarking in the sense of creating 'league tables' to assessing progress in relation to Member States' own starting points and conditions. Since 2005, the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs has put priority also on the national ownership of the reform process. Besides, the Commission promotes the exchange of best policies between Member States, whereby they can learn from each others' experiences.</p>
<p>The Commission remains much committed to actively lead and support the relaunched Lisbon Strategy by fostering joint ownership with Member States and main stakeholders, both in its analysis (through key underpinning analytical reports such as the EU Economic Review 2006, or the Competitiveness Report 2006) and in its benchmarking exercise and policy recommendations through its Annual Progress Report 2006 (due for adoption on 12 December 2006).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member asked how much does industry gain from EU legislation in the way of income and profits.</p>
<p>The benefits of EU legislation cannot be fully quantified yet the available evidence suggests that they are very significant. For example, the effects of the internal market programme have been estimated to at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Other studies put the effect of economic integration between EU-15 Member States at some 10% of GDP. A recent study on "EU accession and income growth"<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> indicates that the net benefits for the new Member States after EU membership may be as high as a 39% increase in total income and a 56% increase in overall trade. An analysis of previous enlargements produced similar data. Spain increased its production per capita from 74%, of the EU average, in 1986 to 84% in 2001, and Portugal increased it from 62% to 75% in the same period.</p>
<p>Regulation can burden businesses either by imposing heavy compliance costs or by requesting information in relation to the compliance with legislation. The latter are called administrative burdens. This distinction is important because the reduction of administrative burdens does not interfere in any way with the substance underlying the piece of legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes a 25% reduction target in administrative burdens, in the entire European Union covering both European and national legislation. This is essentially a particular form of simplification aimed at information requirements both at Community and Member States levels that does not as such affect the underlying legislation. Recent simulations show that reaching this target would generate economic benefits of the order of 1.1 to 1.5% of GDP or around € 150 billion in the medium term<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the burden associated with administrative reporting requirements has to be put into context. Firstly, these requirements have their origin in regional, national and EU level legislation. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that if no reporting obligations emanated from the EU level, the figure would automatically be considerably lower. According to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU only acts where there is an added value to decisions being taken at the national level. It would be fair to assume that in the absence of regulation at EU level, there would exist, in most instances, a corresponding legislation at national level that would equally result in costs for the European economy. It is very likely that a situation in which 25 countries acted individually would actually lead to higher administrative burdens for businesses operating in the internal market. Finally, some of these legal obligations or reporting requirements are inevitable since they are needed in order to monitor compliance with consumer, health and environmental protection or meant to protect the Community's financial management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not aware of any mutual recognition of disability and consequent mutual recognition of related rights for people with disabilities in the EU. Moreover there is as yet no single definition of disability in the EU. This is a matter for individual Member States themselves to determine and at present the definition of disability varies widely between Member States in line with national traditions and rules. Similarly, the benefits both in cash and in kind, available to people with disabilities are matters within the competence of the Member States and such benefits also vary widely.</p>
<p>EU legislation prohibiting discrimination on grounds of disability currently only applies to employment, occupation and vocational training. The Commission has commissioned a study on the national measures which prohibit discrimination in other areas, which should be available in December 2006.</p>

Thus mutual recognition is facilitated by a standard European model outlined in the annex to this Council recommendation covering the practical dispositions of the card. These parking cards are issued in accordance with the respective national provisions – as the definition of disability and the rules for assigning parking cards to people with disabilities are the responsibility of Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0943"></a>

<p>Nevertheless, the Commission will carefully examine complaints received from companies arguing that the different rules on Sunday opening create internal market problems, notably in border regions. For example, the Commission has recently received questions concerning the conditions applicable for the opening of shops on Sundays in tourist areas.

<p>(EN) According to the Treaty of Accession, Member States have the right to apply certain restrictions regarding access to the labour market for workers from all of the 10 Member States that joined on 1 May 2004, except for workers from Cyprus and Malta. The transitional arrangements are divided into three distinct phases, according to the "2-plus-3-plus-2" formula for the period of seven years, different conditions apply during each of these phases.</p>
<p>In a report to the Council on the first phase of the transitional arrangements (1 May 2004 – 30 April 2006), the Commission concluded that there was no threat of negative impact of free movement of workers and that those Member States that had opened their labour markets were able to harness the positive effects of that decision. It urged Member States, when preparing the notification of their intentions for the second phase (1 May 2006 – 30 April 2009), to take due account of the statistical evidence and the conclusions contained in the Commission report.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the decision of a significant number of Member States that have lifted restrictions in the second phase: in addition to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden which had already fully opened their markets during the first phase also Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland decided to open their labour markets from 1 May 2004, and Italy from 21 July 2006. Together with the decisions of other Member States (Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands) to allow easier access to certain sectors/professions through simplified procedures, it shows that most EU-15 Member States agree that the 2004 enlargement has had largely beneficial effects for the EU as a whole.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement within the Schengen area is concerned, it should be noted that the internal border control on persons between the Member States applying the Schengen acquis in full and the Member States which joined the EU in May 2004 are still in place, therefore persons crossing these borders are still submitted to border checks. However, it should be underlined that all EU-citizens have the right to cross these borders on the simple presentation of a valid passport or identity card.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0951"></a>

<p>(FR) The Complaints Board<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a jurisdictional body that is independent of the European Schools’ Board of Governors. Its members are chosen from a list drawn up for the purpose by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and candidates are completely independent and noted for their legal expertise.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot concur with the honourable Member’s assertion that all decisions handed down to date by the Complaints Board are inadmissible on the grounds of the Board’s lack of jurisdiction. It has dealt with 35 complaints in 2005 and 2006, of which only nine have been rejected due to lack of jurisdiction. In 11 of the cases, the Board took a substantive decision. The other cases are either inadmissible on procedural grounds or pending. It therefore appears from these figures that the Board gives a substantive ruling wherever possible.</p>
<p>It is inaccurate to say that Complaints Board adjudicators have never met and that the decisions taken to date have been adopted on the basis of informal procedures. The Complaints Board operates in accordance with the rules laid down by Chapter IV of its Statute and regularly meets in public hearings, announced on the European Schools website<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, at its Brussels headquarters. Furthermore, it is the prerogative of the Chairman of the Board to use the resources he sees fit to communicate with the other Members outside the sessions held in Brussels.</p>
<p>In the Board of Governors, the Commission stated its opposition to extending the Complaints Board’s jurisdiction to all cases that may arise in the European Schools system. The Commission in fact notes that the signatories to the Convention defining the statute of the European schools did not want to grant the European Schools complete immunity from legal process. An extension of immunity from legal process to issues other than those currently covered can only come from a change to the Convention itself or from an additional agreement between the signatories. It cannot come from a unilateral act agreed upon by the Board of Governors. Furthermore, the Board of Governors and the administration and financial committee have indicated that granting general powers to the Complaints Board would have far-reaching consequences in terms of its structure and its modus operandi, leading to costs on which it is hard to put a figure, but probably comparable with those of the Court of First instance.</p>
<p>To answer the honourable Member’s last question, the Commission would note that the European Schools system is under no circumstances exempt from upholding the principle of legality, given that all cases not falling under the Complaints Board’s competence fall under national jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It should be specified that issues relating to discipline are subject to a procedure that is clearly set out in Article 44 of the general rules of the European Schools, which places great emphasis on the right to defence and any exclusion from the school of more than two weeks can be referred administratively to the Secretary-General of the European Schools and, where applicable, to the Complaints Board. On the other hand, any cases concerning the enrolment of pupils, which is currently the sole responsibility of each adjudicator<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, under Article 46 of the General Rules of the European Schools do not fall under the competence of the Complaints Board but should be brought before the national courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission gives a prominent role to the agri-environmental measures which support the sustainable development of rural areas and respond to society's increasing demand for environmental services. Council Regulation (EC) n° 1257/1999<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides for the means to encourage european farmers to serve society as a whole by continuing the use of environmental friendly practices in order to protect and improve the environment, natural resources, soil and genetic diversity and to maintain the landscape and countryside. Under Council Regulation (EC) n° 1698/2005<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, measures aiming at improving the environment and the countryside, among which are agri-environmental measures, will continue to play a prominent role in the programming period 2007-2013, with at least 25% of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) total contribution. Also the fact that the agri-environmental measures are, and will continue to be, the sole compulsory measures for the Member States within this policy show the highest priority the Commission attribute to them.</p>
<p>The rural development programmes approved by the Commission create the legal framework and provide for the necessary EU budgetary resources for concrete measures in order to achieve the overall EU environment and rural development objectives. Annually, the Commission decides the EU overall allocation for each Member State. The Member States are responsible for assigning this annual amount to each measure of their programmes taking into account their specific needs. As far as the agri-environmental measures are concerned, for example, the Member States have the possibility to amend the measures' allocation and/or content throughout the implementation period of the programmes in order to achieve a better uptake. Any discrepancy between the estimates done by the Member States and the actual implementation is the sole responsibility of the Member States and the Commission has no means to prevent their non-payment. Obviously, we are all eager to see that the results of these programmes are the best possible and it is always regrettable when some measures can not be financed in a Member State, hindering the full performance of the specific programmes.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is not possible to indicate the EU average for non-implementation of the agri-environment measures in 2004 and 2005. However, the Commission can inform you that in the EU15 a total of €3.937,257 million of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee section, were spent during those two years. Of this amount, €161,451 million were spent by Portugal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
