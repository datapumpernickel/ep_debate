<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members – and Yevgenia, it is very nice to see you out there – the European Union has expressed its indignation at the use of selective justice in Ukraine on a number of occasions over the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements from Brussels and from Member States, and the messages passed directly to the authorities in Kiev, refer not only to the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, but also to cases against members of the former government such as Mr Lutsenko and others. Politically motivated justice is a systemic problem in Ukraine, and it needs a systemic solution in the shape of comprehensive judicial reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indicated to the Ukrainian authorities that a first step towards regaining confidence would be to ensure an environment conducive to Ms Tymoshenko’s recovery, whether inside or outside Ukraine, and I am glad that President Schulz and Prime Minister Azarov agreed last week that the European Parliament would play an important role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to independent visitors is especially important if we are to build a clear picture of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko’s situation and, in this respect, I welcome recent visits, including by Members of the European Parliament. Most important, in terms of Ms Tymoshenko’s legal rights, is that Ukraine’s Court of Cassation should announce its decision on her case at the end of June, and that the European Court of Human Rights can announce its own decision shortly afterwards. This also applies in the case of Mr Lutsenko, whose sentence was recently upheld on appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Any future trials should strictly respect the provisions of the new Ukrainian Code of Criminal Procedure, thus providing for equality between defence and prosecution, and should operate without pre-trial detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern about selective justice remains strong. Last Tuesday, at the Cooperation Council with Ukraine, we clearly set out to Prime Minister Azarov how we believe Ukraine can get back on the road to political association. The political relationship between the European Union and Ukraine will not improve without firm commitments and an effective demonstration that the rule of law and respect for fundamental values are applied systematically in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We have repeatedly stressed to our Ukrainian partners that we will not be able to move towards signing our association agreement if they cannot show that they live in the spirit of political association. To this end, we expect Ukraine to make visible progress. The recent adoption of the new Code of Criminal Procedure in Ukraine was certainly a step forward, and it should improve the quality of future prosecutions and trials. However, Ms Tymoshenko and other victims of politically motivated justice have already been sentenced. Action to reform the Criminal Code, defining what is to be considered a criminal offence, is needed to get to the heart of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiative taken by President Schulz in asking Prime Minister Azarov to accept that a person of high international repute be sent on behalf of the European Parliament to observe the second trial, with full access to judges, lawyers and documents. The parliamentary elections in October will also be an important test. We will observe very closely the conditions in which the electoral campaign and the voting process proceed. It is important, if Ukraine wants to fulfil its European aspirations, that the elections should be free and fair beyond doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to mention the European Parliament resolutions calling on the Commission to support judicial reform in Ukraine. In December last year, the Commission signed a financing agreement of EUR 10 million with Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice. It aims to accelerate sustainable reforms in the justice sector in Ukraine, with a particular focus on criminal justice reforms. We have also recently agreed to engage with Ukraine in an informal dialogue on judiciary reform, drawing on the expertise of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, what we expect from Ukraine before we can once again move forward is: firstly, a concrete strategy to redress the effect of selective justice and prevent any recurrence of it; secondly, free and fair elections; and thirdly, the resumption of delayed reforms already agreed in the joint EU-Ukraine ‘Association Agenda’ which has now been in force for two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. I look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that Ukraine has been moving in the opposite direction over the last two years. Counterfeit goods have been produced, the judicial system has been politicised and there have been political trials. The leaders of the opposition are in prison as a result of politically motivated judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, I agree with you that this is a systemic issue. The problem is rooted in the system and it cannot be eliminated simply by introducing formal reforms. There must also be the determination and the readiness to apply them, to put the rule of law and democracy into practice and to take the consequences. This could be done now. We have been discussing the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuri Lutsenko and many others for almost a year. New promises are constantly made and new procedures are initiated, but the promises are not kept and none of the measures are properly implemented. Instead, one gets the impression that the government is playing for time. Postponing the session of the court of appeal also seems to me to be a case of gaining time which will ultimately make it possible to prevent opposition politicians from taking part in the next elections.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the crucial point. There can only be free and fair elections if the leaders of the opposition can participate in them on equal terms. The judicial system must not be used to stop this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">When matters are resolved in the court of appeal and then new cases are brought, which are actually old cases that the supreme court has ruled on several times in order to settle issues which have to do with the statute of limitations, that also represents an abuse of the rule of law. For this reason, Mr Füle, I believe that you are right.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the importance of Ukraine being a part of Europe, we are in favour of the association agreement. The European Parliament would be prepared to ratify the agreement very quickly and to support it being signed, if Ukraine fulfilled certain requirements. By initialling the agreement, we have shown that we are willing to do this. Now the ball is in the Ukrainian Government’s court. I hope that the government does not believe that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will get tired if it waits long enough and that, as a result, it will get something which it would not have achieved if it did not meet the requirement of introducing the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we would like to see those who signed this agreement implement this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a problem. It is not only Yulia Tymoshenko and Mr Lutsenko but, as has already been mentioned, we have to deal with serious deficiencies in Ukraine’s legal system. Partnership between the EU and Ukraine should be based on the observation of human rights, the rule of law and, of course, the functioning of the entire legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Ukrainian partners attempted to make certain reforms. Here, I would like to mention the Criminal Procedure Code which has been adopted. Moreover, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe participated in the preparation of this Criminal Procedure Code – but we have to go further. The entire legal system of Ukraine has to be reformed. Again, I would like to welcome the decision to establish a constitutional assembly which, again, will carry out its work with the experts from the Venice Commission and, I hope, also with the opposition in Ukraine and with civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">How to deal with Yulia Tymoshenko’s case? Now the case will go before Ukraine’s High Specialised Court. Last week, we heard a statement by President Azarov, who invited us to send international legal experts. I think that is a first step towards dealing with this issue in such a way that the release of Yulia Tymoshenko is in accordance with both international law and Ukrainian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The case, of course, will perhaps go to this city, to Strasbourg, to the European Court of Human Rights. The Ukrainian side promised – and I think we should insist on that – that the verdict and, of course, the implementation of the Court’s judgment will be fully respected.</p>

We therefore urge our colleagues in the Party of Regions to implement what they agreed to. This year will be decisive, both in the case of Yulia Tymoshenko and, of course, later on in October with the elections, in terms of whether they will be able to implement what they agreed to.</p>

The country could either go the same way as Belarus, which would mean that there is no longer only one ‘last dictatorship’ in Europe but two (and there may be other contenders for that, Mr Landsbergis), or Ukraine could develop into a modern democracy. This is also possible, because today, Ukraine is not Belarus and should not develop that way. With regard to the rule of law, I must say that indeed there is probably some progress, but it must materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the Tymoshenko case is a test case. There are other cases, but we should use this case to see whether progress is being made or not. It is true that Ms Tymoshenko is being treated better than before, but this should not be the end of the case. The Court of Cassation should be free, fair, open and transparent in the revision of court cases. If you look further, the way homosexuals were treated in a demonstration – which had to be cancelled – is a bad thing. Ukraine should accept that everybody is equal. The fact that there is a law before the Rada saying that homosexuality should not be propagated is a bad thing because education on this issue should be transparent, free and fair. Again, Ukraine should change in this respect. As the Commissioner said, the coming elections – whether they are free or fair – are also a benchmark.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in favour of a boycott of the European football championship. Why not? We are having these discussions because of the championship in the same way that we talked about human rights in China because of the Olympic Games. We should use the opportunity; those who represent their countries in Ukraine should use the opportunity to draw the attention to the human rights situation. Ukraine need not become like Belarus.

I am also pleased that the cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and of the former ministers, Yuri Lutsenko and Heorhiy Filipchuk, are receiving the appropriate level of attention. When we show our solidarity with Ms Tymoshenko, I strongly believe that we should always refer to the full list of politicians and former high-ranking officials who are now in prison for political reasons as a result of a retaliation campaign organised by the regime of President Yanukovych. This is not only about Yulia Tymoshenko. It is about the systematic persecution of the relevant leaders of the opposition parties in Ukraine. I think that we have made progress in raising public awareness of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having reached this point, we must not stop. Therefore, I would like to urge the EU once again not to choose the simple solution, which would be to say that we will boycott the European Championships in Ukraine. I am of the opinion that we should boycott the Ukrainian Government together with those, including the President, who support this unjust judicial system. However, we should not boycott the citizens of Ukraine. The original idea of holding the European Championships within the EU and in one the EU’s neighbouring countries is exactly the right one and it should continue to apply. The European Championships must lead to an increase in discussions and debates about democracy. All of those who are officially taking part should make very clear their criticism of the legal proceedings against Ms Tymoshenko and other politicians who are currently in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The best outcome would be if this unjust legal case were to be dropped before the football starts. I do not know if the Ukrainian Government has the insight to do this. At this stage, it is important for us to continue our criticism. In my opinion, the association agreement, which has not been paid as much attention during the course of the debate as the football has, should not be signed while the judicial system in the Ukraine remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">The next elections must genuinely show that Ukraine is moving towards democracy and the rule of law. We must focus on calling for the former leading opposition politicians to take part in the elections as opposition candidates. It is not enough just to release them. They must be rehabilitated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the real aspiration of the people of Ukraine. I would like to ask if it is true that all of us in the Chamber today are able to say that if Ukraine changes, we will support its journey into Europe? Did we all support Ms Tymoshenko’s government on this? Each of us ought to think about how we voted three years ago. Are we really being sincere about this?</p>
<p class="contents">Two questions are important at the moment. Firstly, we need to show this prospect to Ukraine, not to this or that government, but to the citizens of Ukraine, as Ms Harms has said. We need to show them this possibility, and then demand change. This change must be very specific, it must concern those who today have been unjustly sentenced, and it must concern reforms to the judicial system and of local government. This is a very important matter, something to which Prime Minister Azarov has also committed himself. It will place authority and decisions back in the hands of all Ukrainians – people who are watching us today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this is very important: I would like to express heartfelt thanks to Mr Schulz for this initiative, and to Commissioner Füle for his real efforts to resolve the situation in Ukraine. Help is still needed from you both in another matter. Mr Schulz, I would like to ask you to ensure that the delegation of observers is a big one. Commissioner Füle, perhaps it will be possible to find additional funds so that some of the citizens of the European Union can go and support the elections – they can be given training and go as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us have a repeat of what happened in 2004. This is the real expectation of all parties and political groups in Ukraine. Let us all go there as neighbours and with the proper preparation – and not just politicians, but also non-governmental organisations. This will be a real expression of neighbourly goodwill. Let us say clearly today that if Ukraine changes, we will have the courage to say: yes, you do have the prospect of European Union membership. Let us say boldly at this point that as neighbours, we can do something specific today – we can go and observe the elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is natural that the European Union should call upon Ukraine, too, to maintain human rights, democratic standards and the proper operation of its justice system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is legitimate to talk about the dubious situation in relation to Ms Tymoshenko, as well as about other examples which have given rise to doubt over respect for standards in Ukraine. However, a completely separate matter which should nevertheless be mentioned at this point is the question of boycotting Euro 2012 and the decision to do so which has, after all, been announced publicly by the European Commission. The question arises as to whether such a decision is, in fact, helpful in this matter, a matter about which we are all concerned – raising democratic standards. Are we sure that such a decision will also help resolve the dramatic situation of the former Premier of Ukraine?</p>
<p class="contents">We know today that the Ukrainian opposition has not joined this kind of demand for a boycott or for the outright removal of this great sporting event from Ukraine. We know the majority of the Ukrainian people have been waiting five years for the chance to enjoy the experience associated with this celebration of European football. We also saw in this the chance for greater integration and a way to bring the Ukrainian people closer to the European Union and to Europe. We know, too, that a decision to impose a boycott of any kind can only push Ukraine into the hands of Putin’s Russia, who today is already posing as a defender of Ukraine and criticising the European Commission, something which is certain to gain him points with a fairly sizeable section of the Ukrainian nation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something which requires both tact and wisdom. The question also arises about our standards here in the European Union. Are we going to be equally principled in the case of the Sochi Winter Olympics, which are being organised by Russia – a country which also occupies one third of the territory of the independent country of Georgia? Are we going to be equally principled in the case of Belarus, which is hosting the World Ice Hockey Championship – are we going to demand a boycott there too? Finally, on what grounds is the European Commission making statements about a boycott, since, in fact, it is not authorised to speak on the subject? Ms Ashton has not said anything here, and she of course is authorised to take a position and to coordinate that position with individual Member States. This, too, is missing, because there has been no consultation of the position on this with Poland, which is, after all, co-hosting the European Championship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various corruption scandals in EU countries do not bother us in the slightest. It is only exceptionally that a former statesman is convicted, as was recently the case with French President Chirac. Some EU states offer political asylum to fraudsters and, at the same time, try to put pressure on neighbouring countries to provide special privileges to former top politicians, contrary to the principles of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not a big football fan, but the tendency to link the European football tournament in Ukraine with the sentencing of former premier, Yulia Tymoshenko, has come as an unpleasant surprise. It is a fact that I have been trying for years to get more young women into top-level politics. It does not follow from this in any way, of course, that I would approve special conditions for privileged prisoners to serve out their punishments and special forms of treatment, in a country with several million people unemployed and homeless. Such an approach from politicians on the right does not surprise me. They have long been pushing for debts caused by the banks to be paid off by reducing the social standards of the poorest, even at the cost of high unemployment and dismantling the social state.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make noisy protest against the European Parliament exporting such behaviour – including impunity for large-scale fraudsters – to countries outside the EU. In the case of Yulia Tymoshenko and people connected with her, some of the proposals violate the principle of equal treatment for citizens. It is not possible to grant political asylum to the fraudsters we call oligarchs in Eastern Europe, and then to hold a noisy debate about economic sanctions against those who are trying to rid themselves of the worst forms of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose, ladies and gentlemen, that we put our own house in order first. I would like to recommend in particular that MEPs from the so-called new EU states acquaint us with the anti-corruption measures recently adopted in their own countries. Only then would I like to hear their views on the situation in Ukraine. It is not only football, but also politics that must finally start to acknowledge the rules of fair play.</p>

Even if the politicians in Kiev meet the demands from Brussels, we run the risk that the people of the country will not forget the interference from outside, from Brussels, which they regard as a humiliation. The fact that the EU can send officials to monitor court proceedings and doctors to ensure that Ms Tymoshenko receives medical treatment represents a clear concession which calls into question a boycott of the European Football Championships.</p>
<p class="contents">The criminal proceedings against Ms Tymoshenko were, of course, highly arbitrary. However, we must ask ourselves whether it makes sense to put at risk the current relatively workable relationship with Kiev. In the light of the EU’s short-sighted policy with regard to Ukraine, we should not be surprised if the Ukrainians move further away from Europe and towards the Russian alternative in the elections which are planned for October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it.</p>

I have a question, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe you indicated, Commissioner, that the entry into force of the association agreement will be linked not only to the case of Tymoshenko, but to the free and fair elections to be organised this autumn. Of course that is important, but my question is: does it mean that you do not envisage making any move before the elections in Ukraine this year?</p>
<p class="contents">Building a democracy is a long-term process – as we have seen within the European Union, where some of the Central and Eastern European countries still have ups and downs in terms of democratic development. What is important, however, is that the authorities understand the problems and work on them. Unfortunately, we have seen our eastern neighbourhood somehow getting less democratic in recent years, in contrast to the southern neighbourhood. There is a subject for further study there. I am not going to enter into details now, but, while it is too much to compare Ukraine to Belarus, it is true that, not only in Ukraine but also in some other countries, we see these backward steps, and we have to take account of them. We have to show consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that two Member States of the European Union – Bulgaria and Romania – are subject to special mechanisms in the field of the judiciary, simply because high-level corruption and abuses of power were not tackled. Currently, two prime ministers are in the spotlight: one of them, in Romania, has been sentenced and the other one is under investigation and may be fined on certain charges. So we should not, in principle, deny that former prime ministers, ministers and other high-level politicians have to face justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, also seek to prevent countries from slipping back into a situation of impunity, and that goes for the current government and current ministers too. Ukraine belongs to Europe, and we should do our best to avoid it rushing into any kind of Asia-related project. The S&amp;D Group will continue to use its relations with the parties of the region to mediate in this delicate situation. Once again, we emphasise that we share the evaluation of the situation, and especially that selective justice is not acceptable.</p>

<p class="contents">What, then, are the problems? Last week’s report from the Commission highlighted the following: an increasing centralisation of power, rising corruption and the very selective way in which it is tackled, the ever-deteriorating treatment of prisoners and a growing anti-homosexual climate that is now even threatening to be enshrined in law.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Ukrainian parliament to reject this law. Ukraine needs to get away from the culture of political pay-offs, as those benefiting today are the victims of tomorrow, and vice versa. This culture is all about holding on to power, rather than using that power to help the country progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, next month, the eyes of the world will turn to Ukraine when football’s European Championships take place. Unfortunately, the cameras will not be solely focused on the pitch, but also on the political institutions in Kiev, the prisons right across the country and on the Tymoshenko case in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that, next month, the world will be talking about players like Shevchenko and Tymoshchuk, rather than about Tymoshenko and Lutsenko. Only the Yanukovych regime can ensure that, however. Necessary political changes would not only lead to a successful football championships, but also, I believe, to a successful association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be an example to others, but unfortunately, it is not. It is failing to meet the political criteria. The entire democratic world is concerned about selective application of the law to political opponents. The prosecutor works to political orders, and the prison administration grossly violates prisoners’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted under laws that are contrary to EU and UN standards. Even if it has been possible, under enormous pressure, to stop her being tortured and to begin treatment, her rights are still being grossly violated. It is only the tip of the iceberg, beneath which lies political interference in the judiciary. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated last year against 400 disloyal judges. The aim is to frighten citizens, silence the opposition and re-establish one-party government, with some sections of the European left standing by and possibly even helping out.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know what is worse – the legal misuse of prisoners’ medical information or the deliberate, massive disinformation campaign of the prosecutor, the Health Ministry and the President. It amounts to an enormous abuse of public power for political gain, reinforcement of the power of pro-government oligarchs and increasing corruption. Ladies and gentlemen, the independence of the forthcoming autumn elections is now in doubt, and this greatly saddens me. It will lead the beautiful country of Ukraine and its citizens further away from the EU.</p>

Shameful things are going on there, because it is shameful to put a former prime minister and several ministers in prison. However, very good things are also happening – reforms are being introduced which make all the legislation associated with the fiscal treaty look simple. Reforms of tax law have been brought in, along with reforms of penal law. At the same time, things have never been so bad in Ukraine in terms of the economic climate. Never before have foreign investors been making such complaints about the legal system in Ukraine. However, in the very same country, new electoral legislation has been adopted in good time and with the agreement of the opposition. In the very same country, the opposition has united, in order to work together against the Party of the Regions. So I would like us to know all this before we say unthinkingly that a new Belarus is emerging or that the situation is just a complete disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, elections are to be held in which the citizens of Ukraine must have the right – we can help them in this – to say in a national poll if they support the policy of the Party of the Regions or not. This is a fundamental matter for this year. In relation to this, we should ensure that the elections are free and fair, because we do have the appropriate tools for this – we have already done this once before, when, a few years ago, we were able to secure free and fair elections in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in Ukraine are not helping us. Talking about standards in the field of human rights is a waste of breath and does not achieve anything. However, what also horrifies me is the chorus of wise guys in the European Union who want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, who think that Ukraine is a lost cause and that we should break off talks with Ukraine and so in fact push it into the arms of Moscow. Moscow is sitting quietly with its ‘hands off’, but all these zealots are, in fact, implementing Moscow’s policy for it, and I want to protest against this. We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Finally, I would like to welcome Yevgenia Tymoshenko and say we are keeping our fingers crossed for her struggle to secure her mother’s release. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when the Orange group was in power in Ukraine, the situation was similar, except that at that time, the association agreement did not exist, because in fact, no matter how much some of us may not like this, the association agreement was negotiated by representatives of the Party of the Regions and it is they who have put this document on the table today.

Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the discrepancy between what are said to be our shared values and the reality in the country is growing ever greater. The regime believes that only by keeping the opposition leader, Ms Tymoshenko, and other members of her government in prison can it be sure of winning the parliamentary elections in October.</p>
<p class="contents">Power is becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of the Yanukovych family and its close associates who are seeking to increase their own wealth. Key positions in the ministry of the interior, the tax authorities and the central bank, among other organisations, are now held by these people. Then the prime minister’s son, Alexander, goes on a shopping trip and buys up small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country, with the support of the tax authorities. He suddenly appears on the list of the richest people in Ukraine and his wealth has obviously grown significantly within the space of a year. The population responds with resignation and apathy to shameless acts of this kind, which simply serve to increase the family’s personal fortune, and to the imprisonment of the opposition. However, the people also remember that the Orange camp during its period in government also spent more time fighting than implementing the necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do now? I am calling on the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to terminate this agreement of 14 October 2010 earlier than planned and not to leave it in place until the parliamentary elections. Of course dialogue remains important, but we should not artificially enhance the status of these people by means of an agreement of this kind. The EU should initiate a comprehensive communication strategy aimed directly at the population and at civil society in order to make it clear what our concerns are. At the same time, we should tell Mr Yanukovych what we expect of him and by when. We need to set clear limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, you should not be under the illusion that the good intentions that we have towards the country and its people in our agreement have been the driving force behind the actions of the ruling family. The reality is that the son of Mr Yanukovych, the rest of the family and its friends want to increase their personal wealth. The only question is whether the other oligarchs see this as a threat to their own interests. We should combine the carrot for the country with a stick for the family and the oligarchs for their dishonestly acquired wealth in the EU. We need to locate their assets and freeze them. I have read that Cyprus would be a good place to start looking for the accounts. I hope that we have the political will to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I think we do need to realise that the people of Ukraine feel they are a truly European society. Current public opinion polls show that over 70% of the people who live in Ukraine support Ukraine’s integration with the European Union. I think that in many of the European Union’s Member States, we can only dream of such a result. So of course, on the one hand, we must condemn the selective application of the law, the violations of human rights, the inhumane treatment of prisoners, the violations of and restrictions on freedom of speech and the persecution of business people just because they support opposition parties; and we must, of course, demand democratic, free and fair elections, in which we should, by the way, help by sending as many EU observers as possible. However, on the other hand, we must not shut the European door on Ukraine. We have to show them that the European Union is open to extensive cooperation with Ukraine – obviously, we must not punish Ukrainian society for the Soviet mentality of its authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to appeal to President Yanukovych. Mr Yanukovych, there are certain moments in history which are decisive in terms of how you will be remembered.

The only alternative to this situation is for Yulia Tymoshenko to be freed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that anything more needs to be said, given that any other sensible comments – of which I have heard several – risk casting a smokescreen over what is actually happening in that country. I believe the time has come for all of us to cooperate together, including the sporting authorities, for even if it is true that a boycott would not work, it is equally true that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the event organiser, in particular, must add its voice to the calls on the government in Kiev to release Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p class="contents">For some years, UEFA has promoted its own campaign, called ‘Respect’, to combat discrimination in all its forms.

It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month.</p>
<p class="contents">And, lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I was somewhat surprised to read that the President of this House entertained the Prime Minister of Ukraine last week. Given that neither the Council nor the Commission went to such lengths, I wonder whether our coordination within the institutions of the Union is appropriate, and I would like Mr Füle, the Commissioner, to tell me if this coordination exists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not think that we should underestimate the significance of the fact that there are now just six weeks to go before these football championships. Now is the time that Ukraine could meet us halfway on matters of human rights. In the European Union, Mr Barroso, among others, has said that he may stay away from the games. Is Mr Mauro of the view that it is right to use these six weeks to put pressure on Ukraine to take a step forward in human rights matters? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, such as the association agreement, for example, is also important to Ukraine and its European ambitions. In order to move closer to the EU and even one day to become part of it, other countries must have the same values as the EU. This applies to all countries which want a closer relationship with EU, including Ukraine, regardless of who is currently in power there.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the first things that becomes noticeable when a country’s values differ from those of the EU is that human rights and the rule of law do not function properly. In the case of Ukraine, we in the European Parliament have been concerned for some time about both of these issues. Most importantly, we believe that Ukraine does not make a distinction between political trials and judicial trials. Criminal acts should be punished because they are against the law, but there must be no more political trials.</p>
<p class="contents">If Ukraine is serious about moving closer to the EU, judicial trials must be transparent and comply with EU standards. Human rights must be respected and the media must be independent. Without these three things, there will be a more closed society in Ukraine and that is not the route which we want the country to take.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the European Parliament have always been clear about what we expect from our partners. It is now up to the people of Ukraine to call for the necessary changes. We cannot deviate from our values, but we can help Ukraine to transform into a modern democracy and we are prepared to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have stated on numerous occasions our desire for Ukraine and the 45 million plus Ukrainians to have a European perspective. The obstacle preventing this is not Yulia Tymoshenko, but the family-type, oligarchic structure created in Ukraine in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. Unfortunately, this family oligarchy clearly has no desire to reform the country based on a European model. What is paramount for them is to preserve the financial channels for getting rich.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine is not the only example of this. The further east we go from Berlin, the more difficult the democratic transition is.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard verbal assurances many times from those in power that they will find a solution to the Tymoshenko case and those involving the other opposition leaders. I was at the conference in Yalta last September where President Yanukovych declared in front of Carl Bildt and other colleagues of mine that there would be a positive development in Ms Tymoshenko’s situation by the end of 2011. Not only has this not happened, but we are seeing the situation evolve precisely in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not called for a boycott of the European Football Championships as a sporting event. On the contrary, I am calling for this opportunity to be used to encourage the reforms in the country and confirm the European perspective ahead of Ukraine. However, this event must not be used in any way by the Ukrainian ruling group for self-promotion, which must be guaranteed by those European politicians who are considering going to Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the Ukrainian authorities for agreeing to this meeting and for making the appropriate preparations for us to have over an hour and a half of in-depth conversation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with information about her health. It was indeed sad to see such an active, hard-working and dynamic person confined to her bed, unable to move and visibly suffering. Nonetheless, we had a very interesting conversation about many things, including, Commissioner Füle, Mr Schulz’s initiative to send a last-chance mission – to find a respected politician in Europe who will go and look once again at the matter of the charging and conviction of Ms Tymoshenko and who will attend the final phase of her trial, the cassation appeal. Following this conversation, I have the impression that there is initial consent from Ms Tymoshenko about this on one condition: that it is someone who is impartial, not involved in the matter in any way and independent in their opinions, and that the choice should also be consulted with the opposition in Ukraine, not just with the authorities, and I would like to appeal for this to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, some form of dialogue must be maintained. It is obvious that the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko is a politically motivated show trial, which is unacceptable. Ms Tymoshenko must be released as soon as possible, although I must add that she is not a Joan of Arc and neither is she innocent as a lamb; still, this show trial is unacceptable. Every speaker mentioned that the rule of law must be restored in Ukraine. I agree that we do not have much time to put pressure on the Yanukovych Government.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, I would like to bring up another aspect of the lack of the rule of law: it is extremely unsettling that despite requests from the Council of Europe, several MEPs and the leaders of the minorities concerned, the Ukrainian authorities failed to take minorities into consideration when delineating electoral districts for the parliamentary elections. Some years ago, Ukraine still managed to work this out in Subcarpathia, but this time there was a lack of political will on the part of the current Ukrainian leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, she left the balcony shortly after her formal reception and it is clear that she does not seem to show a great deal of interest in our opinions. Let me get to the point. Objectively, it must be recognised that the continued detention of the former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, is exacerbating the political climate in Ukraine. From my position, I would not dare to judge the level of Ms Tymoshenko's responsibility for the economic failure in the administration of the country or the murder of its political opponents. I agree that every citizen, including Yulia Tymoshenko, has the right to a fair trial. Ukraine is one of the European Union’s most important neighbours, and therefore an interest on the part of the EU in the functioning of its political and judicial system is understandable. Our involvement in addressing the political disputes between the democratically-elected government and opposition political forces should not lead to an even greater polarisation of the political scene in Ukraine. On the contrary; a civilised, factual, open and impersonal dialogue between all relevant political forces in Ukraine should be our main objective for Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am disappointed because when we talk about the situation in Ukraine, we should be talking about it in all contexts, not associating it with one person. What is more, until recently, this person was the country’s prime minister and she had the opportunity to take all the measures for which we are now reproaching the current Ukrainian Government. This is not to say that in Ukraine, all is well and that Ukraine cannot cope with the substantive criticism. This criticism should, in any case, be substantive and universal, and should focus on measures that are to the benefit of all citizens and not only in favour of the imprisoned prime minister. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to add one more thing. I very much hope that Ukraine will take steps towards the creation of the best possible relations with the European Union. In fact, though, it would be inappropriate for us to criticise the fact that their prime minister has been indicted and will subsequently be tried for her poor management of state assets, because if similar measures were in place in our Member States, our citizens would welcome it if our politicians were convicted for similar handling of state assets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not indifferent to Ukraine, we want Ukraine to be a fully-fledged partner in Europe, but we want it to be a partner which inspires respect, upholds human rights and is ruled by law. The imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and other opposition figures means the current President and government of Ukraine have not chosen this European route. Changes to the justice system, improvements on human rights, introducing local government, and all of this together with free and fair elections – this is the way for Ukraine to confirm that it is heading for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us give an important signal to the citizens of Ukraine, here, from the European Parliament, that firstly we are not talking about a boycott of Euro 2012, but that in return, we do expect the release of oppositionists being held in prison and we do expect free and fair elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Serbia, elections have been won by parties and groups which are anti-European and opposed to Europe. The regime in Belarus has not relaxed its grip at all, but continues instead to bolster its position, nor are we dealing with a process of democratisation in Putin’s Russia at the moment, but with another case of tightening the reins. It seems to me that we should be very concerned about this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if we look at what is going on in Ukraine, I have the feeling that anti-European forces are getting stronger there too, although society in general is in favour of Europe. The First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Renat Kuzmin, visited us here in Parliament, and we talked about the situation of Yulia Tymoshenko. We said it is imperative she be released immediately on health grounds. All we heard in reply was that there are going to be further trials, this time in connection with suspicions that Members of the Ukrainian Parliament have been murdered.

It is also about the principles upon which institutions and democracy function in Ukraine, and it is also about which principles the EU wishes to apply in order to implement its policy towards neighbouring and partner countries. Yulia Tymoshenko is an example of a political process that would not arise at all under normal circumstances. Political and criminal responsibility should be clearly separated in each country that is committed to democratic values. Government institutions in Ukraine should guarantee the independence and transparency of all judicial processes and should not selectively apply justice against political opponents. In Ukraine the political struggle should take place within a free and fair election campaign, and not by imprisoning political opponents. It is not possible to call a political game in which the opposition is in prison a fair one, just as it is not fair to play a football match against a team that is sitting in the changing room. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That she is now languishing in prison is something which is not acceptable, and while she may have issues to address, they should be done so in accordance with the normal judicial norms and that is what we should work towards. It is not acceptable that she is being treated as she is as of now.</p>

You are all right. The situation that we are facing is very complex.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of the bigger picture. We are talking about the transformation and transition of a country of 50 million people, we are talking about the transformation of eastern Europe and we are talking about a country, a region, where, not a long time ago – and we all here remember this – a totalitarian regime reigned, the Soviet totalitarian regime to be more precise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first region where the European Union has tried to transform and expand the values of democracy and legality. There are others – central Europe, the western Balkans – where, through the policy of enlargement and by using those countries’ vision of sooner or later joining the European Union, this organisation has been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no illusions about Ukraine and that part of Europe. I have a vision that sooner or later, we will be able to be bold with regard to this region and this country and that we will help in the transformation there. Now, in that transformation, there has been a discussion about geopolitics being on one side and values on the other side. I do not see a contradiction. I think we need to be aware of geopolitics, but we should not play geopolitics. I think we should do everything possible to help Ukraine to transform and that this is in line with the legitimate aspirations of the people. We should be flexible, innovative and creative. We should not see the situation as being black and white.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is one thing on which we should never compromise. We should never compromise on our values and our principles because, if we do and if we make these compromises, sooner or later, we will face more than challenges – problems – in our own neighbourhood, if not within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That was my first point. My second point concerns boycotting the football championship. In the Commission and the Council, we have never used the word ‘boycott’. Let me therefore reiterate the position on Euro 2012. As matters now stand, President Barroso has no intention of travelling to the Ukraine or of attending Euro 2012 events in Ukraine. This position is shared by the College, bearing in mind that Commissioners would have been attending in a personal rather than a professional capacity. It is not a boycott and we hope that Euro 2012 will be a great success. This does not affect the matches in Poland, of course. And yes, the Commission is in favour of the fair play which is so closely associated with sport also being associated with politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the important question about the elections – free and fair elections. The Member States are agreed on the importance of sending as many European Union election observers as possible as part of the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission. The European Union delegation in Kiev has already started coordinating actions with the European Union Heads of Missions with a view to supporting training of observers or financing exit polls, which played an essential role in the evaluation of previous elections, particularly those in 2004. A European Union delegation has also observed all the relevant meetings of the Central Election Commission. Also in the pipeline are projects in support of media monitoring, analysis of marketing of parties and so on with the Council of Europe – all the projects to reach out to vulnerable voters. That was my third point.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point – to a more interested group of parliamentarians – is that, for my part, I care about former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko as a person and I care about her as a politician.</p>
<p class="contents">As a person, together with you, I will do my best firstly to ensure that she has access to medical care she feels comfortable with and that treatment begins to address the cause of her illness. Next, I will do everything possible, together with you, to ensure that we have access to her and that she has access to her family and to her lawyers. I will also make sure, together with you, that the Court of Cassation will offer a different picture of justice and the rule of law in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also care about her as a politician and my motto here is that, whatever the political responsibility – and there were many she had to deal with when she was Prime Minister – whenever we are talking about political responsibility, the right arena is not a court or prison but an open arena and elections. Whenever there is the possibility of criminal responsibility, or talk of criminal responsibility, beyond any doubt, all preconditions need to be in place for the rule of law to deliver and for there to be a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a fifth and last remark. Yulia Tymoshenko herself has asked that her case should not be used as an excuse to slow the association process. We respect that. At the same time, we demand that Ukraine show that it respects the spirit of our new agreement before we can confidently open the way to allow its entry into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All arguments by supporters of Yulia Tymoshenko and supporters of strict diktats towards the current government of Ukraine resemble hysteria more than debates. We should be guided only by facts and not engage in political advertising of Yulia Tymoshenko, who lost the elections. I am sure that, if the court reached a verdict that Ms Tymoshenko is guilty, she should be subjected to punishment accordingly. I am sure that efforts to put the former prime minister beyond the law represent interference in the domestic affairs of Ukraine. I am sure that the political struggle should not become a clown-style activity. 48 million Ukrainian citizens are waiting for change but instead, they see every day the Yulia Tymoshenko soap opera. I will vote against the resolution and all other texts on Ukraine if they contain silly points and emotions. I am confident that the appeal from Catherine Ashton to boycott Euro 2012 is an irresponsible move that will drive Ukraine away from the EU. I appeal to all MEPs to make a statement regarding that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A year ago, on 9 June 2011, we were already sounding an alarm bell about the selective nature of the judicial inquiries being conducted into the former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, and some of the members of the government that she led. Unfortunately, we are obliged to return to this topic and call once again on the Ukrainian authorities to demonstrate transparency and impartiality in the proceedings against Yulia Tymoshenko. As a member of the Council of Europe, Ukraine must comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The European Parliament has expressed its support on countless occasions for Ukraine’s integration into Europe. Achieving such a goal requires more than the Ukrainian people wanting integration. Political leaders in Kiev also need to act in a manner appropriate under the rule of law. I firmly believe that if Ukrainian politicians demonstrate political will, they will succeed in having the association agreement with the European Union adopted, which we would all like to see implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By involving itself in the assessment of Ms Tymoshenko’s case, the Parliament illegally acts as a court of appeal driven by a political rationale. Many of those who insist on sanctioning Ukraine have a hidden agenda unrelated to the human rights. They desire to stop the EU’s future enlargement by stopping Ukraine’s further EU integration. Likewise, these people want to freeze the grey international status quo of Ukraine by dividing its political operators into pro-Russians, left under Russian control, and pro-Europeans misled by empty promises. Special trade arrangements guaranteed by supporting certain political players in Ukraine could also be the motivation behind this approach. These do not reflect the European interest but some Member States’ interests or, at worst, those of some private groups. The European Parliament should reject such hidden agendas, while acknowledging that the EU is not strong enough to impose its wishes on Ukraine and that this country has other geopolitical alternatives than EU integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the Heritage Foundation’s 2012 Index, Ukraine’s economic freedom is the worst in Europe. Entrepreneurism is stifled by widespread corruption, with trade barriers and an unfriendly investment climate undermining economic growth. President Yanukovych has said that the current ‘pause’ in EU-Ukraine relations may actually benefit the two sides. I hope that Yanukovych uses this pause to reflect on whether detaining Tymoshenko is the best way of addressing corruption in his dysfunctional country. He needs to take a long hard look at the independence of the Ukrainian courts. He needs to ask himself whether a corrupt judiciary coupled with the incarceration of the leader of the opposition is the right way to fulfil the promise he made in 2010 for a Ukraine which was ‘a free state, where rights and freedoms are the highest values’. I hope that after hitting the ‘pause’ button, Yanukovych doesn’t choose to rewind. Otherwise, the EU will have to press ‘stop’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
