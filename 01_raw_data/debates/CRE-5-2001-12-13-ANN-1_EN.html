<p>On 4 November 2001, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Ecevit, reiterated the threat that Turkey would annex occupied northern Cyprus if Cyprus became a member of the EU. These statements were endorsed by the Turkish Foreign Minister and by the whole world of Turkish politics.</p>
<p>In the light of Parliament's recently adopted report on Turkey's progress towards accession, which was designed to send a message of encouragement from the EU to Turkey in the hope that it will meet the requirements and criteria of eligibility for accession to the EU, does the Council consider that Turkey has appreciated the message contained in the Lamassoure report and shown signs of a positive response? Does it interpret Turkey's position as a refusal to comply with its obligations as an applicant country? Does the Council intend to make clear to Turkey, in official form, that under these circumstances, the process of Turkey's accession to the EU will be suspended, bringing with it economic repercussions for relations between Turkey and the Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>What view does the Council take of these initiatives and declarations which were issued only a few days before the meeting between Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash creating a new climate of tension and seeking solutions outside the UN decision-making framework?

<p>The impression of the Council is that the Turkish Government’s reaction to the Lamassoure report was positive and that it considered the report to be objective and fair. The strategy document and the Commission’s 2001 regular report on Turkey’s progress towards accession were presented recently. On that occasion, the Turkish Government reiterated its determination to pursue its efforts to comply with the criteria for accession.</p>
<p>The European Union’s position on the Cyprus question is well known. The EU feels that a political settlement will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the Union but that this does not constitute a precondition for accession. In this connection, the EU strongly supports the process under way at the United Nations. This provided the framework for the meeting between President Clerides and Mr Denktash held in Nicosia on 4 December 2001.</p>
<p>The declarations made recently by Mr Denktash and certain Turkish leaders certainly did not help to create favourable conditions for the face to face meeting between President Clerides and Mr Denktash on 4 December. Nonetheless, the atmosphere at the meeting was constructive. Mr De Soto was also present. Initial indications of the results of the meeting suggest positive developments took place. The meeting may have revived the possibility of a settlement prior to accession. Both parties have actually announced that they will engage in direct talks starting in January 2002 with a view to arriving at a solution within six months.</p>
<p>In the light of the Council’s longstanding position on this matter, it is certainly true that the threat contained in the statements mentioned by the honourable Member does nothing to promote the search for and definition of a solution. The threat refers to annexing of the northern part of Cyprus if accession took place whilst the island was still divided. If such a threat were carried through, this would certainly present serious problems for international law, stability in the region and, of course, for relations between the Union and Turkey. Furthermore, the Council has repeatedly made it clear to Turkey that threats of any sort are unhelpful in the search for a solution. On the occasion of his visit to Ankara on 27 November, the President-in-Office of the European Council reiterated this position and so did I during my visit on 4 December. Nonetheless, the Council is not taking this as a working hypothesis and the Union is pursuing its efforts in the hope of pre-empting such a situation. To this end, the Union is taking advantage of every contact with the Turkish Government to restate the need for a fair and lasting solution and its determination to find one.</p>
<p>The questions posed by the honourable Members provide me with the opportunity of informing you of the impressions I formed during my meetings in Ankara with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Yilmaz, and with the Foreign Minister, Mr Ismaïl Cem, and also during my meetings in Nicosia with President Clerides, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktash, the Foreign Minister, Mr Kasoulides, the Chief Negotiator, Mr Vassiliou and the Speaker of the Parliament, Mr Chistofias. These meetings were held on 4 and 5 December respectively. I must say, first of all, that my Turkish counterparts welcomed the meeting between Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash, and also its outcome when that became known. For the record, it was Mr Cem himself who informed me of it. What Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash agreed, witnessed by Mr De Soto, the United Nations’ Secretary-General’s special envoy, is as follows:</p>
<p>to begin negotiations in mid-January 2002, without preconditions</p>
<p>to negotiate in good faith until a comprehensive settlement is reached</p>
<p>that there will be no partial agreements, only a comprehensive one</p>
<p>that all issues will be open for discussion</p>
<p>President Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktash, gave me their separate accounts of the meeting on 4 December. Their versions were remarkably alike. I therefore venture to conclude that they interpreted events in a very similar, if not identical manner. I believe that is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Before concluding, I should like to add that Mr Denktash informed me that he is no longer opposed to the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, on condition that the whole island and its entire population are able to accede to it.</p>
<p>As had already been explained by President Prodi a few days earlier, I stressed that the European Union does not interfere with constitutional arrangements in Member States, provided, of course, that such arrangements are in line with our values and fundamental principles. I also stated that the accession procedures could be adjusted. It is still too early to congratulate ourselves. Fresh hope has all too often been stifled in Cyprus. Nonetheless the signs are promising. As you may imagine, I urged all those I met to keep to the course they have just set themselves. In so doing I spoke on behalf of Belgium and of the Union. Hopefully this will result in great benefit for Cyprus, the countries of the area and the Union as a whole. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the Presidency's term of office, the Belgian Premier, Mr Verhofstadt, announced on its behalf that the problems in Central Africa would be treated with the highest priority in the months to come. But on the agenda of the Council of Ministers for Development Cooperation of 8 November 2001, no explicit reference is made to that region, and the agenda includes only a submission of the results of a general seminar held in October on assistance to ACP countries engaged in conflict and in vulnerable condition.</p>
<p>Can the Presidency explain why no specific discussion of Central Africa has been included on that agenda? On what basis were priorities determined?</p>
<p>nswer</p>
<p>The problems in Central Africa have indeed been given the highest priority throughout the term of the Belgian presidency of the EU Council, as Prime Minister Verhofstadt announced at the presentation of the agenda of the presidency.</p>
<p>It is true that this point was not included as such in the agenda of the Council for Development Cooperation on 8 November. However, I recall that the Council adopted important conclusions concerning the improvement of the EU’s performance in the framework of development cooperation with those ACS countries that are involved in crises or conflicts. It is understood that those conclusions primarily concern the countries of Central Africa. I would also point out that the Council for Development Cooperation, on the initiative of the presidency, has agreed to continue working towards the adoption of relevant operational conclusions at its next sitting.</p>
<p>As you know, the Council for General Affairs debated five times (on 16 July, 8 October, 29 October, 19 November and 10 December) the situation in Central Africa and adopted many conclusions. During all of those debates, the question of European support was considered. The General Affairs Council has therefore fulfilled its role as general policy maker and coordinator.</p>
<p>Concerning the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Council has declared its active support of the renewed peace efforts based on the agreement of Lusaka concerning the ceasefire and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. The Council has closely followed the situation in Rwanda and on 19 November specified a new collective standpoint with regard to Rwanda. Concerning Burundi, the Council provided intense diplomatic endeavours in support of the formation, on 1 November 2001, of an interim government of national unity. The Council is convinced that the peace process can and must succeed. It has adopted a collective approach concerning Burundi and will continue its political and financial support for the Arusha peace process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to add that a ministerial troika under the leadership of the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Louis Michel, visited the countries of Central Africa and Zimbabwe from 20 to 25 November. The General Affairs Council of 10 December was informed of the results of the troika’s visit and held an exchange of ideas concerning this.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2001 Parliament's Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America travelled to El Salvador and Cuba to assess the situation in those two countries on the spot. During the various meetings held in Cuba, NGOs, European representatives and Cuban 'dissidents' expressed the view that the current EU Common Position on Cuba was not helpful for either Cuba or Europe, or for the development of bilateral economic relations between individual Member States and Cuba.</p>
<p>Whilst welcoming the Belgian Presidency's initiatives and the interest it has shown in resuming the dialogue with the only Latin American country with which the EU has not signed a cooperation agreement, what steps will the Council take to update the Common Position as part of the forthcoming review process, bringing it more closely into line with the economic ties and bonds of friendship linking the various Member States and Cuba?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The House is once again calling on the Presidency of the Council to speak on the issue of relations between Cuba and the European Union. The matter was also raised at the November sitting.</p>
<p>As the House will be aware, during its term in office the Belgian Presidency made a great effort to resume dialogue with Cuba. The dialogue had been interrupted by the Cuban authorities, when they cancelled the meeting with the European Union troika planned for April 2000. Mr Louis Michel, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Belgium, has met with Mr Perez Roque, his Cuban counterpart, on three occasions since July of this year.</p>
<p>Mr Michel held a bilateral meeting with his counterpart on 10 July in Brussels. Subsequently, in his capacity as Head of the European Union’s troika exploratory mission, he met Mr Perez Roque in Havana on 23 and 24 August. A further meeting took place on 12 November on the fringe of the United Nations’ 56<span class="sup">th</span> General Assembly, in the presence of the High Representative, Mr Solana, the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Piqué, and the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten. Finally, the troika led by Mr Jan de Bock, Secretary-General of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Havana again on 1 and 2 December this year.</p>
<p>All these meetings provided opportunities for frank and constructive dialogue on all matters of common interest.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 10 and 11 December, the General Affairs Council undertook its tenth assessment of the European Union’s common position.</p>
<p>The Council took note of the efforts made in recent months to engage in frank and constructive dialogue on all matters of common interest. These are in line with its Conclusions following the ninth assessment of the common Position last June.</p>
<p>The Council reiterated that the European Union’s objectives with regard to Cuba remain unchanged. The Union remains committed to encouraging a process of transition towards democratic pluralism and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and raising the standard of living of the Cuban people.</p>
<p>Following detailed study and exchange of information, particularly during the recent political dialogue between the Union’s troika and Cuba, the Council has found that serious shortcomings still exist in Cuba regarding recognition and implementation of civil and political liberties. In addition, the Cuban authorities will not countenance reforms aimed at setting up a political system based on these values. Nonetheless, the Union has taken note of some encouraging signals in this regard, namely increased religious freedom, non-implementation of the death penalty during the last two years, a considerable fall in the number of political prisoners and increased ratification of United Nations instruments in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>Further, the Council welcomes the decision taken by the Cuban Parliament at its sitting on 4 October to approve Cuba’s acceptance of all UN conventions against terrorism.</p>
<p>Consequently the Council believes that the common position is still valid and remains the basis of the European Union’s policy towards Cuba. The Council considers that it is essential to pursue the current dialogue in the hope of achieving specific results, especially as regards future cooperation based on respect for democratic principles, human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. In this connection, the Council would point out that it is hoping for significant indications from the Cuban Government with regard to attaining the objectives of the common position.</p>
<p>The Council recalls the importance attached by the United Nations to Cuba’s endorsement of the principles contained in the United Nations’ Convention on civil and political rights and also in its Convention on economic, social and cultural rights. It earnestly hopes that Cuba will be able to sign these Conventions at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>In connection with the economic difficulties Cuba is currently experiencing, the Council wishes to emphasise the significant contribution increased economic, trading and tourist exchanges between Cuba and the countries of the European Union could make to improving the situation in Cuba. To this end, the Council urges Cuba to broaden and deepen the economic and legal reforms already under way. Given the present situation, the Council is of the opinion that the European Union should strengthen its aid programme within Cuba, in particular through civil and non-governmental organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0891"></a>

These objectives were set for 2003.</p>
<p>In accordance with the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council in June, a ministerial conference dealing with offers of undertakings of police capacity was held in Brussels on 19 November this year. At this conference the Member States undertook to provide 5 000 police officers by 2003, 1 400 of whom could be deployed in less than 30 days.</p>

<p>1. The Council has, among others actions, established the following guiding principles for the EU's policy with regard to Afghanistan<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>provision of emergency humanitarian aid remains an absolute priority for the Union;</p>
<p>support for a stable, legitimate and broad-based government with adequate representation of women and respect of their human rights;</p>
<p>ensuring women's full participation in building the future of this country;</p>
<p>full support for the efforts of M.Brahimi, the UNSG Special Representative;</p>
<p>responsible behaviour of the new Afghan leaders will constitute a deciding factor for the aid which the European Union is prepared to provide for the country's reconstruction.</p>
<p>These principles are in accordance with the resolution quoted by the honourable Member, that the Council has taken note of, during its session of 19/20 November 2001.</p>
<p>2. The Council instructed the Presidency and the Commission to make contact without delay with the international community and in particular the Secretary General of the United Nations and his Personal Representative in order to contribute effectively to the UN efforts.</p>
<p>3. While recognising the primary responsibility of the Afghan people in determining its future, the Council called on the United Nations and international financial institutions to devise a plan for the economic, social and institutional reconstruction of Afghanistan. Ministers underlined that such a plan must particularly promote the role of women in Afghan society.</p>
<p>4. The Council also decided to appoint a Special Representative who will contribute to the implementation of the EU's policy in Afghanistan. The Special Representative will advise the General Secretary/High Representative for CFSP Mr Solana and the Council of the progress of the Afghan factions and the transitional administration - when established - in key areas, including:</p>
<p>respect for the human rights of all Afghan people, regardless of gender, ethnicity or religion;</p>
<p>respect for democratic principles, the rule of law, the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rights of women and children, and fundamental freedoms and the principles of international law;</p>
<p>fostering of participation by women in public administration and society.</p>
<p>5. The EU takes part actively in meetings on reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, specifically in the Senior Officials meeting on reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan (Washington, 20 November 2001), the conference "preparing for the reconstruction of Afghanistan" co-hosted by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the Asian Development Bank (Islamabad, Pakistan, 27-29 November 2001), the meeting of the Afghanistan Support Group (Berlin 6 December 2001). The EU, as a co-chair of the steering group established in Washington will organise a Donors conference in Brussels (21 December) in preparation of the pledging session at Ministerial level scheduled in Tokyo end of January 2002.</p>
<p>6. The EU in this context has also stepped up its political dialogue with the countries in the region and beyond.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member states in his question, this is an issue between two Member States. The Council is not competent to become involved in its own right.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the negotiations planned by Spain and the United Kingdom with a view to arriving at an acceptable solution to this question. The understanding is that it is up to the two countries concerned to establish the conditions on which the populations and entities involved may or may not participate in the process. Such arrangements should be in line with the law and accepted custom and in the interests of a fair solution. In this connection, the Council would remind the honourable Member that, on the occasion of the signature of letters of agreement between Spain and the United Kingdom in the spring of 2000, letters concerning a number of issues affecting Gibraltar, one of the issues the letters dealt with was, in fact, that of the authority competent to represent Gibraltar.</p>
<p>An agreement came into force on 1 June 2000, concerning Gibraltarian authorities in the context of European Union and European Community instruments and related Treaties. The agreement is contained in document 7998/00 JAI 45 MI 73.

<p>As the honourable Member is aware, since the tragic events of 11 September and following the informal Extraordinary European Council held on 21 September, the fight against terrorism has become one of the Council’s main priorities. A great deal of action is under way and much has already been accomplished.

<p>At the Stockholm summit the European Council stated that: 'Regaining full employment not only involves focusing on more jobs, but also on better jobs…' by increasing efforts to promote health and safety at the workplace, inter alia.</p>
<p>Pending the adoption of indicators regarding the quality of work, does the Council intend to set specific quality targets for reducing the number of industrial accidents and illnesses due to both traditional and new hazards?</p>
<p>According to EUROSTAT research, the average percentage of accidents which are reported in the EU is 89%, while the corresponding figures for Ireland and Greece are 38% and 39%, respectively, which is very alarming. What measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that accidents at the workplace are reported?</p>
<p>1. The Council would remind the honourable Member that at its meeting in Lisbon on 23/24 March 2000, the European Council set the general objective of progress towards full employment by creating not only more jobs but also better jobs.</p>
<p>At Nice, it specified that in all areas of social policy, the European social agenda should focus on promoting quality, all aspects of which are essential to enable the European Union to attain the objectives it set itself regarding competitiveness and full employment.</p>
<p>More recently, at Stockholm, the Council highlighted that ‘regaining full employment not only involves focusing on more jobs but also on better jobs’.</p>
<p>It was therefore appropriate to include the quality of work amongst the general objectives of the guidelines for employment in 2002. Further, the Council cooperated with the Commission to develop indicators regarding the quality of work, and set quantitative indicators in good time for the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p>2. At its meeting of 8 October 2001, the Council invited the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to pursue its work on indicators regarding the quality of work. On that occasion, ministers highlighted the need for reliable indicators based on comparable data. Health and safety at the workplace emerged as one of the indicators likely to be agreed on at an early stage.</p>
<p>3. On 3 December 2001, the Chairman of the Committee on Employment presented the report on indicators to the Council. This was followed by an exchange of views. In this report, the Committee on Employment recommended 8 key indicators, based on 10 fields. The latter are those adopted by the Commission in its communication dated 20 June 2001, together with 23 complementary context indicators. It should be noted that the fourth field is, in fact, health and safety at the workplace.</p>
<p>These indicators are to be assessed in their own right and also within the framework of an ongoing process, and were approved by the Council. The Council decided to forward them to the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001. Further, it called for the indicators to be integrated into European employment strategy as from 2002. It was also of the opinion that the indicators should be applied to the assessment of national action plans for employment at the earliest opportunity. February 2002 was set as the date for review by the Committee on Employment of indicators already defined and for the Committee to assess their specific application in the context of the study of national action plans.</p>
<p>4. Concerning the specific question of measures to ensure that accidents at the workplace and occupational illnesses are reduced and reported, the Council reminds the honourable Member that it is for the various actors concerned to collaborate in order to improve conditions at the workplace and to protect the health and safety of the workers. Primary responsibility lies with the Member States to act within the framework of their national policy. Pursuant to the Treaty (Article 137 (1) (1)) the Community is charged with supporting and enhancing their action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 21 November 2001, a peaceful demonstration with banners reading 'Truth, Compassion, Forbearance' was held in support of the persecuted meditation movement, Falun Gong, in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The 36 demonstrators came from ten different countries, including Sweden, the UK, France, Spain, Ireland. Switzerland, Israel, Canada and the USA.

<p>The European Union remains concerned about the continuing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China, including restrictions on freedom of religion and faith and also on freedom of expression and association. The Union regularly makes the Chinese authorities aware of its concerns, notably in the framework of the European Union-China dialogue on human rights. For instance, during the latest round of the dialogue on 25 and 26 October this year, it urged the Chinese side to respect the human rights and human dignity of all individuals. The Chinese authorities were strongly encouraged to respect these rights in full, regardless of an individual’s religion, convictions or membership of any movement. The European Union troika of political directors raised this issue again in Beijing on 30 November, together with a number of other issues relating to human rights. The troika expressed its concern over information received concerning the severity of the treatment meted out to Falun Gong members and others. The Chinese side was urged to take steps to ensure that human rights are fully respected and that individual freedoms may be enjoyed without restrictions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0916"></a>

<p>The world conference on racism wound up its proceedings on 8 September 2001, when four separate documents were adopted by consensus. These were: a political declaration, an action programme, a document on the Middle East and a document on the past. The United Nations Secretariat was charged with finalising the documents and consequently with integrating the documents on the Middle East and the past into the declaration and the action programme.</p>
<p>The Secretariat duly circulated a draft final document on 24 September. At the request of the Mrs Zuma, Chairman of the conference and Foreign Minister of South Africa, in this document ten paragraphs on the past were incorporated into the declaration and the remaining four were incorporated into the action programme. The European Union accepted the proposed text subject to a few technical modifications.</p>
<p>Following this first version, at the request of the African Group the conference Chairman made an additional request, namely that three further paragraphs concerning the past be included in the action programme. Such an adjustment has a bearing on the substance of the consensus reached at Durban as it introduces a moral obligation to increase international aid in compensation for the past, notably slavery and specific aspects of colonialism. This is unacceptable to the European Union. Indeed, the European Union has always rejected any link between its development aid and past events. Recognition of such a link would change the spirit in which such aid is implemented. Canada raised similar objections. Mary Robinson referred the problem to the United Nations’ legal services, and asked for their opinion on the request made by the Chairman of the conference. In the legal services’ view, the African Group’s request is unacceptable as it is not in line with the agreement reached at Durban.</p>
<p>Taking this into account, the Secretariat then published a second draft text on 25 October. The European Union indicated its agreement with this second draft. The African Group objected, however. It rejected the United Nations’ legal opinion and maintained its position, thus continuing to block the process of finalising the texts relating to the Durban Conference.</p>
<p>Despite repeated efforts by Mary Robinson to find a compromise solution, the African Group remains isolated and has not yet agreed to the text. As far as the Union and many other participants are concerned, the Durban negotiations concluded with a consensus. It is therefore impossible to revise that agreement or to alter its substance without adversely affecting that spirit of compromise and good faith which has always prevailed at world conferences organised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The difference of opinion arose between the African Group and the Conference’s Secretariat, a function exercised by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights. The European Union is not therefore party to the disagreement and cannot initiate any action in its own right.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Union is very concerned about the delay experienced in final endorsement of the Durban texts by the United Nations’ General Assembly. This delay could hamper the implementation of the action programme against racism in the world. The European Union has therefore requested the United Nations’ Secretary-General to arbitrate on the matter. The Union trusts that his intervention will help to resolve these difficulties. It is certainly crucially important not to detract from the success achieved at Durban. The consensus reached by all participants on efforts to combat racism must also be safeguarded.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0918"></a>

<p>The Council attaches great importance to the development of European inland waterways as a means to obtain a better balance between various modes of transport and contribute to reduce traffic congestion. As a safe and environmentally friendly transport mode, inland navigation has the potential to play an important role in regional, national and local transport of freight and passengers and in facilitating inter-modal transport.</p>
<p>The Council also acknowledges the multifunctional role of canals and waterways, particularly their environmental importance as a fundamental part of the landscape in many parts of Europe and as a part of river and wetland ecosystems. The recreational values of inland waterways and canals offer significant opportunities for the European tourism industry.</p>
<p>Against this background, the development of inland waterways is one of the main objectives of the Community's transport policy and of the trans-European transport networks. With an amendment approved in May 2001, more inland ports became entitled to funding in this context. The need to maintain and further develop inland waterway networks will be one among the issues to be discussed in the revision of the guidelines for the trans-European transport networks, for which the Commission just presented its proposal.</p>
<p>In fact, the Göteborg European Council (15-16 June 2001) invited the European Parliament and the Council to give priority, among other things, to infrastructure investment for inland waterways in the revised guidelines for the trans-European transport networks which should be adopted by 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0923"></a>

<p>1. In pursuit of the objectives laid down in Lisbon, the Stockholm European Council of 23 and 24 March 2001 decided that improving basic skills, particularly IT and digital skills, was a top priority to make the Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. It also decided that this priority should include education policies and lifelong learning as well as overcoming the present shortfall in the recruitment of scientific and technical staff.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, the Council and the Commission were instructed to submit to the Spring European Council in 2002 a report containing a detailed work programme on the follow-up of the objectives regarding education and training systems, including an assessment of their achievement in the framework of the open method of coordination and in a worldwide perspective.</p>
<p>In this report, the Council and the Commission must give special attention to ways and means of encouraging young people, especially women, in scientific and technical studies as well as ensuring the long-term recruitment of qualified teachers in these fields.</p>

This report is to be considered by the Employment and Social Affairs Council at its meeting on 7 March 2001.</p>

<p>In its Economic and Finance, Employment and Social Policy, and Environment configurations, the Council has already arrived at conclusions on the structural indicators proposed by the Commission. These conclusions were presented to the General Affairs Council with a view to them subsequently being passed to the European Council.</p>
<p>In the context of the debate held yesterday, 10 December 2001, on the current situation regarding work in other configurations of the Council, the General Affairs Council stated that it was pleased with what had been accomplished.

<p>In view of the Commission Green Paper on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the events of 11 September 2001, public interest in the role of transnational companies in relation to human rights and social responsibility is on the increase. A number of questions arise, to which a speedy response is required.</p>
<p>Is the Council prepared to allot greater importance to human rights and 'social responsibility' in respect of transnational undertakings, and what specific action is being planned?</p>
<p>Is the Council monitoring compliance with existing codes of conduct in social matters transnational undertakings, and what measures are being taken to step up compliance with those codes of conduct?</p>

<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that the Lisbon European Council appealed to the sense of corporate social responsibility of enterprises with regard to best practice in respect of lifelong education and training, the organisation of work, equality of opportunity, social integration and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is also reminded that, in the context of the implementation of the European social agenda, the Nice European Council invited the Commission to involve enterprises in establishing an effective partnership with the social partners, with a view to reinforcing the social responsibility of the former. Non-governmental organisations, local authorities and bodies administering social services were also to be involved. The Stockholm European Council expressed its satisfaction with the initiatives taken by enterprises to promote their corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>Clearly therefore, the Council attaches great importance to human rights and to corporate social responsibility. Consequently, it welcomed the Commission’s recent Green Paper.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the procedure for following up a Green Paper requires the Council to wait for responses from interested parties. These responses are due by 31 December 2001. Specific conclusions will then be drawn up. In the mean time, Member States are also invited to conduct broad consultations at national level.</p>
<p>The Council is not competent to monitor existing codes of conduct in transnational undertakings directly. Insofar as such codes are affected by Community acts, responsibility for monitoring rests with the Commission.</p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency attaches special importance to the issue of corporate social responsibility. Hence it organised a conference on the subject, in cooperation with the Commission and in the framework of the general consultation referred to above. The conference took place in Brussels on 27 and 28 November 2001.</p>
<p>The Presidency also presented a draft resolution to the Council. This was approved at the Employment and Social Policy Council meeting on 3 December 2001. In presenting this draft resolution, the Presidency wished to highlight the positive consequences corporate social responsibility can have. For instance, it can help to attain objectives in the field of European strategies for employment and social cohesion, as regards anticipating and managing change. It can also help to manage the consequences of economic and social integration for employment and society, and to adjust working conditions to the new economy, notably by promoting the quality of work. In addition, the Presidency wished to highlight the contribution that development of corporate social responsibility could make to the sustainable development strategy drawn up by the Gothenburg European Council. In this connection, the Presidency believes it is important to involve the Commission and the Member States together with the social partners in the promotion of initiatives and new ventures relating to corporate social responsibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0936"></a>

<p>In the conclusions adopted on 15 November 2001, the Council recognised that stress and depression-related problems are a factor of major importance which contributes in a significant way to the burden of disease and reduces quality of life. It recognised also that there is a need to develop research and methods for intervention in this field and that it is important to promote mental health and prevent stress and depression through actions across all policies and activities, particularly as regards stress and depression determinants. It also noted that there is a need to enhance the visibility of these problems, with a view to their prevention, early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>The Council further underlined that it is important to cooperate with the World Health Organisation and other relevant international organisations in the field of mental health and in particular on stress and depression-related problems, as well as addressing this problem in the framework of cooperation with the applicant countries.</p>
<p>The Member States were invited to give attention to the impact of stress and depression related problems, in particular of work-related stress and depression and ensure that these problems are recognised; to take actions to improve knowledge on the promotion of mental health and the prevention of stress and depression-related problems in primary care, other health services and social services; to collect and share good quality data with other Member States and the Commission; to develop, implement and evaluate actions to prevent such problems and to promote the exchange of good practices and joint projects within the Member States.</p>
<p>In the context of the programmes of action in the field of public health, the Commission was invited to facilitate the collection of comparable data on the characteristics, determinants and causes of stress and depression; to consider undertaking activities, such as facilitating exchange of information and experience concerning recognition, prevention and monitoring of stress and depression-related problems; to consider how preventive action could be achieved in the definition and implementation of relevant Community policies and activities to complement national policies; and to consider developing strategies for the prevention of stress and depression-related problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0941"></a>

<p>On 20 September, the Council took the decision to strengthen cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism, following the tragic events of 11 September. The European Council reaffirmed this decision when the subsequent action plan against terrorism was adopted.</p>
<p>The Council believes that the fight against terrorism must not be conducted at the expense of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is those very rights and freedoms that terrorists are intent on attacking. The fight against terrorism is not, therefore, a threat to human rights. On the contrary, it aims to defend them. This is the context in which anti-terrorist measures should be assessed, including cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>A number of issues raised by the honourable Member concern bilateral relations between Member States and the United States. Nonetheless, the Council wishes to emphasise that when personal data is supplied to third countries, the conditions under which this takes place must be such as to guarantee an appropriate standard of data protection. Discussions aimed at ensuring such protection have been held with the United States, for example within the Europol framework. In addition, the Council has urged the authorities in the United States to avoid unilateral measures in relation, for instance, to the safety of air transport. The US has been encouraged to continue its dialogue with the Union.</p>
<p>Regarding extradition, it follows from the European Convention on Human Rights and the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, and is indeed normal practice within the European Union, that Member States do not extradite individuals to countries where the death penalty is still enforced. Individuals are only extradited if a guarantee is obtained ensuring that if the person in question is found guilty, the death penalty will not be called for and certainly not enforced. As for military tribunals, the Union does not have an official position on the subject. It is, however, clear that extradition to countries where the requirements for a just and fair trial could not be met would present a political problem for Member States. The Union has already made its concerns on this issue clear to the United States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0946"></a>

In this way, efforts are being made to satisfy Turkey's demands for non-intervention by the European forces in hostilities involving NATO countries, reflecting the position of NATO and the WEU. This once more raised the question of possible disputes between Greece and Turkey regarding the non-involvement of European forces in conflicts, the resolution of which is the responsibility of the UN and the involvement of Turkey in decisions concerning its vital interests.</p>

<p>Turkey has indeed claimed the right to participate in operations undertaken by the European Union without NATO involvement, should Ankara feel that its security interests are affected. Turkey opposed making NATO equipment and facilities available to European Union operations in the hope of achieving recognition of its claim.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is in the interests of the European Union to find a solution to this problem. It is equally clear, of course, that any solution must take into account the interests of the Union as a whole and also of each individual Member State. This approach was confirmed at the Nice European Council. It remains valid and will continue to be so.</p>
<p>In this connection, according to statements made by the Turkish Government on 2 December, a way forward may be found on the basis of informal efforts undertaken by the United Kingdom with the support of the United States. In any case, it will be for the Council to study the provisions when all the details are known. The Council will take a decision once the study is completed.</p>
<p>Regarding possible conflicts in the Aegean Sea and Cyprus, and the position to be adopted by the European Union should such conflicts take place, the Council does not feel it is helpful to make statements on what it believes are merely hypothetical scenarios.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0867"></a>

<p>Despite the measures taken by the Member States and the European Union, piracy and the illegal copying of music on to cassettes and CDs has become widespread. As a result, very large sums of money are bypassing the European economy and the originators of the music, being directly affected, are facing financial ruin.</p>
<p>Economic crime in the form of piracy, stealing ideas, and counterfeit products is thriving. It is a scourge which has direct links to money laundering, smuggling and drug trafficking. Moreover, in this age of modern advanced technology, organised economic crime has highly sophisticated resources at its disposal, making it difficult to fight.</p>
<p>In the Commission's estimate, how high is the turnover from economic crime involving abuse of copyright? What further measures is the Commission planning to combat this veritable scourge afflicting consumers and, above all, the originators of the music?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property and takes the problems of counterfeiting and piracy within the European Union very seriously. Such activity does indeed have a negative effect on the operation of the internal market and threatens innovation, creativity, employment and competitiveness. Moreover, counterfeiting and piracy are becoming more and more closely connected with organised crime. At the end of the day, the costs are borne by the consumers and by society as a whole.</p>
<p>According to statistics provided by the International Chamber of Commerce, counterfeiting and piracy represent 5 to 7% of world trade at a cost of EUR 200 to 300 billion per year. Total job losses amount to 200 000 per year. At European level, interested parties estimate that rights holders operating at international level incur losses of EUR 400 to 800 million in the internal market and EUR 2 000 million outside the Union. Furthermore, in view of the illegal nature of these activities, it is difficult to assess the real economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy on the internal market, although the statistics supplied by the parties affected suggest that the scale of these activities is already considerable and continues to increase.</p>
<p>The Commission has not stood passively by and allowed such activity to develop. In 1988, a consultation process was launched by means of a Green Paper on the fight against counterfeiting and piracy. Parliament made a considerable contribution to this process. On completion of the latter, the Commission adopted a follow-up communication in November 2000. This contained an ambitious action plan to improve and intensify the fight against this phenomenon in the internal market.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives the Commission included in this plan of action is a draft directive aimed at strengthening the means to ensure intellectual property rights are respected and defining a general framework for the exchange of information and administrative cooperation. The draft directive is due to be presented early in 2002. Naturally, the European Parliament will be called upon to play a significant role in this connection. The action plan includes several other initiatives. Chief amongst these are a study aimed at defining a methodology for the collection, analysis and comparison of data relating to counterfeiting and piracy, the training of personnel to combat fraud and technical assistance to the candidate countries.</p>
<p>Clearly, for the action plan to succeed, all the actors concerned must be involved, especially holders of intellectual property rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0872"></a>

<p>Since the Commission proposals relating to traceability and labelling of GMOs were adopted in July 2001, the Commission has held meetings with Member States to discuss these proposals. Last September, the Commission made public the fact that it would not lift the moratorium before the EU had a sound legal basis on authorisation of experimental dissemination and marketing.</p>
<p>On 16 October last, the Commission proposed a lifting of the moratorium via an interim approach consisting of voluntary agreements of compliance with Directive 2001/18/EC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, between the biotech industry and the Commission. This was rejected by some Member States.</p>
<p>Could the Commission outline what is its alternative strategy regarding its plans to lift the moratorium and which Member States oppose lifting the moratorium? Would the Commission consider introducing environmental liability regimes as well as ensure that the new rules laid down in the 2001/18/EC Directive are implemented in all Member States before envisaging sanctioning new GMOs?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the context of the revision of Directive 90/220/EEC, a number of Member States have continued to point towards the need to implement a more transparent and strict regulatory framework for the authorisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and to the importance of the Commission submitting full draft rules ensuring labelling and traceability of GMOs and products produced from GMOs. Some Member States have further indicated that, pending the adoption of such rules, they would take steps to have any new authorisations suspended. This has lead to a de facto moratorium on new approvals of GMOs.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission committed to supplement the revised Directive 90/220/EEC with Proposals concerning the labelling and traceability of both GMOs and products produced from GMOs. On 25 July 2001, the Commission adopted two Proposals that include both labelling and traceability requirements for GMOs and products produced from GMOs.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, the Commission has re-assessed the prospect for re-starting the authorisation procedure in line with the new framework. Indeed the lack of new approvals without any legal basis is creating an increasingly difficult situation from an internal market point of view and for international trade. In addition, the current standstill is also a major issue in terms of the impact on European industry, agriculture and research.</p>
<p>However, it has become increasingly apparent, following the technical meeting with Member States on 16 October 2001 and the subsequent Environment Council on 29 October 2001, that a number of Member States require the systems for labelling and traceability to be in place.</p>
<p>The Commission is considering its options in light of this situation, which will also require that Member States examine their own roles and responsibilities in terms of the approval of new products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission published its open competition COM/A/8/01 (Official Journal C 201 A) for the recruitment of a candidate to fill the post of Head of the Commission’s Representation in London on 17 July 2001.</p>
<p>Among the eligibility criteria specified for the competition was one relating to age limits. It required that candidates had to have been born after 7 September 1945, thereby setting a maximum age of 56 years (not 45 years as the honourable Member alleges in her Question). The application of age limits is legally founded on Article 1 point g) of Annex III to the Staff Regulations and the Commission does not, therefore, consider the use of an age limit to be a matter of maladministration.</p>
<p>In January 1998, more than a year and a half before the Ombudsman launched his own initiative inquiry referred to by the honourable Member, the Commission agreed in principle to abandon age limits in its future notices of competition, but expressed the view that a co-ordinated approach was needed amongst all the European Institutions. As an interim measure the Commission also decided to raise the age limit from 35 years to 45 years for competitions for recruitment to basic grades. This was in line with the Parliament's approach. (It should be noted that other EU institutions also use age limits in their competitions, and that in some cases these are lower than 45 years.) For grades other than basic grades, age limits set down in Commission competitions may be 50 or 55 years, as is the case for the competition which gave rise to this question.</p>
<p>The Commission can also inform the honourable Member that, in accordance with actions 27, 29 and 50 of the March 2000 White Paper on Reforming the Commission, the Commission has proposed closer inter-Institutional co-operation on recruitment and one of the means of achieving that is through the creation of a European Recruitment Office which will organise competitions for all the European Institutions. At their meeting of 9 July 2001 the Secretaries-General of the European Institutions agreed that it would be the responsibility of the Management Board of this future Office to take a decision about age limits. The decision on preparing the establishment of such an Office was approved by the Commission on 30 October 2001 in the context of the adoption of the comprehensive package on the Reform of personnel policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0887"></a>

<p>The amounts of export refunds for the export of live animals engaged against the Community budget during recent years are the following:</p>
<p>GATT year 1999/2000: EUR 81.4 million (12% of the total refunds);</p>
<p>GATT year 2000/2001: EUR 35.7 million (9% of the total refunds);</p>
<p>current GATT year (situation till end October 2001): EUR 13.2 million (8% of the total refunds).</p>
<p>Refund rates are expressed per 100 kg live weight. During the same period the rates for bovine slaughter cattle were reduced by almost 30%. There are no refunds for pigs or horses.</p>
<p>On the question of the granting of export refunds for slaughter cattle the Commission shares the views of the Council, as expressed in its resolution of 19 June 2001 on welfare. The first objective to achieve is to sort out the deficiencies observed with the implementation of the existing legislation. There should be more control and severe sanctions if the existing legislation on welfare during transport is not correctly implemented, both as regards transport inside the Community and export to countries outside the EU.</p>
<p>For the Community it is fundamental to achieve a well-balanced solution to the different aspects of this question.</p>
<p>It is very important to underline that deleting the refund for live cattle will not convert the importing countries into meat importers. These countries are more likely to switch towards other cattle exporting nations, such as Australia. Today this country exports some 280 000 heads of slaughter cattle to countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Israel, etc.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission and the Member States, as is made clear in the EU Common Position on Afghanistan, attach the highest importance to the early establishment of a stable, legitimate and broad-based government in Afghanistan and to the recognition and promotion of equal rights of women in the country.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will be aware, on 5 December the Afghan factions, meeting in Bonn under the chairmanship of the UN Secretary General Special Representative Ambassador Brahimi, agreed on the setting up of an Interim Authority as of 22 December 2001. The Interim Authority will run the country in anticipation of the establishment of a Transitional Administration which will itself pave the way for a new constitution for Afghanistan in about two years time and free and fair elections some six months later.</p>
<p>The Interim Authority agreement was endorsed by the UNSCR on 6 December through UNSCR 1383. It refers to the role and participation of women in the new arrangements: Articles III A 3), IV 2) and V 4) specifically on the participation of women in the Interim Administration and the Emergency Loya Jirga.</p>
<p>In addition, this document and its annexes refer to the establishment of an independent Human Rights Commission (Art. III C 6), and the need for the Interim Authority and the Emergency Loya Jirga to act in accordance with the international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law to which Afghanistan is a party, Art. V 2). Furthermore, annex II sets out, as part of the role of the UN in the interim period (Annex II 6), the UN’s right to investigate human rights violations and its responsibility to develop and implement a programme of human rights education in the country.</p>
<p>The General Affairs Council (GAC) of 10 December endorsed this interim arrangement and called on all Afghans to implement the accord in its entirety.</p>
<p>The GAC also indicated EU determination to play a full role in the international efforts taken under the aegis of the UN to contribute to the reconstruction of the society and economy of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>At the Washington meeting on 20 November, the international donors community established an Afghanistan Reconstruction Steering Group of which EU is one of the four co-chairs, together with US, Japan and Saudi Arabia. A further meeting is to be held on 20/21 December in Brussels, co-hosted by the Commission and the Presidency. A donors’ Ministerial meeting is planned in Japan in January 2002.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it should be recognised that the road towards full representative democracy in Afghanistan will be long. It cannot be expected that the Afghan people, with little direct experience of democracy as it is understood in Europe, embrace new ideas on governance overnight. This process must be supported to the greatest extent possible, through involvement in projects and programmes to improve education, human rights and governance for all of Afghanistan citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission reportedly intends to ask the Court of Justice to examine whether the French law, Loi Evin, impedes the free movement of goods by banning alcohol advertising on TV. Since 1995, several sporting events involving French teams outside France have not been shown on TV because French advertisements for alcohol were on view. In Sweden, the consumer ombudsman has taken the magazine Gourmet to court for advertising alcohol. The Stockholm City Court requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice which replied that restricting freedom of movement was not an approved course of action but that human life and health could be taken into account if the restrictions concerned were proportionate. The final ruling has yet to be given by the City Court and the Commission's decision to ask the Court of Justice to examine France's alcohol laws is, therefore, important as a matter of principle for other Member States.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the French law constitutes a disproportionate obstacle to alcohol advertising and is not therefore consistent with the Treaty's objective of the free movement of goods? What implications will a court ruling have for other Member States which consider that human life and health must take precedence over the free movement of goods? What effect would broadening the scope for alcohol advertising have on the credibility of the EU programme on health and preventive measures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In reply to the honourable Member’s question, the Commission would like to point out that, on 25 July 2001, it lodged a complaint against France at the Court of Justice. The complaint concerned a number of restrictions arising from the implementation of the Loi Evin. These restrictions mean that French television channels may only broadcast sporting events taking place on the territory of other Member States on condition that all advertising hoardings or other types of advertising promoting alcoholic beverages are removed from the sporting venues concerned. The Commission is of the opinion that the services provided by the organisers of sporting events in Member States other than France, namely the sale of advertising space and televised programmes, and also the provision of sponsorship, are restricted out of proportion to the stated aim of promoting public health. The extra-territorial implications of the Loi Evin represent a disproportionate obstacle to the freedom to provide cross-border services. The free movement of goods was not at issue in this particular case.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is reminded that the Commission fully endorses the Loi Evin’s aim of protecting public health. The Commission is not in favour of broadening the scope of advertising for alcoholic beverages. Indeed, Directive 89/552/EE<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>C<span class="sup"> 1</span> a Council Directive dated 3 October 1989 aimed at coordinating certain legal, regulatory and administrative provisions of Member States relating to particular aspects of television broadcasting, and, most especially, Article 15 of this directive, contain stringent requirements regarding television advertising of alcoholic beverages. These provisions are still in force in Member States. Moreover, it is worth noting that, on 5 June 2001, at the Commission’s request, the Council adopted a recommendation concerning the consumption of alcohol by young people, especially children and teenagers. In addition, on 2 October this year, the Commission adopted a draft regulation on promotional sales. This regulation banned the supplying of free samples of alcoholic beverages to young people under 18 years of age.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>From the very beginning of the process of European integration, leaders of Member States have regularly held informal multilateral and bilateral meetings. Such meetings concern issues also dealt with by the institutions of the European Union. Sometimes, the meetings are held on a regular basis, as in the case of the Franco-German Summits or the meetings of the Prime Ministers of the Benelux countries. On other occasions, the meetings are of an impromptu nature. As they are essentially informal, the meetings are perfectly compatible in principle with the Treaties. Indeed, they can sometimes speed up a formal decision by the institutions by applying the procedures in the Treaties.</p>
<p>That said, it is wise to guard against allowing unofficial meetings of this nature attended by representatives of only a few Member States to replace unofficial meetings of the Council. The latter are intended to allow Members of Council the opportunity to exchange opinions on important issues without being constrained by the need to take a decision. It is particularly important not to allow those unofficial meetings to become the occasions on which, to all intents and purposes, Council decisions are taken. If this were to happen, it would obviously create confusion, undermine the normal functioning of the Council and therefore threaten the whole institutional edifice, which is based on a balance between the institutions and between the Member States.</p>
<p>Regarding the unofficial dinner on 4 November 2001, the Commission took note of the fact that it was held to bring together the Heads of State and Government of those Member States involved in military action in Afghanistan. This matter is not being dealt with by the Union’s institutions in view of the present state of development of the common foreign and security policy. The Commission does not, therefore, feel at all excluded by not having been invited. Furthermore, it had not asked to be present at the dinner.</p>
<p>The Commission appreciates that the Presidency and the Secretary-General of the Council/CFSP High Representative were anxious to attend the dinner in order to be able to keep the Council and the Commission abreast of the discussions. The Commission does, however, feel that their presence at such events might make it difficult to distinguish action taken by certain Member States from that taken by the European Union; this despite the fact that, on this occasion, the action taken by the Member States concerned was fully supported by the remaining Member States and by the Commission.

<p>At the Doha conference in November, it was clear how out of step EU agricultural export subsidies are with the necessary efforts to increase free trade and achieve a fairer world economic order. They make it difficult for developing countries to compete on equal terms, to the annoyance of the majority of WTO members. Though earlier reforms of the common agricultural policy have partly shifted aid away from export subsidies to direct payments, the situation remains unacceptable. In the final declaration at Doha, the European Union committed itself to submitting plans by 2003 at the latest for reforming the export subsidy system and ensuring market access.</p>
<p>Will the Commission explain what such plans will contain in practice? What initiatives is the Commission likely to take, and what is the time scale for implementing the plans after 2003?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Doha ministerial statement states that, without prejudice to the outcome of negotiations, the Member States will undertake to engage in global negotiations to reduce all types of export subsidies with a view to phasing them out.</p>
<p>This undertaking covers all types of export subsidies namely export restitutions, export credits, the misuse of food aid and uncompetitive practices by State enterprises. Other Members applying different types of export subsidies should take similar action. It would be unacceptable for the European Union to be the only party working towards reduction of this nature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must not underestimate the fact that, since the implementation of Agenda 2000, the European Union has already reduced the level of export restitutions significantly. In 1993, the figure was EUR 10 billion. At present, however, it is around EUR 5 billion.</p>
<p>Lastly, the WTO will not launch negotiations on technical methods regarding commercial aspects such as access to the market, internal support and export competitiveness and the uncompetitive aspects until early 2002. It is therefore premature to prejudge the European Union’s position on these technical aspects at present.

<p>A process of legalising prostitution is under way in many Member States, one aspect of which is the lifting of the ban on brothels, most recently in the largest Member State of the EU, Germany. In so doing, the state is sanctioning prostitution as a legal occupation. Nevertheless, it appears that few wish to acknowledge the link between legalised prostitution and the trafficking of women for the sex industry.</p>
<p>The exploitation of human beings in the sex industry is now a business without frontiers. It is expanding, searching for new global markets and ever younger victims. Weapons – and women – can be bought by mail order. Every year, 500 000 women and children, mainly from eastern Europe, are lured, duped or forced into coming to western Europe to be exploited in the sex trade. The EU has taken up the fight against this sex slave trade in women and children.</p>
<p>The Swedish Riksdag's position is that Swedish legislation against the buying of sexual services has meant that trafficking in women is not on the same scale as it is in other European countries. Does the Commission consider that such a link between trafficking and prostitution might exist? If so, what instruments does the Commission have with which to monitor developments and propose counter-measures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the honourable Member of Parliament that sexual exploitation of women through prostitution is an important element of the general phenomenon of trafficking as defined in accordance with the United Nations Protocol and the Union Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>Over the past years the Commission is actively engaged to develop a comprehensive policy to fight and to prevent trafficking in human beings over the past years. The Commission has especially made advantage of the new powers the Treaty of Amsterdam has referred to the Union in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Following a Commission's proposal the Council recently reached political agreement on a Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings. The Framework Decision sets for the first time equal standards in Europe and therefore ensures that no safe haven for traffickers in the EU exist.</p>
<p>The Union has to act within the limits of the powers conferred to it by the Treaties and it is bound to the principle of subsidiarity. The Treaty on European Union confers to the Union the power to take action in the area of police and judicial cooperation against serious organised and transnational crime. It does, however, not provide the Union with the legal competence to address the phenomenon of prostitution as such. The Member States therefore are responsible to determine their policy on prostitution.

<p>Investments for improvements to safety and working conditions are a priority for the Commission. Community financial aid will continue to be granted for these types of projects, which are of great importance for the protection of lives at sea.</p>
<p>The current Multiannuel Guidance Programme (MAGP) provisions allow for an increase in the objectives for reasons of safety provided that it does not result in an increase in fishing effort. This has proved to be difficult to implement, since any increase in capacity is likely to result in some increase in fishing effort. The aim of the MAGP is to reduce the overcapacity and excess fishing effort of the Community fleet, so allowing the objectives to be increased to take into account spaces devoted to safety undermines the purpose of the instrument. Moreover, the examination on a case by case basis of the precise nature of capacity increases and whether or not they are justified on the grounds of safety is better dealt with by the authorities responsible for the issue of the vessel certificates rather than the Commission.</p>
<p>In the Commission's view, vessels should be constructed or modernised to conform with certain minimum standards within the capacity ceilings fixed by the MAGP. This would ensure that safety is not compromised and at the same time contribute to the removal of excess capacity in the Community fleet.</p>
<p>The Commission could nevertheless accept keeping the possibility to increase the objectives for non-trawlers less than 12 metres overall length, where this is part of a programme to improve safety and not on a case by case basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0922"></a>

In 2002, the STOP II Programme will support a follow-up and extension of the IOM-report through a seminar on trafficking in unaccompanied minors in the Member States. Additional research on the situation in France, Greece and Spain will form part of the preparations of this seminar. The Commission is also soon expecting from the Defence for Children International in the Netherlands the report of a study focusing on all relevant elements of trafficking in children.</p>

<p>Firstly the Commission would like to make it clear that the reform of the sheep regime should not just be seen as a question of money. The replacement of the deficiency payment by a fixed premium will provide certainty to sheep farmers by helping them to better manage their businesses and make the most of market opportunities.</p>
<p>On the matter of the level of subsidy the Commission considers that the proposed premium of EUR 21 per ewe is a realistic proposal. It must also be born in mind that around 85% of sheep producers are eligible for the less-favoured area supplement of EUR 7.</p>
<p>However, a comparison between the sheep and beef sectors cannot be made on the basis of subsidy alone. The difference in the price level is significant and must enter into any economic assessment of the relative position of the two sectors. In 2000 the annual average price per 100 kg for steers, young bulls and heifers was around EUR 285. For lambs the average price for the same period per 100 kg was EUR 357. Furthermore, when considering their relative profitability it is necessary to take into account the shorter production cycle in the sheep sector, which allows for more flexibility, as well as the higher levels of investment that are needed in the beef sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0927"></a>

<p>The Islamic Republic of Mauritania (IRM) is best placed to provide details on what is the cost benefit to that country in relation to total extraction of fish stocks by EU trawlers. That said, it must be underlined that in addition to the financial compensation paid by the EU to the IRM, totalling EUR 430 million over the five years of the Protocol initialled in July 2001, the IRM derives other benefits from the agreement, such as the payment of ship-owners fees, the increasing use of Mauritanian crews by Community vessels, the landing of some catches by these vessels, etc.</p>
<p>The IRM, as the coastal state concerned, is, first and foremost, responsible for control and surveillance activities in its waters. In line with Community policies to promote and support sustainable fishing activities, the latest Mauritania protocol provides for Community funding for several specific actions aimed at strengthening and improving the surveillance capacities of the IRM. Moreover, several Member States, particularly Germany, have long-standing co-operation projects focusing also on the control and surveillance functions of the IRM.

<p>The Commission has been informed that the Irish authorities recently instituted legal proceedings against the United Kingdom pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning the authorisation and operation of the MOX plant at Sellafield. In connection with this legal action, a request for provisional measures has been lodged with the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, in Hamburg, that the British authorities immediate suspend the authorisation of the said MOX plant. The Commission’s Legal Service is currently assessing the situation from the legal point of view.</p>
<p>In the context of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, the general data on plans concerning the disposal of radioactive waste from the Sellafield Mox Plant were submitted by the British authorities to the Commission in August 1996, so that it could determine whether the implementation of such plan was liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
<p>The Commission assessed the impact to the environment of other Member States, and issued an Opinion on 11 February 1997 (OJ C 68, p. 4) in which it concluded that the implementation of the Sellafield MOX Plant would not be liable to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the above opinion, the actual authorisation for operation of the plant is a national competence. The Commission is nevertheless examining the compliance of the procedure for granting the authorisation with all provisions of the Basic Safety Standards Directive (96/29/EURATOM) and with the Directive on the assessment of the environmental impact (85/337/EEC).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0930"></a>

Spanish public opinion has naturally reacted to this situation with surprise, astonishment and indignation, at a time when EU countries are stepping up Community political and legislative efforts in the fight against terrorism (including a common definition of terrorism and the introduction of a European arrest warrant).

<p>The question what action should be taken against Mr Olano in France, must be seen as a question of maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of its internal security. Pursuant to Article 33 of the Treaty on the European Union it is the Member States themselves, in this case the French Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, which are responsible for what action should be taken to maintain law and order and to safeguard their internal security. The Commission can therefore not intervene in this specific matter. In addition, it should be noted that Mr Olano has been arrested.</p>
<p>In this context, it can be noted that the Commission has made proposals regarding the introduction of new framework decisions on combating terrorism and on the European arrest warrant. The framework decision on the European arrest warrant will be based on mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters. When a judicial authority in one Member State issues a European arrest warrant in order to obtain the surrender of person convicted or suspected of having committed an offence that is covered by the framework decision, the warrant must be recognised and executed in the entire territory of the Union</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0932"></a>

<p>The number of unaccompanied third-country minors without papers in the European Union is rising steadily.

<p>Is the Commission aware of this problem? Does it intend to take steps to address the situation of these minors properly and/or return them to their families?

<p>The Union commitment to the protection of children has been recently solemnly reaffirmed by the proclamation of the Charter of fundamental rights in December 2000 in Nice. Article 24 of the Charter, which is based upon the United nations Convention, confirms such fundamental principles as the right of children to protection and care necessary for their well-being, the possibility for them to express their views freely and their right to maintain regular relations with their parents. This provision also sets the criteria of the best interest of the child as a standard for public as well private institutions. Even if the Charter is not a legally binding instrument. The Commission, on March 2001 issued a Communication on “the application of the Charter of the fundamental Rights of the European Union". This Communication aims to draw the concrete consequences of the proclamation of the Charter in the daily action of the Commission, as well in its relations with the citizens and the recipients of its decisions, as in its rules and internal procedures. Accordingly any proposal of legislative or regulatory act to be adopted by the Commission should be subject to an a priori control of compatibility with the Charter.</p>
<p>The Scoreboard on progress made in implementing the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (March 2000) foresees that special attention will be made to the situation of children when drawing up instruments establishing the Common European Asylum System. The Commission has taken this point into account in all its legislative initiatives.</p>
<p>The Council has so far approved, in the field of asylum, two main initiatives which are relevant for unaccompanied minors: a Decision establishing a ‘European Refugee Fund’ (ERF) (2000/596/EC) and a Directive concerning the giving of temporary protection in the event of the mass influx of displaced persons (2001/55/EC).</p>
<p>The ERF has been established to support the efforts made by the Member States in receiving refugees and displaced persons. It supports, among others, measures for the reception of vulnerable persons such as unaccompanied minors.</p>
<p>The Directive on Temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons, has a specific provision concerning the full protection of unaccompanied minors under the temporary protection regime (Article 16).</p>
<p>All other proposals for Directives in the field of asylum still under discussion in front of the Council pay special attention to the situation of unaccompanied minors (on asylum procedures - COM/200/578 - on the reception of applicants for asylum - COM/2001/181- and on the qualification as refugee or a persons who needs otherwise international protection - COM/2001/510). Also the proposal for a regulation that will have to replace the Dublin Convention, concerning the States responsible for examining an application for asylum (COM/2001/447) lays down specific rules to avoid that an unaccompanied minor is left without protection.</p>
<p>In the migration field, special attention is also dedicated to children. In the Commission proposal for a Directive on the right to family reunification (COM/2000/624), the best interest of the child has to be taken into consideration in several steps of the procedure, with a reference to the UN Convention on the right of the child. Unaccompanied minors who are refugees have the right to reunite their parents or other relatives if the parents cannot be traced.</p>
<p>The Union has been paying attention to the issue of the unaccompanied minors also before the entering into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p>The Council had also adopted on the basis of Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty a Resolution, on 26 June 1997, on unaccompanied minors who are nationals of third countries. It is included in the Community acquis and contains provisions on minimum guarantees for all migrant unaccompanied minors, for unaccompanied minors during the asylum procedure and for returns.</p>
<p>Since 1997 the Commission has, through its programmes for asylum-seekers and refugees, (Budget Lines B5-8030 and B7-6008) co-financed projects specifically targeted at unaccompanied minors (once they had entered the asylum process).</p>
<p>The Odysseus program (migration, asylum, external frontiers EU co-operation program) has funded the «separated children in Europe program», a joint effort between Save the children and the United Nations High Committee for Refugees (UNHCR), which issued in 1999 a report and a statement of good practice.</p>
<p>Finally the Commission also supported and supports non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and organisations fighting against violence against children. In its four years of existence the DAPHNE program allowed for the implementation of around 100 projects dealing with the prevention of violence and the protection of children from violence. This program has now been given a pluri-annual basis for 2000-2003 and a further budget of EUR 20 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0939"></a>

<p>The honourable Member has drawn the Commission’s attention to a patent on a test for the early diagnosis of breast cancer in women granted by the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, according to legislation in force in the Member States of the Community, research is unrestricted as long as results are not used for commercial purposes. Granting a patent on the prevention of breast cancer will not therefore block research in this area. Directive 98/44 concerning the legal protection of biotechnological inventions<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has not departed from this principle. Similarly, the proposed regulation on the Community patent<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> also clearly upholds the concept of freedom of research.</p>
<p>However, if research results are marketed and if those results involve a previously patented technique, a licence must be obtained from the patent holder. If the patent refuses to issue a licence on reasonable terms, a compulsory licence may be issued for a fair fee. The arrangement currently in force within the European Community complies fully with the provisions within the framework of the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. (TRIPS)</p>
<p>The Community Legislator did not consider it necessary to draw up specific provisions regarding compulsory licensing of biotechnological inventions. The general arrangements now in force therefore also apply to this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are indeed currently no EU legal instruments in place that provide for a trans-border enforcement of fines such as the ones mentioned in the honourable Member’s Oral Question. In its July 2000 Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on “Mutual Recognition of Final Decisions in Criminal Matters”, the Commission has included a chapter on “pecuniary penalties”, in which the Commission argues for full trans-border recognition and enforcement of fines, in line with the general considerations for “enforcing decisions” in the chapter with that latter title.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden have taken an initiative under Article 34 paragraph 2 litera b of the EU Treaty for a Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties.1 The Commission strongly supports this initiative, as it would introduce an EU-wide, efficient system for enforcing fines. It is particularly important that the text adopted will cover all kinds of fines, notably also those imposed by administrative authorities, and small sums. If either of these were excluded from trans-border enforcement via the quick and simple mutual recognition mechanisms, their effects would be very limited. Regrettably, negotiations in Council show that some delegations still find it difficult to accept mutual recognition of these types of financial penalties.</p>
<p>The Council has already consulted the European Parliament on the draft of this Framework Decision. The Commission understands that the honourable Member Mrs Cerdeira Morterero has been appointed rapporteur for the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and that that Committee has approved her draft report on 4December 2001. It is to be submitted to the European Parliament’s plenary at its January 2002 session. The Commission is very much looking forward to the Parliament’s opinion on the draft and will itself do everything it can to ensure that all kinds of fines will be effectively enforceable throughout the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0943"></a>

<p>According to a study by Carles Ibáñez Martí, the Ebro delta is one of the areas worst affected by the build-up of river sediment. The study estimates that the reservoirs in the river catchment area, which number almost 200, are the cause of the build-up of more than 99% of the sediment once carried down the river (Guillén y Palanques 1992, Ibáñez et al. 1996). As a result the coastline around the estuary is changing shape, whilst subsidence and a rising sea level are resulting in a decline in the elevation of the delta plain as a whole. A continuation of this trend over the medium to long term would cause the coastline to recede markedly and a wider area of the delta to fall below sea level. Although this process began decades ago with the construction of reservoirs, falling water levels and additional reservoirs could exacerbate the situation and make it even more difficult to find sustainable solutions.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan. The Commission is also aware that a central part of the plan involves transfers of significant amounts of water from the river Ebro to other regions of Spain. To effect these transfers will necessitate the construction of dams both in the Ebro basin and elsewhere. The Commission is also aware of the unique value of the Ebro delta in terms of habitat and bio-diversity: the delta is recognised as a special area under the RAMSAR convention. The Commission is concerned that, in accordance with EU legislation, the Ebro delta is protected and conserved, both for its intrinsic value, and the enjoyment of future generations.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to pursue a dialogue with the Spanish authorities concerning the relationship between the hydrological plan and relevant pieces of Community legislation. In particular the Commission has drawn the attention of the Spanish authorities to the Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992, on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora; the Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979, on the conservation of wild birds; the Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000, establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy; and the Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985, on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
