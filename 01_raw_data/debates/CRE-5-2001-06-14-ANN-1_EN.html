<p>Following the BSE crisis and consequently, because of the ban on animal protein products for the use in animal feedingstuffs, the Council, on the basis of an analysis and a proposal by the Commission has, as a first step, adopted a regulation amending the support system for producers of certain arable crops. This regulation, which in itself does not pretend to fill the gap as far as the need of replacement of animal proteins by vegetable proteins is concerned, provides the possibility for organic farmers to produce certain protein rich crops on set-aside land.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has presented to the Council and the European Parliament a Communication and a Working Paper with options to promote the cultivation of plant proteins within the European Union.

<p>First of all, let me say that I share the Honourable Member's concern for the tourism industry in the various parts of the Community suffering considerable adverse effects as a consequence of the foot-and-mouth crisis. Support measures have been targeted solely at the agricultural sector. Non-agricultural sectors, such as tourism, are not therefore covered by these measures.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed the question of mandating the Commission to look into the matter. Compensating the tourism industry for the consequences of foot-and-mouth disease must first and foremost be a matter for the individual Member States. In addition, account should of course be taken of the fact that support for individual businesses contravenes EC rules on State aid, with the exception of aid approved by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0499"></a>

<p>According to the ‘road map’ covering the period of 1 January 2001 to 1 July 2002, the EU should, in the course of the Belgian Presidency during the second half of 2001, establish its position on this chapter in order, on a preliminary basis, to conclude the chapter with those applicant countries which have achieved the most. </p>

<p>According to the German newspaper ‘Die Tageszeitung’, the CIA, the French and German intelligence services and NATO had been aware since 17 June 1995 that General Perisic was in charge of coordination from Belgrade of the preparations for the attack on the Srebrenica enclave which fell into the hands of the Serb forces on 11 July 1995. It is also claimed that NATO Member States’ intelligence services have compiled evidence on film of mass executions carried out by Serb forces after they had taken Srebrenica. Furthermore, several sources claim that, at a meeting of the Security Council, General Janvier, Commander of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, said that missions which endangered UNPROFOR troops, such as those in the enclaves in eastern Bosnia, should be abandoned. It is also claimed that, on five separate occasions, he refused to authorise the air strikes requested by the Dutch Unit because, inter alia, he wanted to get rid of that enclave. </p>
<p>Can the Council get right to the bottom of the role played by the Member States of the Union in this affair? Can it also provide total confirmation that the evidence held by the Member States has actually been forwarded to the ICC?

<p>A 'secret' pact was recently signed in Prizren in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between the ethnic Albanian political leaders and the head of the Albanian independence movement with the mediation of the US envoy to the OSCE, R. Fruik. It appears that the EU and its High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Javier Solana, are seeking to decline all responsibility for this development and are clearly working on 'new' initiatives and 'new' agreements without however taking the obvious step of calling on the leaders of the Albanian parties to withdraw from the above agreement. Instead, according to reliable sources, Mr Solana is involved in the drawing up of a new agreement which will effectively mean that the demands of the Albanian autonomists will once more be submitted in modified form for negotiation within the controversial political dialogue. This has clearly given further encouragement to the leaders of the Albanian parties who openly regard themselves as the political leaders of the Albanian autonomist movement.</p>

<p>The ‘Prizren document’ mentioned in the question by the honourable Member and signed by elected Albanian leaders and Albanian extremist groups was the result of contacts between the OSCE’s envoy to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Ambassador Frowick, and Albanian extremist leaders. Ambassador Frowick’s initiative was not coordinated with the EU and NATO. </p>
<p>As the honourable Member is surely aware, the ‘Prizren document’ has undermined the recently formed government of national unity which includes both Slavic and Albanian democratically elected leaders. </p>
<p>As a result of this worrying development, Secretary-General/High Representative Solana visited Skopje again on 28 May and, following difficult and very sensitive discussions, convinced the leaders of the largest parties represented in Parliament to agree upon a common statement in which they undertake to continue to work together in the government of national unity, to speed up the legislative work on those measures agreed upon and to achieve significant progress with President Trajkovski’s programme for solving problems between the ethnic groups. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the situation on the ground is still very tense as a result of armed conflicts and ethnically motivated incidents that have recently occurred in Bitola. Mr Solana visited FYROM again on 8 and 9 June, which resulted in an agreement within the governing coalition to increase efforts to achieve rapid results concerning reforms that have been needed for a long time, particularly when it comes to the rights of minorities, an area that is important for long-term stability in the country. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0513"></a>

<p>The Council deeply regrets that the hunger strikes in Turkey are still leading to loss of life and urges all those directly involved to act in such a way that this humanitarian tragedy is stopped. The Council and the Member States have raised the matter with the Turkish Government and will continue to do so in the context of the enhanced political dialogue, the next occasion being the meeting of the EC-Turkey Association Council on 26 June.

Changes in the law have come into force or will shortly do so, including some aiming to reduce the isolation of prisoners. The Council urges the Turkish Government to implement the new laws speedily and in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. Taking this into consideration, the Council hopes that the hunger strikers and their families will, for their parts, reconsider their actions.</p>

<p>As the Honourable Member will recall, his written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2001-1207_EN.html">P-1207/01</a> was identical to this oral question and was replied to on 5<span class="sup">th</span> June:</p>
<p>The Commission’s response naturally remains the same. To save the time of the House I will not go through the lengthy reply in detail.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows the Commission attaches great importance to the social consequences of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Since the relevant European Directives on labour law and industrial relations have been transposed into national law, the decisions about whether infringements have taken place clearly rest with national administrative or judicial authorities.</p>
<p>Against that background, the Commission has repeatedly emphasised its view that corporate restructuring should be undertaken with a sense of responsibility to employees and has consequently underlined the need for employees' information and consultation rights to be strengthened.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will share the pleasure of the Commission at the decision of the Council yesterday to adopt legislation which requires that employees in companies of at least 50 workers will have basic rights to be provided with information about recent and forthcoming developments in company activity, and about the company's economic and financial situation; basic rights of information and consultation on employment issues and on decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation; and basic rights of information about the way in which a company proposes to handle those changes.</p>
<p>Next month, the Commission intends to present a Green Paper on corporate social responsibility emphasising the need for the interests and concerns of all stakeholders who are affected by changes and decisions to receive balanced consideration.</p>
<p>In addition, in its Social Policy Agenda, the Commission proposed the creation of an observatory on change which is being developed by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The Honourable Member will be familiar with the details of this activity.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member recognises in his question, corporate restructuring is part of commercial evolution and can contribute to increased competitiveness, economic growth, expanded employment and the capacity to manage change successfully.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Official Journal of the European Communities of 11 April 2001, ref. C 110A, published a notice of open competition COM/A/6/01 to constitute a reserve of administrators in the fields of external relations (reserve of 80 people) and management aid to non-member countries (reserve of 170 people). The conditions for eligibility (Paragraph III (B) (1)) impose an age limit: ‘You must have been born after 25 May 1955’. This condition is not consistent with Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which expressly opposes this form of discrimination. The European Institutions should be the first to observe the rules they impose on the Member States, not only to set an example, but also for the sake of their own credibility.</p>
<p>Why has the Commission ignored this directive? What does it plan to do in this regard in future in its own area of competence? In view of the conflict with Directive 2000/78/EC, will candidates who were born before 25 May 1955 be able nonetheless to put in a valid application for this competition?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member would expect, the Commission is fully aware of the provisions of Council Directive 2000/78/CE of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>.</p>
<p>The legislation was not, of course, imposed on Member States as inferred by the Honourable Member’s question. Like all other Community legislation it was enacted by the Member States in Council and by this House.</p>
<p>According to Article 18 of the Directive, Member States have until 2 December 2003 to adopt the legal and administrative measures necessary for its implementation. If necessary, they may even have an additional period of 3 years from 2 December 2003 to implement the provisions of this Directive relating to age and disability discrimination.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member will have noted, the Directive aims to establish a general principle of prohibition of any direct or indirect discrimination based, inter alia, on age. In Article 6, however, it also provides for a number of situations in which the use of age limits could legally be justified. For instance, the Directive identifies the fixing of a maximum age for recruitment which is based on the training requirements of the post in question, and it also allows for a reasonable period of employment before retirement.</p>
<p>The Directive has no direct effect on Community Law and on Staff Regulations. Despite that, in January 1998 the Commission agreed to the principle of abandoning age limits on recruitment and also expressed the view that a co-ordinated approach amongst all the European Institutions was needed. In addition the Commission adopted the interim policy of introducing a higher age limit of 45 years, instead of 35 years, for competitions for recruitment at basic grades.</p>
<p>As the House will know, the Commission is in the process of reforming its administrative practices and has specifically reaffirmed its commitment to abandoning age limits for open competitions. This measure is due to come into force after the current consultations and negotiations with staff representatives are completed and the Commission has adopted a finalised policy.</p>
<p>As that change comes nearer, the Commission hopes that similar arrangements will be adopted and employed by all of the Institutions. It is sure that many Members of this House will share that hope.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has actually opened infringement procedures against three Member States in respect of failure to comply with obligations under Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC.</p>
<p>The Member States concerned are Greece – Letter of formal notice dispatched on 9/11/1999; Belgium – Letter of formal notice dispatched on 6/3/2000 and Spain – Letter of formal notice dispatched on 22/1/1999.</p>
<p>All these Member States replied to the Commission’s letter of formal notice. In each case the replies indicated that legislative or administrative action had been taken in order to correct the deficiencies of implementation alleged by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, the Commission's experience of enforcement of animal welfare legislation shows that it is necessary to look not only at the legislative and administrative situation existing in the Member States but also at the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>For this reason animal welfare infringement files are normally kept open even when a Member State asserts that the deficiencies alleged have been corrected until the situation on the ground can be verified by a further inspection mission of the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO).</p>
<p>In the case of Belgium and Greece, FVO missions in the year 2000 indicated a still unsatisfactory situation in relation to enforcement of the respect of certain aspects of the Directive. Furthermore, as regards Belgium complaints by an animal welfare organisation, which appear to be well-founded, of serious breaches of the Directive in relation to animals transported to livestock markets were received at the end of 2000 and early in 2001. The Commission is in consequence preparing supplementary action to take account of these recent developments.</p>
<p>In respect of Spain, the Commission has decided to dispatch a reasoned opinion to that Member State.</p>
<p>Appropriate action in relation to several other Member States in relation to the Directive is currently also being considered.</p>
<p>In relation to the Honourable Member’s request for copies of correspondence passing between the Commission and Member States relating to these infringements of animal welfare legislation the Commission cannot supply such copies on the basis that in order that the Article 226 of the EC Treaty procedure should function in accordance with the intentions of the authors of the Treaty, confidentiality is required particularly concerning written communications passing between the parties during the early administrative or pre-judicial stage of the procedure.

<p>As the Honourable Member is aware, the Commission has for some time been in discussion with the Scottish authorities about bringing the services currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne into conformity with Community law, in particular Council Regulation 3577/92 of 7 December 1992<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> on the freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States and the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport<a href="#defann_17_4" name="refann_17_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 2</span>.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the strong preference of the Scottish Executive is to tender the network as a whole, with the creation of a publicly-owned vessel owning company leasing the vessels to the successful bidder on a commercial basis. It is also proposed that the vessel-owning company would act as “an operator of last resort”<a href="#defann_17_5" name="refann_17_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span>, which would appear designed to address precisely the concern of the Honourable Member that an emergency backup service be available for the lifeline routes in the event that the selected operator should fail.</p>
<p>Since Article 295 of the Treaty establishes both the principle of impartiality with regard to the system of property ownership and the principle of equality between public and private undertakings, secondary legislation such as Council Regulation 3577/92 cannot enforce the privatisation of the existing public ferry operation. The objectives of the Commission are to uphold the principle of non-discrimination between Community shipowners as well as ensuring that any state aid required is proportionate to the objective of providing the necessary level of public service. These objectives will remain the guiding principles underlying the revision of the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport currently foreseen for next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees that vessels targeting Norway lobsters (langoustines) take hake as an unavoidable by-catch since these species inhabit the same geographical areas.</p>
<p>It will be prohibited to fish in a part of the areas in which these species coexist unless trawls of mesh size at least 100mm are used. This will partially protect the smaller hake but will make it much more difficult to retain the Norway lobsters.</p>
<p>In principle, and on purely biological grounds, it would be preferable to define the area in which 100mm should be used as the whole of the area co-inhabited by hake and Norway lobsters.</p>
<p>However, if this is done, there will be considerable loss of fishing opportunities based on Norway lobster for at least two Member States (France, Ireland). Therefore, a part of the area co-inhabited has not been closed.</p>
<p>Observers will be on board vessels, including those fishing for Norway lobster, operating within the areas which might otherwise have been closed. The results of their observations will be used by the Commission in reconsidering the extent of the controlled area in future.</p>
<p>Apart from the controlled area, the requirement for all trawls to be made of thinner twine and the installation of large-meshed panels into beam trawlers should improve selectivity of fishing gears for hake and will thereby reduce the quantities of small hake caught.</p>
<p>At present, scientific knowledge on how to further improve selectivity for hake is somewhat deficient.</p>
<p>For the future, the Commission is aware of selectivity trials currently taking place in France. In addition, the Commission will encourage and is prepared to fund further experimentation on this topic. To that end, the Commission will establish a group of scientists to define the appropriate programme of work. The results of the experimentation will enable the Commission to put forward additional conditions to improve selectivity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0443"></a>

<p>In reply to the oral question raised by the honourable Member, it can be recalled that the Commission launched its work in this field in December 1997, by adopting a Communication entitled “Implementing European Union Strategy in the field of Defence-related Industries”.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking document presented a comprehensive 14 points Action Plan, containing a list of areas in which it considers Union action necessary and has specified what measures should be taken to ensure progress towards a true European market for defence products. At the same time, the Council was encouraged to adopt a common position on the framing of a European defence industry.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, there has not been as much progress as initially expected in implementing this strategy. The discussions in Council have been characterised by divergencies of opinion between the Member States. However, the analysis that was provided, advocating a need for restructuring the European defence industry and for creating a single market for defence products, is still valid. The transformation of the industrial landscape is spectacular, particularly in the aerospace and electronics sectors. Good progress is also noticeable in the land armament and naval sectors.</p>
<p>The defence related industry cannot remain competitive on the global stage unless allowed to fully benefit from a consolidation on the supply side and a set up of an associated Internal market. The Commission is responsible for ensuring that the Internal market operates, but it is equally important that also the Member States contribute to the process.</p>
<p>Some initiatives of an intergovernmental character have been developed:</p>
<p>A Letter of Intent was signed mid-1998 to improve co-ordination among six Member States in order to facilitate the industrial restructuring and further the functioning of the transnational companies:</p>
<p>The OCCAR (Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement) Treaty brings the legal personality to that Joint Organisation for Armaments Co-operation involving four Member States.</p>
<p>With regard to the single market, progress has been achieved in the field of defence standardisation: the Commission funded a study on standardisation systems used in the defence industries in the United States and in the Union. Concluded in 1999, it delivered a set of recommendations for action leading to the possibility of formulating specifications in a common manner, thus, facilitating common-procurement policies. These recommendations are currently in development, in particular, the standardisation bodies and others stakeholders. The Commission should continue to contribute to the creation of the European defence-equipment market.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Commission’s Action Plan, the Commission examines this issue, in particular, with reference to the completion of the internal market in the above-mentioned domain. However, legislative proposals are not on this year’s Commission work programme.</p>
<p>As far as the second part of the oral question by the honourable Member is concerned, the Court of Justice, in cases C-70/94 and C-83/94, stated that dual-use goods fall within the scope of the Common Commercial Policy defined by Article 113 (now renumbered 133) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>In 1998, in accordance with these Court of Justice rulings, the Commission issued a regulation revising the existing common regime for dual-use exports controls, with Article 133 as the legal base. The Council adopted that regulation in 2000. At the same time, this constituted the completion of the Action “9a” of the 1997 Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0449"></a>

<p>The Commission has been most concerned by the numerous reports of breaches in the rules governing specified risk material (SRM) with regard to imports of beef into the United Kingdom. Removal of SRMs remains the most important measure for public health protection. Of the thirteen incidents that have come to its attention since 1 January, seven have involved German exports. In an exchange of letters with Minister Kunast during February and March, the Commission called for swift action against the offending export plants and received assurances that SRM controls had been tightened to prevent further infringements. The Commission has again been in contact with the German Chief Veterinary Officer about the latest incident discovered on 30 March.</p>
<p>But the issue is more global. During the April Agricultural Council the Commission re-emphasised to all Member States the importance of efficient SRM removal in the protection of Public Health. It referred to the latest Food and veterinary office (FVO) missions on the SRM controls of which preliminary reports indicate that shortcomings prevail. It should however be taken into consideration that the very reason for the Commission to ban vertebral column was the possibility for its contamination with dorsal root ganglia and remnants of spinal cord. Therefore, conclusions on the risk for human health can not be drawn solely from the outcome of import controls, it should also be assessed whether the vertebral column is properly removed at the points of sale. It is of crucial importance to receive the complete picture from the FVO mission reports. As soon as this is available the Commission will consider what action to take. But it can assure the Honourable Member that it will not take this issue lightly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0450"></a>

The production of a Euro 5 coin was envisaged, and then ruled out when the decision was taken to produce a note of the same amount.

In this letter he states that private individuals will be able to buy series of coins from the middle of December in all the countries involved, with the exception of Greece. Moreover, the Commission information leaflet entitled 'INFEURO' (No.18/Gr-2001-2) contains a summary table which shows that in Greece the maximum amount of drachmas that can be changed into euros will vary between Drs. 30 000 and 600 000 per customer, while in Austria, for example, the ceiling is double this, while in Spain there is no limit, and much the same arrangements obtain in Italy. As for the changing of banknotes and coins, Greece has set a time limit of ten and two years, respectively, while in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria there is either no time limit, or it is markedly longer than in Greece. Will the Commission say why Greece has not been provided with an advance supply of euro coins, why the ceiling for changing drachmas into euros is so low, why the period of time for changing banknotes and coins currently in circulation into euros is shorter in Greece than in most of the other countries of the eurozone?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Article 21 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights states that any discrimination based on, inter alia, sexual orientation shall be prohibited in the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission, in the person of Romano Prodi, has undertaken to work for the practical implementation of the Charter in the Member States, proclaiming that citizens 'may count on the Commission to ensure that it is respected'. Nevertheless, and despite the European Parliament's repeated reminders of the importance of respecting fundamental rights linked to equality, the criminal law in Austria sets a higher age of consent for homosexual than for heterosexual relations.</p>
<p>There is also discrimination within the EU against homosexual couples wishing to exercise their right to freedom of movement without losing social security benefits when moving between Member States, as laid down in Regulation (EEC) 1408/71<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and implementing Regulation (EEC) 574/72<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which give considerable protection to members of an individual's family, who are also entitled to accompany the head of the family when moving within the EU. The definition of family members is however a matter for national legislation, which means that couples who have made partnership ties in one Member State are not automatically regarded as lawfully wedded in another.</p>

<p>The honourable Member raises two issues relating to discrimination against homosexuals in the Community. First of all, she refers to the fact that, according to Austrian criminal law, the age of consent is higher for homosexual relationships than it is for heterosexual relationships.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to confirm its commitment to ensuring that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected. However, we would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Article 51 of that text which indicates that the provisions of the Charter are applied to the institutions and bodies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.</p>
<p>Austrian criminal law in this field does not come within the scope of Community law. The Commission cannot, therefore, take a position on this problem, which involves Austria’s internal legislation. For the same reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 21 thereof, is not applicable here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this issue can be submitted to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg when every other internal avenue of recourse has been exhausted.</p>
<p>The issue of non-discrimination is one to which the Union attaches considerable importance.</p>
<p>On November 1999, the Commission adopted a package of proposals to combat discrimination in the Community based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> establishes a general principle of prohibition of any direct or indirect discrimination based, inter alia, on sexual orientation. Accordingly to Article 18 of the Directive, Member States have until 2 December 2003 to take the necessary measures at national level to implement the directive. (with a possibility of an additional period of 3 years where necessary to implement the provisions on disability and age discrimination).</p>
<p>Council Decision of 27 November 2000 establishing a Community Action Programme to combat discrimination (2001-2006) (2000/750/EC)<a href="#defann_24_4" name="refann_24_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span> puts in practice a strategy for combating all forms of discrimination on different grounds, including sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Together, these measures will constitute a comprehensive basis for action to fight against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, providing a minimum level of legal rights, supported by practical action to promote the effective application of those rights on the ground.</p>
<p>As the Court of Justice has underlined on many occasions, Regulation 1408/71 and 574/72 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, self-employed persons and members of their family moving within the Community<a href="#defann_24_5" name="refann_24_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span> do not aim to harmonise but only co-ordinate national social security systems. The definition of family members is therefore a matter for national legislation on which the benefits are provided.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Firstly, the Commission refers the honourable Member and the letter sent to him by the Commissioner Nielson in charge of Development on 16 May 2001, which included copy of the response of Commission services to Brother Eddie McArdle’s statement regarding the relationship between CAMSAT and the EU Project AMAR (*).</p>
<p>Secondly, it should be emphasised that the AMAR project is open to work and in collaboration with governmental and non-governmental organisations. In fact, a total of 30 activities during Phase I were carried out through partnerships with both government and NGOs. It is important to realise that AMAR is not entitled to select projects for funding. AMAR is in charge of designing and formulating the activities to be carried out, within the framework of participative community plans.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in addition to these explanations, and regarding the honourable Member’s specific concern about project expenditures in diagnostic studies, infrastructure and equipment, the Commission would point out that :</p>
<p>The Financing Agreement sets an initial planning phase with an 18-month duration. During this phase, which was finalised in the last quarter of the year 2000, a great number of activities (most of them related to diagnosis, research and designs, plus two pilot projects) were carried out for the detailed design of the project. CAMSAT has participated in workshops and has provided input to AMAR in its research in Bañado Tacumbú.</p>
<p>The infrastructure and equipment planned for phase II relate to improvement of existing infrastructure (schools, community centres) and not the construction of new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Lastly, the non governmental organisation (NGO) Network for the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CDIA), integrated by 15 NGOs, of which CAMSAT is a member, requested a meeting with AMAR on February 2001, with the purpose that AMAR explain the project. On 27 February CDIA submitted a letter to AMAR thanking the project for the meeting and expressing the support of the member organisations to the project and their willingness to collaborate in the implementation of AMAR´s proposals.</p>

<p>The second report on cohesion, adopted on 31 January 2001 by the Commission, provides an answer to the question put by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>The decisions taken at the Berlin European Council in March 1999 remain valid for the 2000-2006 programming period. The amounts granted for structural aid to eligible regions of the current Member States were determined within the framework of those financial perspectives. The amounts granted for structural actions for the benefit of the new Member States, between their accession dates and 2006, also appear in the conclusions of the Berlin European Council. They were determined on the basis of hypothetical accession dates as well as the number of candidate countries accepted at the time of the European Council.</p>
<p>The second report on cohesion presents a very detailed analysis of the imperatives of the cohesion policy after enlargement. The Commission has already opened a broad debate on the content and objectives of the cohesion policy for the period following 2006, particularly at the Cohesion Forum which took place at the Parliament in Brussels on 21-22 May 2001.

<p>Spent fuel from Medsamor was sent to the Soviet Union for reprocessing in the past, without the obligation of the generated waste being returned. This practice was interrupted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The spent fuel has been accumulating in the spent fuel ponds of Medsamor since then. In 1996, Framatome signed an agreement with Armenia to supply dry spent fuel containers to store 612 fuel assemblies. The construction of this dry spent fuel facility, which is designed to be used for 50 years, has recently been completed and licensed. It could be extended if and when required. Out of the 847 fuel assemblies that were stored in the ponds, 336 have already been transferred to the facility. Operational radioactive waste are presently stored in the plant.</p>
<p>As regards an energy strategy, work has been developed jointly with the Armenian authorities to evaluate the potential for replacement energies. This strategy has been discussed with all major donors and Financing Institutions (World Bank, EBRD, US Aid, etc). One of the conclusions is that hydraulic power has the greatest potential as an alternative source of energy.</p>

<p>When Parliament considered the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties on 17 May, Commissioner Schreyer let it be known that the Commission had given careful consideration to the legal basis for the proposal, and in particular to the proposal's compatibility with Article 308.</p>

<p>The Commission in fact examined the appropriate legal basis for its proposal when it was drawn up and adopted. It concluded that Article 308 of the EC Treaty was a good basis.</p>
<p>In its established case law, the Court of Justice said that Article 308 of the Treaty is a subsidiary legal basis which can only serve as a legal basis for an act if no other provision of the Treaty grants the institutions the necessary competence to lay down that act (see, for example, Judgment of 6 July 1982, Cases 188 to 190/80, France, Italy and the United Kingdom v Commission, ECR 2545, paragraphs 9 and 10 of the grounds).</p>
<p>It should be noted that no provision of the EC Treaty currently in force expressly grants the institutions the competence to lay down an act providing for the funding of European political parties from the Community budget. In fact, Article 191 of the Treaty (before any amendment resulting from the Treaty of Nice) contains no provision of an operational nature allowing for the adoption of a measure such as the one proposed.</p>
<p>However, Article 191 of the Treaty defines the European political parties as a means of integration within the Union. Since this is an article of the Treaty and not a simple political declaration, it should be interpreted as having not only a political scope and expressing a principle, but also a legal scope. In particular, the other Treaty provisions may be interpreted in the light of the principle it expresses.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the Court of Justice said in its Opinion 2/94 of 28 March 1996 (ECR p. I-1759, paragraph 29), that Article 308 ‘is designed to fill the gap where no specific provisions of the Treaty confer on the Community institutions express or implied powers to act, if such powers appear none the less to be necessary to enable the Community to carry out its functions with a view to attaining one of the objectives laid down by the Treaty’. There is no doubt that Article 191, even in its current form, expresses the political need introduced by the contracting parties to the Treaty of Maastricht into the body of European Union Treaties as a whole.</p>
<p>Since this is the case, the Commission considered that Article 308 of the Treaty could serve as the legal basis for a measure which is intended to provide practical expression for an important means of European integration, which is now one of the general objectives of the Treaty.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission does not have any documents which can be communicated to the honourable Member, bearing in mind that the debates on this issue took place orally within the Commission and that the position it adopted in law is under no doubt.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0464"></a>

<p>Negotiations on the taxation chapter started in November 1999 with six candidate countries. During the first semester 2001 the chapter has been or will be opened with four additional candidate countries. Negotiations, aimed at discussing the terms under which candidate countries will adopt and implement the Community legislation in force on taxation, have been progressing, however the chapter has not as yet been provisionally closed with any of the concerned candidate country.</p>
<p>The Community VAT legislation, the Sixth VAT Directive of 17 May 1977, (77/388/EEC, OJ L 145, 13.6.1977 as amended) provides for the application of the standard VAT rate on the supply of childcare products.</p>
<p>As a general rule, candidate countries are expected to fully align to Community acquis by the time of accession. However, in the framework of negotiations, they are entitled to request transitional arrangements in order to postpone full compliance with certain aspects of the acquis to a later date. The Community general negotiation position is that transitional measures have to be exceptional, limited in time and scope and accompanied by a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the acquis. Furthermore, they must not involve amendments to the rules or policies of the Community, disrupt their proper functioning, or lead to significant distortions of competition within the Internal Market.</p>
<p>One candidate country has requested a transitional period concerning childcare necessities (children’s clothing and footwear). This request is currently being assessed by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0465"></a>

<p>The Commission cannot share the opinion of the honourable Member on the alleged restrictions on the import of camel-milk products from Mauritania due to a lack of regulations concerning this type of product. Community veterinary legislation applies to all animal products irrespective of their origin, ensuring the same high level of consumer and animal health protection.</p>
<p>The Commission pays careful attention to the import from third countries of live animals and products of animal origin, because they could constitute a hazard, in particular, for human and animal health in the Community. In this context, there is a permanent updating and revision of the Community lists of third countries authorised to export milk and milk-based products to the Community. Mauritania does not, at present, appear on these lists, which are drawn up on the basis of information provided by the [“Office International des Epizooties” (O.I.E.) World Organisation for Animal Health] and by the national competent authorities of the exporting country.</p>
<p>The Commission has been in contact, for many years, with Mrs Abeiderrahmane providing her with assistance and advice in the follow-up of this file. However, the Commission never received an application, including the necessary official public and animal health guarantees, from the competent authorities of Mauritania. These guarantees concern the performance of the competent authorities, the control structures, inspection systems and frequency of checks. The sanitary status of the country as regards foot-and-mouth disease must be assessed in order to define what kind of products may be imported and under which conditions. Only milk products which have undergone a double pasteurisation, or an acidification resulting in an equivalent level of destruction of foot-and-mouth disease virus can be accepted from a country that is not free from foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<p>In 1996, a first step was achieved when the possibility for importation of milk and milk-based products from species other than cattle, sheep, goats and buffaloes was introduced into Community legislation (see Commission Decision 96/90/EC). Since then, the Commission has continued to follow up the file, requesting scientific and technical advice on the matter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the characteristics of camel's milk are not completely covered by the scientific and technical knowledge, on which Community legislation as regards the import of milk products was constructed. The question of the ability of camels to transmit foot-and-mouth disease to other species has not yet received a clear scientific answer.</p>
<p>Moreover, the phosphatase test, which is the international reference test to check that pasteurisation of milk is achieved, cannot be satisfactorily interpreted when applied to camel milk. The Commission is trying to solve this major problem, with the technical assistance of the Community Reference Laboratory for milk and milk-products. The Commission is aware of the potential economic impact of these rules on third countries, in particular for less developed countries. The Community is, however, not in a position to allow the lowering of its level of protection. The recent foot-and-mouth disease crisis in Europe has shown that a cautious approach is necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0471"></a>

<p>The aim of Tacis has been, since 1991, to support the transition process towards market economy and democracy in the New Independent States (former Soviet Union minus the Baltic States).</p>
<p>Increasingly it is an instrument supporting the political and economic partnership between the Union and the Partner States. It provides know-how to improve trade and investment climate, promotes civil society and tackles issues of mutual interest (environment, nuclear safety, health).</p>
<p>The External Relations Directorate General is responsible for Tacis programming: definition of objectives, areas of co-operation and strategies, on the basis of Union’s and Partner States’ priorities.

With this in mind, unification of the project cycle management under EuropeAid and simplification of procedures will ensure that the identification and quick implementation of projects is more closely linked to local needs. De-concentration of responsibilities to the Delegation will further enable a quick adaptation of the projects to local conditions.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the competent authorities of each Member State to identify waters that fall under the Bathing Water Directive. The Bathing Water Directive concerns “all running or still fresh waters or parts thereof and sea water in which bathing is explicitly authorised by the competent authorities of each Member State or bathing is not prohibited and is traditionally practised by a large number of bathers”.</p>
<p>This means that not all Swedish lakes, rivers and coastal beaches are/have to be identified as bathing waters under the bathing water directive. The limiting factor will be “…where bathing is traditionally practised by a large number of bathers”. It is left to the competent authorities to assess what a large number of bathers are. To give you an example, 50 bathers are not a lot in Spain, but in Northern Sweden this would be certainly be considered as a large number. On the basis of the definition of the Directive, the Swedish government has identified 372 coastal and 401 fresh water bathing areas.</p>
<p>On average in the Community, one single laboratory analysis of a water sample costs about EUR 25. The number of samples under the current directive depends on the length of the bathing season. In Sweden, the officially declared bathing season is about two months, running from 20 June to 20 August. The Directive requires 1 sample to be taken every 14 days and one extra sample before the season, which means 5 samples have to be taken for an average Swedish bathing water, coming to a total analysis cost per year per bathing area of around EUR 125.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently working on a proposal for a revised directive and no decision has yet been taken on the exact definition of bathing waters for such as revised directive. It does not expect, however, that in a first instance the number of bathing areas would increase dramatically, but would rather remain in the same range, so for Sweden around 750 bathing areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0476"></a>

Such a substantial review is said to consist, inter alia, of introducing 'improved rules for the control of … other zoonoses than salmonellosis'.</p>
<p>Sweden still requires vaccination against distemper and the deworming of imported dogs and cats in an effort to combat dwarf tapeworm. The dwarf tapeworm is a particularly unpleasant zoonosis which, in the worst case scenario, can be transferred via foxes and rodents to berries and mushrooms in the woods and from there to humans, with death as the probable outcome. Every year, some 30 cases are identified in Europe, and an infected fox has recently been discovered in Denmark. At the same time, the Commission is rumoured to be considering depriving Sweden of the possibility of taking the above safety precautions, possibly in conjunction with the revision of the directive on zoonoses.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm that these rumours are correct? What changes are actually planned with regard to the Member States' control of zoonoses in general and of the dwarf tapeworm in particular?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question put to the Commission concerns the public health problem caused by a tape worm (Echinococcus multilocularis) whose adult form is carried by domestic or wild carnivores and whose larval form can lead to serious and sometimes fatal pathologies in humans. This zoonosis, while rare, has been observed throughout wide areas of the European continent.</p>
<p>However, it has never been discovered within the territory of certain countries such as Sweden, the United Kingdom or Ireland. The Commission is aware that, in order to prevent the introduction of this tape worm, the Swedish authorities require dogs and cats to be de-wormed before they are allowed into Swedish territory. The United Kingdom and Ireland have adopted equivalent provisions.</p>
<p>The Commission clearly does not intend to prohibit these Member States from maintaining this precautionary measure since this is a public health issue with serious consequences.</p>
<p>The rumour referred to here may not be connected to the draft amendment of Directive 92/117/EEC on zoonoses, but very possibly to the proposed European Parliament and Council regulation on the health regulations applicable to non-commercial movements of pets.</p>
<p>This proposed regulation was examined by Parliament at its plenary sitting of 2 May 2001. The point raised here was dealt with during parliamentary debates and it was explained at that time that the response to the concern that the current system implemented by the Swedish authorities and others would be brought into question was contained in Article 8 of the proposal. This Article 8, in effect, lays down that a Member State may obtain additional guarantees when a particular situation justifies it, which is undoubtedly so in the case of Echinococcus Multilocularis and the protection of the Member States which are not infested with this parasite. Having the recourse to the provisions of this article will therefore allow the Swedish authorities to maintain the obligation to de-worm carnivores before they enter Swedish territory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Green Paper identifies four main objectives for the future Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), among them the increasing involvement of stakeholders in the decision making process.</p>
<p>Indeed, in many instances fishermen have complained of their lack of involvement in the formulation of rules that affect their daily working lives.</p>
<p>The Commission suggests in the Green Paper to establish a network of regional advisory committees on fisheries as a way to strengthen involvement of all stakeholders in discussions about fisheries management at an early stage. However, this new procedure must be compatible with the Treaty and the Community character of the CFP.</p>
<p>The Green Paper also suggests decentralising certain management responsibilities in order to address local and emergency situations effectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the context of the emergency measures taken by the Commission and of the preparation of the recovery plans for cod in the Irish Sea, the North Sea and the West of Scotland as well as for Northern hake, which are to be put in place in the coming months, the Commission has associated closely representatives of the industry, of the Member States and scientists with the decision making process. It is its intention to continue associating the stakeholders concerned in this process.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the framework of the Action Plan to strengthen the dialogue with the industry and other groups interested in the CFP, adopted in mid-1999, the Commission is implementing a series of activities. Representatives of the European Fishing Sector and other groups are regularly consulted through the renewed Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture; informal discussions on matters of common interest are also being regularly held within regional workshops focussing on specific fisheries.</p>
<p>Information and communication activities, such as the publication of a bi-monthly magazine in all 11 languages and the distribution of information on paper but also on the multilingual web site, are also carried out by the Commission in order to ensure that the industry and other stakeholders are properly informed of new initiatives and developments concerning the CFP, so that they can take part effectively in the dialogue with the Community on this policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0480"></a>

<p>According to the project manager responsible, there has been increased demand for used and recycled construction materials. The project recruits difficult-to-place long-term unemployed -at present some 30 persons are employed- and this year the project will be able to offer work for 15 more. The Construction Materials project is an example of a social enterprise, in which the costs of the firm and salaries of permanent staff are covered by sales proceeds.

<p>Firstly, and most positively, the Commission believes that the Community has a lot in common with the United States. They both have a commitment to support agriculture; they are both major importers and exporters; and they share key interests in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agriculture negotiations.</p>
<p>Secondly, on questions such as biotechnology and health restrictions, the Commission found an improving understanding of the Community position and a greater willingness to listen. But fundamental differences remain. The Commission was able to press Community's case for restrictions on imports due to FMD to be regionalised, in line with scientific advice.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is a willingness in the new Administration and in Congress, to try to understand better the Community's policy and the true extent of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms. The Commission believes that there is an opportunity to change the way transatlantic business is conducted, in particular to work constructively on trade irritants.</p>
<p>Fourthly, and this is not so positive, the Commission has seen little evidence that the United States is heading in a positive direction in respect of domestic farm support and export subsidisation. The focus of discussion for farm support is on "counter-cyclical" measures. That is, when prices or incomes (which are a function of price) are low, the government will make up the expected difference with cash. This will impede market signals to farmers and lead to chronic problems of over-production and falling prices. As for export subsidies, while the Community record is one of transparency, reduction, and discipline within World trade organisation (WTO) rules, the United States is expanding the various non-transparent ways in which the government promotes exports, which completely escape current WTO discipline.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also asks about new initiatives to secure the future of American farmers in rural areas. As just mentioned, the main discussion seems to be on the "counter-cyclical" policy of shielding farmers from the market without getting any tax-payer value in return.</p>
<p>However, one initiative recently put forward by the new Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Tom Harkin, should be mentioned. He has proposed "conservation security" programmes, whereby farmers would be paid to provide environmental benefits from their farming operations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0496"></a>

<p>Indeed, as the Honourable Member points out, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recently revealed that the amount of obsolete pesticides existing in the world is five times higher than previously thought.</p>
<p>All obsolete pesticides, being unfit for use, must be considered as waste, and more precisely as hazardous waste due to their dangerous properties. Therefore, their disposal has to follow all the provisions of the legislation on hazardous waste, and has to be closely monitored.</p>
<p>This subject is of considerable concern to the Community, as demonstrated by the adoption and signing by the Commission on behalf of the Community of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) at the Diplomatic Conference on 21-23 May 2001. Among the twelve pollutants addressed in this Convention, nine are mainly used as pesticides.</p>
<p>The Community and its Member States are strongly committed to a rapid and effective implementation of the provisions of the POPs Treaty. This should be achieved by providing adequate technical and financial assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in order to help them meet the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Community pledge is also fully consistent with the work carried out by several other international organisations on the obsolete pesticides issue (namely, FAO, UNEP, WHO, Basel Convention secretariat). A concrete example is the recent financial support provided by the Commission to the 6<span class="sup">th</span> International HCH (Hexachlorohexane) &amp; Pesticides Forum held in Poland which emphasised the importance of disposing of stocks of obsolete pesticides, in particular in Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, in the framework of its Development Policy, the Commission has also recently financed the production of the manual Control of Pesticides and IPM, which gives practical guidelines on how to deal with obsolete pesticides, among other issues. Such guidelines have been widely distributed among the Services.</p>
<p>The Stockholm Convention is a very important step towards achieving the environmentally-sound disposal of not only the pesticides included in the Convention but of all obsolete pesticides, by putting this issue high on the political agenda due to the very serious risks to the environment they constitute.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0498"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the risk of increased financial crime during the changeover period.</p>
<p>All necessary measures are being taken to minimise this risk. For that purpose, the Commission closely collaborates with Europol and the European Central Bank (ECB) on the protection of the euro.</p>
<p>A package of legislative measures has already come into force respectively will come into force before long.</p>
<p>This includes, among others, a basic Regulation laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and a Decision on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting to be adopted by the Council; the Council Decision extending Europol’s role to cover counterfeiting; a framework Decision increasing penalties and sanctions against counterfeiting; the Council’s Directive on money laundering, including the proposal amending this Directive; the Commission proposal for a Council Decision establishing a training, exchange and assistance programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of Guidelines, Recommendations and Communications have been issued by the ECB and the Commission, while Europol's role in protecting the euro has been emphasised in the Council conclusions.</p>
<p>On the level of implementation of the technical and law enforcement procedures, work is well advanced in Member States, Europol and the ECB.</p>
<p>Finally, at European level, co-ordination among the main bodies and institutions concerned, is organised at the steering group for the protection of the euro, with participation of the Commission, the ECB and Europol.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0500"></a>

<p>Assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) aims at ensuring the country’s effective participation in the Stabilisation and Association Process. The assistance is therefore linked to the implementation of various requirements contained by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement of which FYROM was the first country in the region to conclude one. It is strategically programmed to bring the country closer to Union standards and principles, to facilitate the process of economic and social transformation towards a market economy and to underpin and support the achievements to date in the field of democracy by strengthening the institutional and administrative capacity of the state.</p>
<p>FYROM was allocated an amount of EUR 25 million in the year 2000 under the PHARE programme. An amount of EUR 42.5 million will be made available from the CARDS 2001 programme to support political and economic reform of the country. The 2001 programme takes account of recent developments and tries to tackle some of the root causes to the conflict, notably through actions such as the SEE University, the Small Scale Infrastructure Fund for municipalities and the Small Project Fund, all of which target inter ethnic co-operation and reconciliation. On top of the mainstream funding, FYROM received EUR 30 million macro financial assistance in loans and grants in 2000, however further allocations during this year are subsequent to fulfilment of reform conditions.</p>
<p>The Commission decided last year to support the establishment of the South East Europe University (SEEU) near Tetovo in the country as an important step in providing for the educational rights of the Albanian community there and inter-ethnic reconciliation in general. A contribution of EUR 1 million was made under the 2000 budget, followed by another EUR 4 million under the 2001 budget. The contribution of EUR 1million has already been paid; the remaining EUR 4 million contribution was due to be paid in the first week in June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0501"></a>

<p>The project to supply Thessaloniki with water from the River Aliakmon is intended to cover the drinking water supply needs of the town of Thessaloniki in the north of Greece.</p>
<p>This important Cohesion Fund project has suffered a series of delays which are due, according to information from the competent Greek authorities, to:</p>
<p>- legal problems such as complaints about the granting of public contracts for certain parts of the work, delays relating to controls undertaken by the Greek authorities of certain companies responsible for construction;</p>
<p>- internal problems within a large construction company (Ergomichaniki) which is responsible for part of the work;</p>
<p>- the modification of the studies concerning the water treatment plant, resulting from the competent authorities having decided to apply stricter quality standards than those initially laid down;</p>
<p>- archaeological finds requiring a substantial amount of work in order to move or bypass them adequately ;</p>
<p>- the modification of certain elements of the project in order not to interfere with work on the construction of the Egnatia motorway.</p>
<p>The accumulated delay is estimated by the Commission to be of around three and a half years. In relation to funding, the total cost of the project for the programming period 1994-1999 amounted to EUR 66 120 557 of which the Community contribution was EUR 56 202 474. For the period 2000-2006, an additional EUR 44.13 million have been allocated to this project, of which EUR 25.25 million are from the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>Total expenditure for this project, at the end of March 2001, amounted to EUR 61.2 million.</p>
<p>Given the difficulties encountered, the Commission has increased its monitoring of this project and has asked the authorities responsible for its management, and the ultimate beneficiary, to provide it with regular progress reports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Seven territorial employment pacts (TEPs) were presented to the Commission by the Greek authorities for approval in the beginning of 1998. Following a proposal by the Ministry of National Economy the TEPs were incorporated as a separate sub-programme in the respective Regional Operational Programmes for Thessaly, Western Macedonia, Peloponese, Eastern Macedonia, Continental Greece and Attica.</p>
<p>The actions proposed and approved under the seven Greek Pacts have a strong element of combined training, on-the-job training and employment promotion, mainly in the fields of domestic economy, promotion of entrepreneurship in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), involving in some cases disadvantaged people and innovative environmental projects in agriculture.</p>
<p>The local employment generated by the Pacts was foreseen to be approximately 600 posts in a period of two years.</p>
<p>The partnership arrangements have mobilised to a great extend the local actors creating a valuable experience and a substantial precedent for the establishment of the bottom up approach at regional and local level in Greece. Difficulties have been encountered in mobilising to a larger extend the private sector. However, the close collaboration of local authorities, social partners and local development agencies in taking up and promoting local employment initiatives creates an element of innovation in Greece.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Greek Pacts is foreseen to take place until the end of 2001. An evaluation report on the quantitative and qualitative impact in generating employment and achieving the objectives set is expected by June 2002 on the occasion of the closure of the Regional Operational Programmes under the Community support framework (CSF) 1994-1999 for Greece.</p>

It should not be inferred that projects not appearing on that graph will not be carried out before 2010.</p>
<p>European Parliament and Council Decision 1692/96 on the guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Network (TEN) defines the general reference framework for the creation of links to be gradually put in place by 2010.

<p>In accordance with Article 156 of the EC Treaty, these guidelines and specific projects are defined with the approval of the Member States involved.</p>

<p>The Commission, however, would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to its substantial support for the creation of that link. The first studies for the high-speed rail link between Cordoba and Malaga were funded in 2000 under the financial instrument for the TENs. The total cost of these studies is EUR 12 million and the Community co-finances 50% of that cost, in other words, EUR 6 million. These studies should be completed by the end of 2001.</p>
<p>The Integrated Operational Programme for Andalusia 2000-2006 provides, furthermore, for co-financing from the Structural Funds for the construction of this link, that is, of 155 km of double-track line connecting Cordoba to Malaga at a maximum speed of 350 kph, thereby extending the high-speed Madrid-Cordoba-Seville line towards the south-east.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0509"></a>

<p>The Television Without Frontiers Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council) provides the legal framework for television broadcasting within the Community.</p>
<p>In addition, the Recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services was adopted by the Council on 28 May 1998. The Recommendation aims to provide guidelines for national legislation. The Recommendation offers guidelines for the development of national self-regulation regarding the protection of minors and human dignity.</p>
<p>The Directive provides that each Member State shall ensure that all television broadcasts transmitted by broadcasters under its jurisdiction comply with the rules of the system of law applicable to broadcasts intended for the public in that Member State.</p>
<p>However, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Directive does not affect the responsibility of the Member States and their authorities with regard to the organisation - including the systems of licensing, administrative authorisation or taxation - financing and the content of programmes. Member States may, therefore, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, establish rules concerning the content of programmes broadcast by broadcasters within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A regulation in this area at Community level, could only be considered if the establishment and functioning of the Internal Market called for the approximation of the provisions currently applied by the Member States in this field.

<p>Does the Commission consider that the Trollhätte canal, the Göta river, lake Vänern, lake Mälaren and the Södertälje canal should be covered by Community legislation on inland waterways transport or not?</p>
<p>If the Trollhätte canal and lake Vänern, for example, were part of the land transport system, no levies would be payable and the Swedish state would be responsible for investments in the same way as for roads and railways. The waterway in question is principally operated by the shipping line of Vänerhamn AB. This firm is opposed to a change to the current situation, pointing out the Sweden has no equivalent to the inland waterways transport which exists on the continent. There is, however, a great deal of uncertainty, particularly in Western Sweden, about which category inland waterways will be placed in.</p>
<p>Does the Commission have any view on whether the Trollhätte canal, the Göta river, lake Vänern etc should be covered by legislation on inland waterways in the EU? Can the Commission state whether economic aid from the Community to transport in this sector would be greater if it were covered by Community legislation on inland waterways transport?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In principle, the Commission considers it desirable for Community legislation in the field of inland navigation to be applied to all inland waterways, but it accepts, on the basis of information provided by the Swedish authorities, that the Swedish inland waterways, although located in the interior of the country, should be considered as maritime and obey maritime regulations and not the regulations in the field of inland navigation. Likewise, the vessels navigating them are subject to maritime technical standards. Therefore, the Commission considers that the inland waterways mentioned by the honourable Member do not fall within the scope of the Community legislation on inland navigation.</p>
<p>Swedish waterways such as the Trollhätte canal, the Göta river and lake Vänern etc. are not subject to European Parliament and Council Decision No 1692/96/E<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>C<span class="sup">1</span> of 23 July 1996 on the Community guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network, and are not, therefore, eligible for Community funding.

<p>On 21 May 2001 Mr Ismail Cem reiterated the threat of action by Turkey if Cyprus became an EU Member State before the Cypriot problem was resolved (political committee of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly). In addition, in a circular to 14 of the EU Member States ambassadors in Ankara excluding the Greek ambassador, the Turkish foreign ministry warned of increased tension in Cyprus and called for the process of Cypriot accession to the EU to be halted.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Turkish national defence Council of 29 May 2001 indicated that peace and security in the eastern Mediterranean would be endangered if Cyprus joined the EU.</p>
<p>Will the Commission take steps to stop Turkey from issuing these threats and if so what steps will it take?

<p>The Union discusses the issue of Cyprus in the framework of the enhanced political dialogue with Turkey. The next opportunity will be at the EU/Turkey Association Council of 26 June 2001. The Commission is of the opinion that a settlement of the Cyprus issue should be reached though the good-offices talks under the aegis of United nations (UN) Secretary General which should resume as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As regards the accession of Cyprus to the Union, the Commission would like to recall the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council which state at point 9.b: "The European Council underlines that a political settlement will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council’s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition. In this the Council will take account of all relevant factors."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
