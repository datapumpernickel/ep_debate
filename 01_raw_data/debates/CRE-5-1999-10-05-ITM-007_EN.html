<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ahern (Greens/ALE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, I should like first of all to welcome Commissioner de Palacio to this House today. I look forward to working cooperatively with her. I cannot, however, let the information that I have just received about the nuclear accident in South Korea go unrecognised. I was very shocked and saddened to hear of the deaths of 22 workers, apparently as the result of a heavy water accident. That underlines what we are trying to do here today and the need for changes in energy policy and in the budget for energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. SAVE II focuses on the non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and therefore does not pay for hardware investments. The purpose of the programme is rather to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted and where energy efficiency will be recognised as a market opportunity. We have heard about the difficulties of competition and renewable energy, but energy saving also saves money and, therefore, is a good investment all round.</p>
<p class="contents">The SAVE programme was thoroughly and positively evaluated in 1994. I congratulate the Commission on the way it was run: credit where credit is due. This House gives kicks to the Commission when it sees programmes badly run. When a programme is well run and has been evaluated as such, we must also give it credit.</p>
<p class="contents">The evaluation highlighted SAVE as a valuable policy instrument to promote energy efficiency but stressed that a clear and consistent strategy for pilot actions was required; that dissemination of results is the key to long-term success; and that long-term effectiveness requires better on-going monitoring and impact analysis. The evaluation also showed that SAVE actions will also indirectly lead to the achievement of the objectives of the non-nuclear energy R&amp;D programme through the creation of a positive environment for the dissemination and implementation of new technology in renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments proposed by this report are a direct result of this evaluation. Energy efficiency means lower consumption, the conservation of non-renewable energy sources and reduced dependence on energy imports, but most of all it means lower levels of environmental pollution from harmful substances such as CO2, one of the major causes of the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has often underlined the importance of energy-efficient actions and the Council has also emphasised the need for energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions in a series of resolutions. However, these announcements have been followed up by very modest proposals. The energy savings targets will, in all likelihood, not be achieved by the means foreseen in the SAVE II programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Community has so far not been able to agree on what is probably the most effective instrument for the reduction of greenhouse gases – namely, the taxation of energy consumption – the Commission and the Council regard the SAVE II programme as “an important and necessary instrument”. Why then make cuts in an already low budget? That is why I have restored the budget figures originally proposed by the Commission which were fully justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the expected increase in the energy CO2 emissions and the low budget allocated to SAVE II it is rather unlikely that the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions could be achieved by this programme. However, under the energy framework programme SAVE II offers an opportunity to reverse a trend. Since at Member State level progress has stagnated, the responsibility for achieving energy efficiency targets and meeting reduction commitments now lies with the Community. The Finnish presidency has therefore announced an action plan for energy efficiency during the second half of 1999. It is very welcome and important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission argues in favour of setting a Community energy efficiency target. Given the approximately 1% annual improvement in energy efficiency in final consumption achieved so far, the Commission calls for a target of reducing energy intensity in final demand by a further percentage point per year. Given our commitments, as already underlined, it is incomprehensible that the Commission could confine itself to such a target. A goal of a further one-and-a-half percentage points should be set in order to develop additional savings potential. As you know, Parliament agreed this at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to add two technical points. We have, on legal advice, improved the comitology amendments. Therefore we have replaced Amendment No 5 by a new Amendment No 13, and Amendment No 11 by a new Amendment No 12. This was on legal advice to improve the original amendments. I hope that will be acceptable to everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, rapporteur, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, for the dynamism with which she has taken up the work of the previous rapporteur Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on the multiannual programme to promote energy efficiency, SAVE II for the 1998-2002 period, and has prepared it for the second reading in this Chamber. In addition, I would like to thank the Commission for the preparatory work it has carried out. SAVE, the joint programme for energy efficiency and energy savings, is an important and necessary part of the European Community’s strategy to promote efficient energy consumption and also to reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The SAVE programme is to be supplemented as a policy instrument by the specific programme covering issues relating to energy, the environment, and renewable energy technologies which forms part of the fifth framework programme for activities in the field of research, technological development and demonstration. A number of objectives relating to the emission of greenhouse gases were set in Rio de Janeiro and Berlin. In addition, the EU undertook to comply with a number of important statements on this subject in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has now come to turn the fine words uttered in Kyoto into deeds. The EU is in a position to take on the mantle of pioneer and under no circumstances must Kyoto be allowed to degenerate into a pointless paper exercise. That is why I would like, on behalf of our group, to urge the new European Commissioner to produce more far-reaching proposals which will enable the Kyoto objectives to be realised. What we need is for Commissioner Bolkestein to finally get round to a decision on the eco-tax at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is every chance that the EU will fail to meet the objectives relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions. The SAVE programme can provide a counterbalance to such developments. But then again, one should not expect much of this programme. What is more, the budget is very low, which is why our group warmly welcomes the rapporteur’s proposal to increase the SAVE programme’s budget by EUR 4.4 million to EUR 68.4 million.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not set ourselves unrealistic objectives. It will be possible, between now and the year 2000, to bring about a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of between 180 and 200 million tons by further improving the energy intensity of the final demand by 5% as compared with normal expectations. The rapporteur proposes improving the energy intensity of final consumption by one and a half extra percentage points per year over and above the percentage that would otherwise be attained.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our group believes that this is an unrealistic aim. Indeed, it has become apparent that one extra percentage point per year will be quite difficult enough to achieve. That is why we intend to vote against the rapporteur’s proposal on that point and opt for one per cent. Should it become apparent, in the fullness of time, that it is possible to achieve more, then of course we will be the first to raise the target. But we must take care not to present households, energy companies and the like with objectives which, of course, sound marvellous in practice but which are just not realistic. That would be very demotivating for those who have to do what is necessary to meet these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">My group feels that some of the proposals made by the rapporteur go into too much detail. The rapporteur has placed the main stress on legislation. We believe that only a framework should be created at European Union level. According to the principle of subsidiarity, a considerable proportion of the measures for increasing energy efficiency must be taken at national, regional and local level. That is why the PPE group will reject those amendments that prescribe an overly rigid framework. Instead of this, I feel that it would be a much better idea to draw up various incentives measures which will encourage governments and the business community to conclude voluntary agreements, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Experiences in my country have shown that in many cases more is achieved as a result of voluntary agreements than as a result of obligations imposed by legislation. It is better to make use of the resourcefulness of the parties involved than to impose obligations on them in this area by means of legislation. Mr President, to conclude I would like to touch on another important theme. I wish to emphasis anew the importance of the proposal to throw open the SAVE programme to associate countries in Central and Eastern Europe. A very great deal remains to be done in Central and Eastern Europe. The energy sectors in these countries are lagging far behind the EU Member States when it comes to energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also still a huge amount to be organised in terms of legislation. But when it comes to saving energy, these countries stand to achieve so much more than EU countries by employing the same efforts, which is why the returns would be so much greater. I therefore hope that energy companies in EU Member States in particular, that have a great deal of experience of projects in the field of energy efficiency, can share their knowledge with these countries and, Commissioner, it is my special hope that these energy companies then have a real chance as far as projects are concerned and are not just shoved aside by American companies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy efficiency is one of the few obvious contributions towards the attainment of the targets set for the EU in Kyoto. By saving energy, we produce fewer CO2 emissions and other pollutants. We also make our businesses more competitive. We can create thousands of much needed jobs and we can allow gas and electricity suppliers to make their money in a more sensible way by selling the services which energy gives us – warm homes, cool fridges and machines which work – rather than selling increasingly large amounts of gas and electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">The main area in which work is needed is actually that of domestic householders. They use more energy than industry and they use it in a profligate way. That is why many of the measures in SAVE II are aimed at households – better design of houses, more economical household appliances and effective education programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr van Velzen, I support very strongly the rapporteur’s amendment raising the percentage of savings to 1.5% above what would happen anyway. We only have to look at the progress in some Member States, including the Netherlands, to see that this is a perfectly attainable percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the use of regional and local networks like Federene, Energie Cities and Islenet is one of the most effective ways in which to bring about change, and I hope they will be specifically encouraged in SAVE II as they were in SAVE I. It is important, of course, that we monitor SAVE II and that its achievements are quantified. Our committee will shortly be putting in place a mechanism to ensure that we monitor all spending programmes very closely. SAVE II could be an example of how funding can be used in other EU programmes such as structural funds and funding for third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget again is inadequate. This programme is not enough on its own either. I hope, Commissioner, that you will persevere with the philosophy behind the rational planning directive. I am pleased that you have done so so far, and we look forward to your next communications on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very good to start the work of this new Parliament with programmes which can make a difference, both to the environment and, of course, to the competitiveness needs of our Member States. Like ALTENER, SAVE II is one of those programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Liberal Group considers promoting energy efficiency to be a key factor in the European Union’s energy policy. However, if the Union wishes to pursue a credible energy policy, then the time will come when the Commission and Council will, at last, have to draw conclusions from the previous SAVE programmes. This is a necessary prerequisite for the third SAVE programme, which has a great deal to offer, being able to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the energy markets is currently in full swing, resulting in considerable price reductions. According to the economic principles that normally apply, offering energy at lower prices is diametrically opposed to the call for consumption to be reduced. Energy-saving measures risk fading away against such a background. That is why it falls to us to adopt the SAVE programme so that the liberalisation of the energy markets can go hand in hand with increased energy efficiency within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It will only be possible to secure the effectiveness of the SAVE programme if adequate publicity is given to the initiative and there is substantial follow-up to the SAVE III programme projects and activities which are to be financed. This can best be achieved by setting concrete objectives. That is why the Liberals will give their full support to amendments 2 and 5 which aim to increase the energy efficiency of the final demand by 1.5 extra percentage points per year. If we want to achieve our goals, then we really do need to have the courage to set high standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the reference to renewable energy sources, on the other hand, appears to me to be inopportune. It can only cause confusion with the ALTENER programme. In any case, to my mind, the best thing to do as regards renewable energy sources would be to enter into a preparatory and searching debate about access to the electricity grid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that governments have an important role to play when it comes to leading by example in matters relating to rational energy consumption. This position is in stark contrast to the observation that, equally, government buildings could be described for the most part as archetypal wasters of energy. Citizens that have cause to enter government buildings ought to be able to see that saving energy is a concern to which the government gives priority. It would thus be a good idea to designate a Mr or Mrs Energy whose specific task would be to strictly monitor energy consumption in government buildings. Let us lead by example ourselves in this respect and start by designating a Mr or Mrs Energy in the European Parliament in both Brussels and Strasbourg. Simple measures are usually far more effective than long-winded programmes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So promoting energy efficiency should also be a natural part of any energy policy. If we take the Kyoto targets seriously – as we hopefully do – then we must also follow them up with the relevant tools and resources. In the programme we have before us, tools and funding are both inadequate and are not given a high enough priority. In view of the obligations we have assumed in regard to CO2 reduction, it is urgently necessary to establish ambitious efficiency targets. I therefore find it incomprehensible that the Commission wants to enhance levels of final energy by only 1 percentage point per year. As Mrs Ahern pointed out, the target ought to be at least 1.5%, and the budget ought also to be larger.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the previous speaker, I do see the need for a reduction in CO2 emissions linked to programmes for renewable energy sources, such as the ALTENER programme. Linking of this kind means that nuclear power cannot merely be left, as some would wish, to replace existing power stations which pollute the atmosphere with CO2 emissions. It is often emphasised that nuclear power is one of the cleanest energy sources and does not discharge greenhouse gases. I totally disagree with this. Technical progress in recent years has markedly improved the efficiency of renewable energy sources and, instead of giving so many resources to the nuclear industry in Europe as the Community is notorious for doing, efforts to promote renewable energy sources should be strengthened. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also completely in agreement with Mr Van Velzen in believing that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be permitted to take part in this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brunetta (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern for her work on highlighting the importance of promoting energy efficiency. Greater energy efficiency will mean less consumption in the medium-term, safeguarding renewable energy sources, less dependence on energy imports as well as less environmental pollution. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points on the draft recommendation for second reading, keeping in mind that the SAVE programme is aimed mainly at strengthening research and the exchange of know how, as well as monitoring the results achieved in the sector (Article 2), despite the limited financial resources. </p>
<p class="contents">My points are that firstly, as for today’s discussion on the proposal to set the improvement of energy intensity of final consumption at 1.5% a year – via an amendment to Recital 15 and to Article 1 – I think this goal is certainly ambitious but not very realistic. It is also harmful for the users who have successfully, and with notable efforts, reached the targets set out in the SAVE 1 programme (1991-1995). </p>
<p class="contents">As regards this, I would remind you that efficient energy use in the short-term costs firms as much as it does final consumers. So we need to carefully evaluate the objectives for improving energy intensity in final consumption. We might risk burdening our production apparatus with costs that will cause our firms to be less competitive with regard to other international competitors who are not bound by these obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying with the aim of making our production system competitive and efficient on a global scale, I will now move on to my second point. I would like to remind you that it is not always effective to promote efficient energy use using extremely restrictive, even intolerable legislative instruments and standards. Saving energy is a complex process, one which needs to develop gradually and is geared to gaining technological and economic knowledge for firms and users alike, but this will take some time. </p>
<p class="contents">So, I welcome the awareness campaigns on subjects linked to saving energy, but I do not see how adopting excessively prescriptive legislation could be the most efficient way of improving the energy intensity of final demand. I refer here to Amendment 1 to Recital 11, to new Recital 15a and to Amendment 6 to Article 1. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, in the light of these remarks, I would like to draw your attention to the need to carry out long-term cost/benefit analyses on the introduction of measures to reduce energy intensity of the final demand. These are very complex areas where the market and its regulations come into conflict with public welfare considerations. These analyses are possible in transparent markets where the individual end user – firm or consumer – can always assess to what point energy use is efficient thanks to gradual progress in the technological and economic spheres, sustained by sound research and as much information as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I would also like to thank Mrs Ahern and Mrs McNally for having congratulated the Commission on the development of this type of action, which the officials of the Commission will also be grateful for.</p>
<p class="contents">Once approved, this programme will become an important component of the multiannual framework programme for energy, providing a greater degree of transparency and better coordination of our programmes in the energy industry, allowing Parliament to fulfil its monitoring role in the interests of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report of the Honourable Member and proposed amendments, Mrs Ahern, I would like to say that, in principle, the majority of them are acceptable. In the case of Amendment No 4, as we said earlier in relation to the ALTENER programme, there is a clear need for renewable energy and energy efficiency to go hand in hand. All of this constitutes one of the basic objectives of the multiannual framework agreement on energy, which is aimed specifically at improving complementarity and coordination in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendments Nos. 12 and 13, which replace Amendments Nos. 11 and 5, which the Honourable Members have referred to, and which refer to the involvement of Committees, I would like to say that they are acceptable in principle but require another more appropriate wording. I can say the same for Amendment No 10, which proposes an increase in the budgetary item which restores the Commission’s initial figures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to amendments which the Commission cannot accept, I would like to say that, firstly, there is the one which refers to increasing the ambitions of this programme, that is, achieving a saving of 1.5%. In my view we should not be setting unreasonable figures but rather discussing achievable and ambitious objectives, because the objective is 1% per year, which will add up and eventually lead to considerable savings. For this reason we can accept neither Amendment No 2 nor Amendment No 6, insofar as this issue is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legal aspect, the SAVE programme is not a legislative programme. Legislative action and proposals may be brought into play, but it is not in itself a legislative programme. For this reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 1 and 3, nor part of Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the SAVE programme is intended to provide a framework of action in the field of energy efficiency. We believe that this formula has worked adequately in the past and that it would not be advisable, even with the best intentions, to add too many details or standards which will ultimately hinder the effective implementation of the programme. We therefore require a certain degree of flexibility and for this reason we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 8 and 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in the hope of finding a compromise, we can accept Amendment No 7, despite the fact that it presents a little difficulty, requiring some amendments of its wording.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to two questions which have arisen, firstly, I profoundly regret the nuclear accident in South Korea which has happened just days after the accident in Japan and which has affected a number of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to mention the Kyoto objective, to which energy efficiency is clearly of key importance. The Commission will briefly present – it is included in the agenda of the next Council of 2 December – the action plan on energy efficiency, and then we will have the opportunity to discuss these questions in more depth.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a final matter which I had left out, which is the participation of some countries in Central and Eastern Europe, I would like to say that currently there are ten countries which are benefiting from the SAVE programmes in order to bring about an improvement in energy efficiency. When we compare data on energy efficiency we find differences of 1:5 and 1:6 in relation to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by congratulating Mrs Ahern once again, thanking all of you for your positive participation in this matter, and Parliament for the support it has lent the Commission in this field and, simply, by saying that we are talking about something very important which is the intelligent use of resources and energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
