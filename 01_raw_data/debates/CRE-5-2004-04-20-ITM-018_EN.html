I would like now to thank her for the openness she has shown toward Parliament over the years. As far as the role of rapporteur for the agencies that has been given to me is concerned, all I can tell you is that, based on the knowledge I have now, there is no reason to refuse to grant discharges to the agencies. That does not mean, of course, that there are no improvements to be made. We noted a number of matters last year with the agencies that will probably need more attention.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place there is the personnel policies they are pursuing. We would like to see greater transparency in general. How are people recruited and how do they get promotion? There are indications that this is done differently from how it is done in the Commission, whereas once these people become civil servants for an agency, they have the same rights and duties as civil servants working for the Commission. We think that this should be levelled up as far as possible. We also think that OLAF is fully entitled to get involved in the event of any problems with agencies. Finally, we think that the internal audit service of the Commission must pay more attention to what is going on in the agencies. Up to now this service has not had the time or has not had the inclination to get involved. We believe that it must do so in future.</p>
<p class="contents">With some agencies that have their own incomes, there is a problem with the balances being carried over from one budget year to the next. Agencies can have their own incomes, but under the rules of the Financial Regulation, they may not use this income in the next budget year. A solution has been found for one agency, the agency in London. We think this solution should also apply to the other agencies. As a general rule, we also want to encourage agencies, where possible, to generate more income for themselves, so they cost the budget less.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would also like to say something about the other agencies, but then in a personal capacity, in other words not as rapporteur. We are following Mr Bayona in his decision to grant a discharge to the Commission. I can more or less reiterate the comments of last year and of the years before that. It is still extremely unsatisfactory that there is no positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors. Every effort must be made to get this. We can only conclude that if we were to refuse to grant a discharge at this point in time, this would not serve any useful purpose at all, as the political consequences at the moment would not be in the interests of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Now something about the Eurostat affair. There has been an explanation from the Commission this afternoon. As far as I am concerned, this explanation is not enough. This explanation from the Commission says nothing about the essence of the matter: political accountability. We heard from Mr Prodi, when he took up his position as President of the Commission, that there would be political accountability. We think that the Commission’s interpretation of this lacks substance. A Commissioner is responsible for the task assigned to him and should also render an account of that. If something goes wrong, he or she must take responsibility for that. We think it is a pity that three months ago, in response to the Kasaka follow-up report on the discharges for 2001, an amendment put forward by the Liberals was adopted with a majority of only one vote. In that amendment we said that it was regrettable that Commissioner Solbes had not taken political responsibility from day one. Clearly there is a different atmosphere in Parliament now, when we consider the many amendments that I now see to the Bayona report. All I am saying is that there was not as much opposition from the large groups in Parliament two or three months ago as there is now.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the hearings before the new Commission at the end of the year, one of the important points we must emphasise must be what the Commissioners’ individual responsibilities are with respect to the implementation of the budget. After all, if we make every civil servant at the Commission responsible for his or her own area of work, then that should certainly also apply to the Commissioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to concur with the words of Mr Mulder and I too would like to thank Mrs Schreyer for the dedication she has shown over the past five years and for the candour with which she has entered into the debate. Although we belong to the same political family, we have not always agreed with each other. We sometimes held different views, but I have always very much appreciated the way in which we have been able to cooperate with all of Parliament. I would expressly like to thank you for that, Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few days before enlargement, we are debating here the implementation of the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community for the budget year ending on 23 July 2002. Let us say it frankly and freely: the ECSC was the first concrete cooperation in Europe between partners who had fought bloody wars against each other three times in the sixty years before. Wars that caused great personal suffering and millions of unnecessary deaths. The stories of my own grandfather who, as a young newly married man, slaved in the trenches of the IJzer near Ypres in the 1914-1918 war and the stories in our family about what happened to him always made a very strong impression on me. They made me a confirmed pacifist, a confirmed supporter of the Flemish Movement and a confirmed European.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation between France and Germany started with cooperation in the field of the two large industrial sectors of the time, coal and steel, and was later expanded to economic cooperation and a European agricultural policy. All in all, this cooperation has ensured that we here in the European Union have lived in peace for sixty years. I think that this point should be made once again most emphatically, especially in the run up to the campaign for the European elections of 10 and 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Rühle’s report, that is before us today, is not controversial. Nor have any amendments been submitted. The report rightly expresses respect for the virtues of all those who instituted and shaped the ECSC and, therefore, made a very concrete contribution to the unification of Europe. The ECSC is now in liquidation, after operating for fifty years. The Rühle report clearly indicates what measures the Commission and the Court of Auditors will still have to take in the coming months and years. Commissioner, Parliament is counting on this being done with the utmost scrupulousness and that will also be evident from the vote tomorrow afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased that the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control to grant discharge to the Commission for 2002 and close the accounts is now before the House. The draft discharge decision is based on the detailed work carried out by the European Court of Auditors and on the outstanding, highly professional and comprehensive report by the rapporteur, Mr Bayona. The European Parliament's decision on granting discharge for 2002 is therefore a balance-sheet and a guideline for further measures. This is in line with the intentions of the Treaty and the Financial Regulation. I would like to congratulate Mr Bayona on his extraordinarily full report which is almost a compendium in itself, and thank him very warmly on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the reports by Mr Sjöstedt on the European Development Funds, by Mr Mulder on the European Agencies, and by Mrs Rühle and Mr Staes on the ECSC. All the reports recommend that discharge be granted. They are full and detailed and make a range of recommendations to the Commission on how it can further improve financial management in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft decision granting discharge to the Commission expressly recognises the Commission's achievements in relation to the reforms. Yet the draft also claims that the administrative reforms announced by the Commission were barely more than window- dressing. With respect, this is difficult to reconcile. Let us take stock and remind ourselves, once again, what the situation was like five years ago. There was, after all, a general consensus among the Committee of Independent Experts, voiced in their report, as well as among the European Court of Auditors and the overwhelming majority of Members of this House that it was not enough to make individual adjustments to the management of the European Commission: fundamental reform and modernisation were required. The Prodi Commission addressed this task with great commitment from the outset. The White Paper 'Reforming the Commission', which was adopted as early as spring 2000, sets out 98 measures and I can today confirm that 95 of the actions defined have been implemented in full, and that implementation of the remaining three measures is progressing well.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the key elements of this reform? Firstly, the regulations on human-resource and financial management have been completely overhauled. Secondly, the entire system of budget management – from the establishment of the budget to budget structure, budget implementation, budgetary control and financial reporting – has been radically reformed. Thirdly, rules and organisational structures have to be implemented by real people, and the Prodi Commission, with the European Parliament's support, has not only rectified the gross staffing deficits, especially the shortage of financial managers, controllers and auditors, but has also defined financial management and internal auditing as recognised occupations in the Commission for the first time. In 2003 alone, 7 100 participants attended the training courses on financial issues. Twenty-nine courses were run in total, and more courses will be added in 2004. Is this really mere window dressing?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me focus on several aspects in detail. On the new regulations: the Prodi Commission has developed, negotiated and introduced two key management regulations. Firstly, there is the Staff Regulation: under the leadership of Mr Kinnock and his team, and after four years of intensive work, this proposal was finally adopted by the Council in March. We now have a fundamentally new, performance-oriented Staff Regulation for the public service in all the European institutions. I would also draw your attention to innovative features, such as the regular rotation of senior officials and officials in sensitive posts, which have now been introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new Financial Regulation: I hope you will allow me to dwell for a moment with some measure of pride on this achievement, for the new Financial Regulation has been realised within two and a half years. The old Financial Regulation was 25 years old. I am pleased that we – the Commission, Parliament, all the Member States, and the European Court of Auditors – have achieved this together. It is an outstanding piece of work by this House’s Committee on Budgets and the Council’s Economic and Financial Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a new financial management structure, a transparent legal framework for financial assistance and public procurement, clear definitions of the responsibilities of the financial actors, and, if necessary, penalties. Naturally, I was particularly gratified by the praise from Transparency International. All this makes the Financial Regulation a great success.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the management and control structures, it was necessary to modernise structures which, in some cases, dated back to the founding of the European institutions. In the field of financial management, we had central control of commitments and payments. This was a relic of a time when the budget was still small and its role was negligible. The main weakness of this system was that responsibility was transferred from the Directorate-General that managed the allocations to a centralised system of financial control. It was high time to change this format. We have now introduced, at last, a division of responsibilities which ensures proper and efficient financial management at European level too, in line with the mechanisms which are generally taken for granted at government level in the Member States. Under the new system, the responsibility for sound and efficient financial management lies with those who manage the funds. The Directors-General, as the authorising officers, now bear full responsibility for ensuring that appropriate financial systems have been established in their Directorates-General.</p>
<p class="contents">As a corollary, this decentralisation process naturally also requires the adoption of uniform standards of financial management, and this is what we have done. By the end of 2003, the Directorates-General had fulfilled 90% of these standards. This task too – the setting of uniform financial management standards – was far from being a minor undertaking; indeed, it was akin to a cultural revolution in our international organisation. Now, each Director-General must produce an Annual Activity Report in which he accounts for the management of the resources for which he is responsible. He must also provide a Declaration highlighting any weaknesses of which he is aware in his particular field of responsibility and outlining the related remedial measures taken or planned. These reports are submitted to Parliament and can also be accessed by the general public via the Internet. Please, give me other examples of such transparency – if there are any.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's handling of the Eurostat case is also an example of transparency. Where else would an executive body be so rigorous in investigating, uncovering and drawing conclusions from the mistakes made before its entry into office? The Prodi Commission – as my colleague has already explained once again on the Commission's behalf today – took action as soon as the scale of the problems became known. Naturally, this was a risky process in political terms, but this Commission's watchword was, and remains, 'zero tolerance to fraud'. This watchword does not guarantee that fraud will not occur. However, it does guarantee that nothing – absolutely nothing – will be swept under the carpet. Instead, investigations will be launched and action taken. The Prodi Commission has faced up to this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Two offices have played a prominent role in dealing with the aftermath of the Eurostat case. The first is the office of the Internal Auditor, which was established in 2000 and, from the outset, was accountable to the Vice-President of the Commission, which underlines the great importance attached to the role. Secondly, we have OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, whose primary task is to uncover fraud and irregularities within and outside the institutions by means of administrative investigations. Despite all the teething troubles – and we admit that these have occurred – OLAF is an effective anti-fraud mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would also like to mention the overhaul of the system of accounting and financial reporting as a key element of the reform, although I can discuss this in far more detail in the quarterly reports that I submit to you. This is an important element of our modernisation measures. Modernising the system of accounting will result in significant improvements: the introduction of accrual accounting, the adoption of financial statements into line with international standards, and the use of an integrated system to generate all accounting data. In the last 15 months of this project, a massive amount of work has been undertaken, as Mr Bayona de Perogordo and, indeed, Mr Sørensen and other members of the committee have seen for themselves. We are on track to fulfil the stringent requirements set out in the Financial Regulation by 2005 – and indeed, before the start of 2005. Let me make this point very clearly too: this modernisation strategy maps the Commission's progress towards fulfilment of the most up-to-date public sector accounting standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these measures adopted by the Commission stem from proposals and demands made by Parliament, especially by the Committee on Budgetary Control. Hundreds of people have been involved in the reform: Commission officials, MEPs, and staff of the Court of Auditors and the Council. The report by Mr Bayona de Perogordo reveals how comprehensive this reform has been. Is there anything left to do? Certainly. Mr Bayona's report reveals this as well. The amendment of the OLAF Regulation is just one example – it is now on the table – but above all, I should mention the project to establish the post of European Public Prosecutor to protect the European Community's financial interests. This project really should be given a chance to be implemented. On the basis of the new Constitution for the EU, it should be possible to establish a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, and if that is ever done, it will be due in no small measure to the work undertaken by Mrs Theato. Mrs Theato, you have lobbied tirelessly and competently for the establishment of this post and, more generally, you have made a lasting impact on the European Parliament's work in the field of budgetary control. Indeed, your name has become synonymous with parliamentary control of budgets at European level. I would like to express my warm thanks, on behalf of the Commission but also on my personal behalf, for your critical but very positive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prodi Commission was the first European Commission to accept that its management and administrative tasks are of equal value to its conceptual and negotiating agenda. Through its pro-active approach and spurred on by Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the Council, it has created a management system which equips the Commission for the challenges of the twenty-first century. This management system will have to prove its worth in a Union with 25, 27 or more Member States, with 20 or more official languages, and with a constantly new set of tasks and expenditure assigned to the Union. I am convinced that the reform work undertaken by the Commission has created a sound basis for this process, and I would like to conclude by thanking the European Parliament very warmly for its tireless support in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns a number of agencies that we have looked at and, in particular, it concerns the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao.</p>
<p class="contents">I was extremely surprised when I read the Court of Auditors' report, because the Court of Auditors accuses this agency of having carried over far too much. On closer examination, it turned out that this was in connection with an SME programme that we here in Parliament had resolved on. It took some time to reach agreement with the Commission about where this programme should be implemented, but eventually it was decided to give it to the agency in Bilbao. That, of course, is no fault of the agency in Bilbao, but nevertheless the Court of Auditors made a very negative comment about this. It would, of course, have been very easy for them to check that. You ask yourself sometimes: is that so? We all knew it here and rapporteur Mulder has stated that in the final version of his report, albeit rather less bluntly than I am doing. It would nevertheless be good if the Court of Auditors did not only look at the first level, but also went into things a bit deeper. That is my opinion on this matter; apart from that there are no problems with the agencies that we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rest are concerned, we confined ourselves in the main to the Structural Funds. There is always a problem with that and that is the problem that Member States always over-estimate how much they can get out of the Structural Funds. That leads to a budget that does not balance, and that leads at the end of the year to money that has not been spent. This is especially the case at the beginning of a period. I think that the Commission needs to be a bit less naive in this respect. Up to now it was the case that when a new period started, we got practically nothing off the ground in the first year. It would be good, of course, if we could do better than this in the future. This point should be organised better in the future than it is now, otherwise it means that we never learn anything from the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the Commission and Parliament decided a long time ago that gender budgeting would be applied to the budget. I note that this did not happen in 2002. There is a good report by Mrs Ghilardotti, that gives a proper technical explanation of what gender budgeting could be. It is already being applied in a number of states, so it should also be possible for the European Commission to apply it.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is that I am pleased about the fact that the women’s programme has been thrown open to the accession countries. We would like to see an evaluation of what has been done in connection with this programme in the accession countries, and that gender budgeting be also applied in all community programmes intended for the accession countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These include the amount of cash held in reserve, the need to avoid making payments to unauthorised persons, and the need for better coordination between the Agency’s accounting officer and the competent directorate of the Commission. Statements by the Agency in response to these points have made it possible for these concerns to be laid to rest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Foreign Affairs Committee is well aware of the difficult circumstances under which the Agency does its work. Let me say by way of conclusion, though, that the amount spent by the EU on aid must be rationally proportionate to its political benefit. The discharge report offers an opportunity to make that point. Whilst giving the agency discharge for the year 2002, we do expect the extension of its remit to the management of EU aid in Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia to result in long-term improvements in efficiency and hence to the political stabilisation of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to make a more general point, particularly with relation to the censure motion that will be debated tomorrow evening and the general discharge point, criticising the Commission on the disgraceful way that European funds are being managed under its control. We have all been amazed to see a whole succession of whistleblowers come forward to Members of this Parliament complaining about the way they have been disciplined and how large amounts of public funds have been disbursed by the Commission. My colleagues will certainly be voting against the discharge of the Commission's budget, as we have consistently throughout this Parliament, and this would certainly be my recommendation. It seems to me that electors across the EU will have no faith in any of the EU institutions – whether Parliament or Commission – until the terrible cases of fraud and mismanagement are firmly and severely dealt with and the people responsible in the Commission – Commissioners and Commission staff – take responsibility for the gross mismanagement that has occurred, and resign from their positions in the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the last discharge for the – current – Commission, and this is also the last time I will be taking part in a discharge procedure. So let me say a few words of thanks – to the Members of this House above all, and also in the committee, to the rapporteurs, and to our Bureau. Things have always been amicable, and I think that the great deal of work we have put in has also yielded a great deal of success.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Court of Auditors for its reports, on which our work has been founded, as well as the Commission and you, Commissioner. It is of course you whom we are monitoring and assessing. I think it can be said that the Commission and Parliament are more willing to engage in dialogue and are also more frank with each other, and for that I am grateful, although I found the earlier statement on Eurostat a great disappointment. The Committee on Budgetary Control will continue to shed critical light on the Commission’s activities, which is what it is meant to do.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission manages to improve the flow of information still further, including within itself, if there is real transparency and real responsibility, if it succeeds in reducing unwieldy bureaucracy and is more prompt in recognising and honestly admitting where things have gone wrong and abuses have occurred, then Parliament will be less harsh in its criticisms. The reforms for which we have striven have now been set in motion; they must not be put off to another day. You yourself said, Commissioner, that there is advice from Mr Bayona de Perogordo in his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put before you the three things that the public would like to see in the future Parliament: real representation of the citizens as a result of a high turnout at elections; collegial loyalty in order to avoid many of the criticisms in Mr van Hulten’s report, and – this is a personal wish of mine – to that end, a statute of our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, however, better than if the halves had been the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the second comment I would like to make. We are currently witnessing an attempt at misusing budgetary control and its competences in the service of a political campaign against the Community institutions, in this instance, and not for the first time, the Commission. That accusation I level not at my good friend Mr Heaton-Harris, nor at Mr Sjöstedt, nor even at Mr Bonde or Mr Callanan, who has delivered himself of what I regard as a rather surprising statement on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question, though, is whether the rest of the House is so blind as to join in. The question is not directed at those who campaign against the Community institutions, but at those who constitute the majority in this House, and I think we have to ask ourselves the critical question as to whether there are tendencies within us who sit on the Committee on Budgetary Control, in the way we work, that, inadvertently, give some people a pretext for what they are currently getting up to. Let me give you a few examples of what I mean.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as the anti-integrationist groups and minorities within the major groups have discovered the Committee on Budgetary Control as an instrument and a platform for their purposes, and started to work in it accordingly, some groups – and certain national delegations in particular – think that working in it is beneath them. That is the primary reason why certain political forces are able to put the Committee on Budgetary Control to their own uses.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have a substantial disagreement with Mr Mulder on the issue of political responsibility. What we need, I think, in this House is a bit more intercultural competence, which would prevent us from attempting to make our own national conceptions – in this instance, our conceptions of what political responsibility is – into general benchmarks for 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States, without having in any way examined whether the administrative and decision-making structures that we have are at all appropriate to them. That is something we have to examine before we do anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the committee, and to a few other behavioural traits to be found in it, which I find annoying, to put it mildly. If you are a Member of the Committee, you do not have to lend credibility to this or that rumour purveyed by the <span class="italic">European Voice</span> or some other source by rejoicing at the opportunity to get a couple of two-line mentions in the press, then adopting a worried frown and expressing your grave concern at the fact that such rumours are going around. If you do that, then you are, for a start, making the rumour credible to some degree. Before you do so, you should investigate whether certain rumours are backed up by objective facts. You do not have to jump at every tempting morsel held out by opponents of integration or by certain elements in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is that we have a tendency to present ourselves as whiter than white and, above all, as whiter than the others. There is a perilous competition here between some Members of the same nationality but belonging to different political groups. I hope you will not mind, Mr President, if I give an example. When I was a rapporteur myself, I once had two Members of a particular group sitting in my office, and they said to me, 'Mr Kuhne, you have drafted a wonderful report, to which we do not need to table any amendments, but we can not vote for it because we can not allow the people back home to think we are less keen on reform than the others.' That is another way in which the credibility of European institutions can be damaged, and from that we can all learn something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contains a series of criticisms, and it is only right that these areas should have been pointed out. In that connection, I should like to draw attention to the entire reform of the accounting system. A lot has happened in the last twelve to eighteen months. I think it good that, last year, we had a regulation introduced to the effect that, in future, the Commission should report on a quarterly basis to the Committee on Budgetary Control. What is quite excellent is that we have now had the opportunity to evaluate the progress made, but there are still major issues and problems to be solved by the Commission concerning the accounting system. We shall not have the final test of whether these have been solved successfully until we move over to the new system on 1 January. I hope that, here in Parliament today, Commissioner Schreyer will promise to go on giving impetus to the reform process, even if it takes place in the middle of the changeover to a new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I would draw attention to Mr van Hulten’s report. I think he has prepared a constructive report. It now gives us the opportunity to obtain some clearer rules governing Parliament’s activity, administration and Members. I think it will be good if we can put together a majority establishing that our travel expenses should be calculated as per account rendered. I also think it might be good to have it established that Parliament itself must have the ability to determine the place and times at which it assembles, and I would in any case call for this part of the report to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to conclude with a couple of words about political accountability. A number of matters have now been raised, or proposals made, with a view to debating political accountability. I think it is at the consultations that are to take place when the new Parliament assembles that we should put our energies into getting some principles governing Commissioners’ political accountability adopted. We should not put our energies into debating a matter that, in a way, has now been concluded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First and foremost, an observation for you, Mrs Theato. Mr Kuhne said that he only shared half of your journey in this Parliament. I have been with you for both halves. The first half as a political group assistant, the second as Member of Parliament. We have exchanged glances many times in the committee meetings, with me often trying to attract your attention to be allowed to speak. I thank you for the way you chaired our committee and with all our fellow committee members I say: we wish you well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the van Hulten report. Mr van Hulten has, in my opinion, produced an excellent report. He has rightly paid a lot of attention to following up my report on the discharges that were adopted last year. My report also focused a lot of attention on the seat of Parliament, our travelling popular theatre, and the fact that we have to work at three different locations. I think this is indefensible. The PPE-DE has submitted a number of amendments to scrap those paragraphs. I hope that we, together with the other groups, succeed in not allowing these amendments to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a paragraph on relations with local residents. I really do want to emphasise that this is of the utmost importance. We go to Brussels, we do not live on an island there. There is far too little contact between Members of Parliament and civil servants and the local residents. There needs to be a much more constructive dialogue with the residents of Leopoldswijk.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Eurostat affair. I am a bit surprised that we have to have a special debate about this. We are debating a compromise resolution tomorrow, which will probably include all the texts that we as Parliament have already adopted. I share Mr Mulder’s view on political accountability. Mr Kuhne says: we need greater intercultural understanding. I think that, after the new Parliament has been elected, we must explicitly ask the Commissioners in the hearings what they understand by political accountability, so that we never go through what we went through with Mr Solbes in recent years again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was not, however, the case, of course. It is difficult, not to say impossible, to comment on the approval procedure for the 2002 accounts in the space of one minute. This year again, I see, however, that there are many shortcomings in the Commission’s financial administration, that an unreasonable proportion of taxpayers’ money has, this year again, been used without the necessary guidance and control and that a very large amount of money has disappeared through fraud, misappropriation and downright theft.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue at the moment is, of course, Eurostat, for which the Commission does not wish to accept responsibility and which, as has been further proved today, the majority in this House wishes to sweep under the carpet. This year again, we are receiving assurances that everything is on the right track, but we know that that is not the case. We can only sit and wait for the next scandal and watch those responsible protect each other and fire their critics. This House bears a heavy responsibility by closing its eyes and voting in favour of approving accounts that should not be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend voting in favour of Mr van Hulten’s report but not in favour of the report on the Commission. If you will permit a final word of thanks, I would take this opportunity to thank Mrs Theato for her excellent chairmanship of the committee. Over the last five years, I have often felt I was spending more time with Mrs Theato than with my wife, and only rarely in the Chamber, so it will be really odd to have to do without her after the forthcoming elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Court of Auditors rejects the EU's accounts on an annual basis and has done so for the last nine years. There comes a time when we have to stop routinely nodding things through like clockwork monkeys in a tired charade of parliamentary scrutiny. The EU has no money of its own, but is spending taxpayers' money from all the Member States. We have a moral duty to those taxpayers to see that their money is spent wisely, not frittered away in a seemingly endless stream of abuses that line the pockets of unscrupulous civil servants and their cronies. I ask Members to set an example and vote against formal discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Eurostat affair, it is high time that Mr Brüner, Director-General of OLAF, resigned for having instigated the arrest of the investigative journalist Hans-Martin Tillack on baseless grounds. The Ombudsman accused Mr Brüner of maladministration in November 2003, yet he has not had the grace to resign. Meanwhile, Messrs Franchet and Byk, accused of massive fraud, have been allowed the privilege of stating their case at length to OLAF. However, Hans-Martin Tillack – innocent until proven guilty – has still not been heard by OLAF. Mr Brüner should go! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate him and I genuinely hope that, in particular, the paragraphs on our Parliament’s prerogatives on choosing our place of work are adopted and will, so to speak, form this outgoing Parliament’s political testament for the next Parliament in order that this issue of location can finally be dealt with in a sensible manner. We are launching into investment projects for new buildings in Brussels; it is time that all this moving around stops once and for all and, from this point of view, we must pay tribute to Mr van Hulten and to his work.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission discharge is concerned, we Radical Members will vote in favour of it, but we will also give much thought to the vote that there will be on the <span class="italic">Eurostat </span>issue. I would like to say to the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, that, of course, our disappointment and our feeling of frustration stem from many factors but, in particular, from the OLAF issue. It is unthinkable that, for four years, people and officials have been subject to a type of inquisition regime and the final result of a series of inquiries that should have been concluded a long time ago is not yet known. Therefore, for this and many other reasons, and also to urge the Commission and stress the fact that it must be accountable to this and the new Parliament, we believe that it is important that, alongside this discharge, there should also be a far-reaching resolution on the <span class="italic">Eurostat </span>issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely important report which offers many suggestions that must be taken into account and in which, regrettably, the issue that has concerned us most over recent years in the Committee on Budgetary Control remains outstanding: fraud in Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, with the support of the other groups, has promoted a resolution on this issue to make it clear before the end of this legislature that Parliament views this as a serious matter, that we are not satisfied with what the Commission has done so far, although we recognise it has made a great effort, but we want to know why this fraud took place and what mechanisms can prevent it from happening again in the future. That is our main interest. We do not want to get bogged down in other types of issue. We want an end to such fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">As a parliamentary committee, we have a particular interest in auditing management and, fundamentally, in combating fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our Chairman, Diemut R. Theato, on the excellent work he has done leading a very difficult committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control. She has been able to lead a very diverse team, from very different groups, which at the end of this legislature has been able to find the appropriate moment to feel like a team, a team in which we agree more than we disagree and in which we are inspired by a common interest, which is that the Commission, the whole of the European Union, should function better and better, that it should spend more efficiently, that there should be the best possible control of spending for the benefit of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">If the President will allow me, I would like to refer very briefly to the report by Mr van Hulten on Parliament. I agree with my fellow Members that it is a good report and that amongst all of us we have managed to produce a text which I believe will be widely supported tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we, on our last day in the job, so to speak, table a no-confidence motion in a Commission from which the main man has already departed – that being Mr Solbes Mira, who was responsible for Eurostat – then I have to tell the House that we risk making ourselves look ridiculous. If our Chairman – who is now leaving us – achieved anything of merit, it was to take our little Committee on Budgetary Control and make people take it seriously. So I warn you against coming up with more idiocies of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, we should be rather wary of congratulating ourselves. Looking at what the Commission managed to achieve throughout the whole Eurostat business – to which Members have already referred – I have to say that the end result was modest in the extreme. What made it that was that you, for months on end, simply ignored the reports and resolutions that this House had produced on the subject. This House may be at the end of its term, but we can still tell you that what we expect of any future Commission is another way of going about things. I hope that we will, in future, see that in another shape. That is our responsibility and the Commission's as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That confirmed the position taken up by my group that postponement of the discharge was necessary. It became apparent today that the Commission is still refusing to take responsibility for the fraud at Eurostat. That is typical of the arrogance and contemptuous attitude of the Commission toward Parliament and the citizens, whose tax revenues this is ultimately about.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example of bad policy concerns the poor organisation of the system for reclaiming sums wrongfully paid out. It is really shocking that the Commission is still paying out money to Member States as cool as you like, when they know that in 15% of the cases the control and management systems are not up to scratch. When is the Commission going to stop doing this and suspend part of the payment? When will the Commission have a complete and reliable debtors’ register in the accounts? Up to now it has been wasting its time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the Commission to promise that, before 1 May, in other words within 14 days, they will present Parliament with an assessment of the support for problem areas, regardless of whether all the Member States have fulfilled their duty to provide information. Then it will immediately become clear which Member States require special attention and we can get the members of our national parliaments to put pressure on their governments. There is a very great deal wrong in these problem areas. The validity of the distribution is open to dispute and the list of indicators in fact give the Member States <span class="italic">carte blanche</span>. Farmers working in similar circumstances do not receive equal subsidies and so on and so forth. There is plenty for you and your successors to do to put this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am asking for a clear response from the Commissioner to the suggestion to create a separate Directorate-General for accounting and combating fraud with effect from 2005, to bring to an end once and for all the merging of responsibilities in the present Directorate-General for the Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is a remarkably nice man and obviously a great author – an author of fiction. The Committee on Budgetary Control's report on the discharge of the 2002 Commission's accounts is probably the greatest work of fiction I have seen since I came to this Parliament. I am not as well read as many other Members here, but certain sections of it even have a science fiction tilt.</p>
<p class="contents">One wonders whether one is looking into the future and talking about what is happening or going to happen in 2005, or whether we are dealing with 2002, which is the year in question. It was in early January 2002 that Marta Andreasen started work for the Commission, and five months into 2002 that she was suspended from her role as an accounting officer for the Commission. So we know that in 2002 there are five months in which there was something wrong with the Commission's accounts. It makes no difference which side of this particular argument you are on – whether you think Marta Andreasen was completely unqualified for the task she was given, whether you think she was completely incompetent or whether you actually think she was right and tried to present a reform that was then blocked from inside the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must have thought that Christmas had come early when the rapporteur presented his report. It probably heard the reindeers' bells jingling and could not believe its luck.</p>
<p class="contents">Today a number of journalists have been following me around the Parliament; something seems to happen when an election is imminent, and there is more interest in what we do and say. It is very difficult to explain to these journalists – for example the reporter from Rutland Radio who will reach the humble punter in Oakham – why between 5% and 8% of the Commission's budget goes missing through fraud, mismanagement and waste each year.</p>
<p class="contents">How can one explain to the readers of the Lincolnshire Echo why it is that the accounts have been not been signed off by the European Court of Auditors? These are flawed accounts, there are problems in them and I certainly will not be voting for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Eurostat issue is by no means over and done with and we clearly still have a great deal to see, learn and do about this matter. I feel sure that the next Parliament will see this through to the very end, because the matter does not only involve Eurostat – it has many other strands too, because many other Commission departments were involved. This Parliament, I feel certain, will ensure that the serious mistakes and anomalies detected in that institution will be corrected. It is something else altogether, however, to pursue an electoral agenda and, as Mr Heaton-Harris has reminded us: elections will take place in two months and, as a result, some people are attempting, when it is neither the time nor the place to do so, to indulge in demagogy in order to gain an advantage in the elections.

It is perfectly possible to have responsibility without being to blame. With our motion of censure, we do not wish to apportion blame for the Eurostat scandal to Mr Solbes or any other Commissioner. We merely insist that the Commission itself apportion responsibility. The person responsible can then explain what he has done to apportion blame and to prevent any repetition. We can then take note of any explanation. It is as simple as that. We have no desire to see particular heads on a plate. It is, however, completely unacceptable for the Commissioner who has formal responsibility to come to us and say, ‘I am not responsible, because I did not know what was happening.’ The implication of Mr Solbes’ answer to us is that all the Commissioners will be free from responsibility and will instruct their colleagues not to bring anything near their desks. I should like to see who dares vote in favour of that logic.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does not recognise the EU’s accounts for the year in which chief accounting officer Marta Andreasen was suspended. In 1997, the recognised accountancy firm, Lloyd, estimated annual fraud at eight billion euros. Since then, we have seen fewer cases, but there are larger amounts involved. The figures may be much worse, since there is no supervisory authority with a complete overview. The Court of Auditors cannot obtain all the documents, the Ombudsman is not entitled to see everything and the Committee on Budgetary Control only receives superficial information. As a Member of this Parliament for 25 years, I have requested basic information concerning the use of EU funds and never obtained serious answers, for example about the distribution of agricultural aid or the number of working parties and their participants. There is only one language that the top officials in the Commission’s numerous fiefdoms understand. If we refuse to approve the accounts, Mr Prodi and his colleagues will have the opportunity to put their own house in order. At present, they are merely prisoners of bad habits going back decades. We should free them, reject the accounts and say where political accountability lies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She repeated the question as to how we guarantee that nothing like what happened with Eurostat can recur, and that is the essential issue. The Eurostat case showed just how important are the measures taken by the Commission as part of its reforms, such as the rotation of directors-general. As the Court of Auditors expressed it, the fiefdom culture must go; instead, the same standards must apply everywhere. There are numerous provisions in the Financial Regulation to ensure that nothing of the kind can happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also taken appropriate action to deal with the other issue, that of how we can ensure that, in the event of something happening, the flow of information does not malfunction in the way it did with Eurostat. We have laid down very definite rules to the effect that the Commissioners must be informed when their DGs are being audited or investigated by OLAF or by the internal audit department, so that it is impossible for someone not to be kept up to date. The proposal for an amendment to the OLAF Regulation serves to make it clear that the competent Commissioners must be provided with information as and when OLAF is engaged in an investigation or when a case is open.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than reiterate that we have indeed learned our lessons from the Eurostat case. Mr Prodi, on two occasions, came to this House in order to set out the action we were taking, making commitments to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, and those commitments we have met.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take this opportunity to thank you again for this debate, for the excellent report, and, overall, for the in-depth cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control over recent years, which, though critical, has been constructive. My warm thanks to you, many times over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a start, Mr Bonde, I always allow something like an extra 10% speaking time. If someone has three minutes, that simply adds up to a bit more than is the case with the speaking time allotted to you. You have not been treated unfairly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say, on a personal level, that I very much regret the fact that the star counsel for the European taxpayer, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, is absent from tonight's debate, at which there is work for him to do. I very much miss him.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the Commission's statement, I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">Voting on the reports will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.</p>
