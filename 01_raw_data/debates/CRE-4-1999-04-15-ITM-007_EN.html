Normally it is indeed a pleasure when you have a report on the agenda, but no rapporteur likes to have the mixed feelings that I am experiencing at the moment because of the annoying stalemate in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Two months ago, we had another debate on combined transport here in the Chamber. The vote which followed confirmed that the European Parliament could not agree to the Commission"s proposal to exempt combined transport from the generally accepted 40‐tonne weight limit. As a result, the proposal was referred back to the Committee on Transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly afterwards there were consultations between members of the Transport Committee and representatives of the Commission, and after a subsequent discussion in the committee I concluded that the majority were still in favour of maintaining the position adopted two months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Formally speaking this is the correct line to take, since the Commission has not come up with any new or amended proposals since Parliament rejected its original one. So in formal terms, there is no reason for Parliament to revise its position of two months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as rapporteur I can tell you that the Commission has not just been sitting on its hands. Both in its consultations with Parliament"s representatives and at the Transport Committee meeting, it indicated that it was prepared to re‐examine those sections on which Parliament had insurmountable objections. Because of the limited time available, it has not been able to produce any proposals on paper, but it has become clear that the Commission is favourably disposed and appears prepared to take Parliament"s objections on board and amend the current proposal accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">According to my information, there is also almost unanimous support in the Council for increasing the maximum weight. Only the United Kingdom appears to oppose this, but if there is an exemption for islands it should be able to benefit from this in view of its island status.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the present circumstances, it is difficult for me to vote for or against the resolution by the Transport Committee. I would not vote against because the situation has changed since two months ago, but I also would not vote in favour because the Commission"s approach deserves a better response than for Parliament simply to dig in its heels. I have to say, therefore, that I find it difficult to understand the hard line that some of my colleagues are pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is no doubt that we can find a way out of this impasse through negotiation, but as rapporteur I had no choice but to represent the view of the majority in the Committee on Transport. I would urge them to keep an open mind on the Council"s position and the Commission"s amendments, and I am confident that this issue can be brought to a successful conclusion which is acceptable to all parties at the start of the new parliamentary term.</p>

Unfortunately, I believe – and I am not the first to say this – that we have the classic case here in which a principle that we welcome and support, namely combined transport, in other words the effort to shift traffic away from the roads and onto the railways and waterways, has been dealt a severe blow by a single inappropriate measure. That was the criticism last time and, sad to say, nothing has changed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it makes any sense to create a rule which virtually makes every ban on Sunday and night haulage negotiable. Nor does it make any more sense to allow a 44‐tonne weight limit without any other restrictions at all. We have criticised this several times. We rejected it here in Parliament. The Council, for its part, did not take up Parliament"s proposal on the inclusion of tax incentives to promote combined transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we rejected this on the last occasion. The Commission has had the opportunity to make changes, as Mr van Dam rightly said, because it is after all the initiator of the legislative process and can revise its own proposals. We in Parliament made our position perfectly clear. We said we rejected this blanket solution and asked the Commission to come back with concrete proposals involving tighter rules. And I have to say to the Commissioner, even if he is not here at the moment, that sending a letter to the committee is not a proposal. It is not enough! I shall make no bones about this: a letter does not suffice as notice of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we await a more concrete set of proposals from the Commission. I believe Parliament is disposed to support the principle of combined transport. But if no proposals are forthcoming, we can do nothing. For that reason, we can only endorse the concluding words of the report: ‘… rejects the Commission proposal and calls on the Commission to withdraw its proposal'. That is the position. There is nothing else we can do at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may be slightly incapacitated because of the current situation, but we hope that it will be able, as soon as possible after the start of the next legislative term, to present some reasonable proposals that we can discuss. That would enable us to see this business through quite quickly, and there will be no need for us to make full use of our speaking time, because this issue practically generates its own momentum.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wijsenbeek </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the van Dam report, previously the Wijsenbeek report, is running the risk of becoming another Tolman report on isoglucose, in other words an institutional first. First of all, Parliament and the Commission originally had diametrically opposite views on this issue, and I have to say that when I was rapporteur, I entirely agreed with the Commission. Now we have to find a solution. If it is held over until after the elections, it will come under the codecision procedure. But what is doubly remarkable is that under a heading which does not exist in the Treaties, a current affairs issue on which Parliament and the Commission have opposing views, Mr Kinnock, should have come before the Council unamended. If it were not for the fact that there was no question at all of unanimity in the Council, not even unanimity minus one, then the Council might well have agreed with the Commission and might have accepted the decision, despite Parliament"s very different views.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel it is time to try to find some common solutions calmly, quietly and through consultation. As Mr Piecyk said, we agree that combined transport needs to be promoted and that greater use must be made of the inland waterways and railways. It seems that all we disagree on are those few tonnes, although we all know how much discussion there has been on excess weight and how many exceptions have been agreed over the weekend. We have to find a middle ground here.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maes </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I am by no means an expert on road transport, but I have to say that I agree with the previous speaker, Mr Wijsenbeek, because I have heard some terrible complaints from people who are not just professionally involved with road transport but work with it every day. How can Europe claim to champion the free movement of goods when the axle weights of lorries are different in the Netherlands, Belgium and France? The permitted weight per axle is different again, so that a lorry travelling through three European countries will either be breaking the law somewhere or else running itself into the ground financially. Moreover, if it has unloaded half its load, it will no longer be complying with the requirements that it met when it started out. Not to mention the rules on Sunday and holiday driving, which are also completely different.</p>
<p class="contents">I live in a country where the volume of freight transport is extremely heavy. I know that lorries are allowed to drive around quite happily in Belgium, for example, whereas the same might not be true in neighbouring countries. I ask you, is this what Europe is all about? Is this all we have to show for our much‐vaunted cooperation and coordination? I have to say that European hauliers have quite enough to worry about when you think that, for example, Portuguese haulage companies drive goods round our countries at prices that are far below the average which our hauliers have to pay their workers. The same could be said of British haulage companies. So as you will gather, I support all calls for genuine coordination and I will find it hard to justify myself to voters in the forthcoming elections who confront me with issues such as this to which I cannot give a proper answer.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Even though, the political circumstances being what they are, the present Commission is only supposed to be dealing with current affairs, in this particular case I am dealing with something ‘in transit" on behalf of Mr Kinnock. The discussions that have taken place with the rapporteur and other Members since the debate on the van Dam report, previously the Wijsenbeek report, at the February part‐session have convinced me, or rather Mr Kinnock, that we all agree on the need to make combined transport more attractive and competitive. We want to encourage a shift from road transport to other forms of transport that are more sustainable, safer and more energy‐efficient, while at the same time giving transport users more choice. As an important element of these joint efforts, the Commission is proposing to enable transport operators in the Community to use a maximum lorry weight of 44 tonnes, but only for road transport which forms part of a combined transport operation and only for the relatively short road legs of the combined transport journey.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this is not the only way to make this potentially important transport sector more competitive, but I want to make a significant contribution by improving the conditions under which the road legs of combined transport journeys are carried out, not least by reducing the often unreasonably high costs involved.</p>
<p class="contents">If we could reduce the costs by 10 % for heavy goods transport, it would be an important incentive for potential combined transport users. Experience in a number of Member States has shown this to be the case. Seven of the Member States already allow a weight of 44 tonnes or more for all road transport, while others allow 44 tonnes for part of a combined transport operation. As honourable Members are undoubtedly aware, the Member States can prescribe a maximum weight of 44 tonnes for three‐axle vehicles forming part of a five‐ or six‐axle combination to prevent such vehicles from causing too much damage to the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this proposal is not intended to give road transport an unfair advantage, quite the reverse. It is specifically designed to influence the behaviour of road transport operators by persuading them to use other forms of transport. The net result will be that a greater volume of goods will be transported by rail, inland waterway and short‐haul transport. As Mr Kinnock pointed out to Mr van Dam in his letter of 11 March, he genuinely believes that we need to translate the consensus we have achieved on the need to promote combined transport into specific, practical measures. In our view we need at this stage, as someone said earlier, to consider more restrictive weight rules for island Member States than those originally proposed by the Commission, for the obvious reason that their links with the rest of the market are not just by road.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it also makes sense to examine ways of determining whether a road journey genuinely forms part of a combined transport operation. On behalf of Mr Kinnock let me say – including to Mr Wijsenbeek – that I hope we can find universally acceptable solutions on the basis of compromise proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the rapporteur, Mr van Dam, for all their efforts on this very complicated subject.</p>
