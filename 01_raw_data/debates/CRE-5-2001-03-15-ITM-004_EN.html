<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Purvis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, we live in exciting times. In our own lifetimes there have been massive and amazing advances in science and technology. New industries have appeared, become commonplace, and have provided a better quality of life, higher standards of living, new and better jobs and better working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">For Europe to keep its position in the economic forefront globally and to provide the standards we have come to expect, it has been essential for us to grasp these new technologies. Biotechnology is yet another of these industries. We ignore or side-step it at our peril. Like all new technologies, there are bound to be concerns: environmental, ethical and safety concerns. They must be fully and very openly discussed and studied with the public; they must be monitored and safeguarded by effective regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as privacy and confidentiality in an era of genetic predictions require further study and perhaps specific legislation. We signal this need in the report and take no predetermined position. This is for later, after proper debate. I would suggest that Amendments Nos 9 and 27 are premature in that they seek to close off such consideration and decision. It is incumbent on us to encourage our scientists, entrepreneurs and business managers to take full advantage of the potential of biotechnology and bring this potential to the people of Europe and to the world, especially the less well-provided developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology – the life and plant sciences which it encompasses – offers major advances in medicines and health care, to prevent and cure diseases and disabilities which for so long have blighted the lives of so many men, women and children in our constituencies and world-wide. Biotechnology offers major advances in the production of food in Europe to the advantage of farmers and consumers alike and benefits those parts of the world which struggle against drought and saline soils and fast-increasing populations. It offers crops that eliminate vitamin A deficiency and blindness for millions. It will use fewer pesticides and herbicides and therefore improve the environment and natural habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">With valuable opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural and Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I sincerely thank their draftsmen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has considered all the implications and decisively calls for us in Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to give this industry the support and commitment which it deserves and so badly needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Following several years of reticence and indecision, we are well behind our main competitors in the USA. American R&amp;D expenditure on biotechnology is three-and-a-half times that of Europe, employment is over three times and biotech revenues four times.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the USA: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, Thailand, Singapore are all embracing biotechnology and actively promoting their indigenous industries. There is no time to lose if Europe is to take its proper place. We have the scientists, the research establishments and the scientific capability. We have the basis of a successful industry, with entrepreneurs, investors and business managers. But, for too long, these have been discouraged by negative and sceptical attitudes in government and political circles, public opinion and the media, by unsympathetic fiscal regimes, by a risk-averse culture and cumbersome legal structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Council promised to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Now we look to the Stockholm Council to fulfil that promise on biotechnology, which is precisely one of the most important means for reaching that much-quoted target. We look to the Commission to rouse itself, to shed its reticence and give a resolute lead with a bio-Europe action plan. We look to the Member States to get on with the job of implementing the outstanding directives and providing the positive environment for their biotech industries to develop and prosper. Our scientists and entrepreneurs are watching intently. What happens here today, in Stockholm this month, in Brussels and the Member States in the next few months, will decide whether they emigrate elsewhere or seek their futures here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask my colleagues in Parliament to give this report their full support. I ask the Commission to respond to it with vigour, determination and singleness of purpose.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wish to take into consideration the principle of safety when it comes to consumers, the work of farmers, and the whole food processing chain. Our first message is that biotechnology is one way of developing agriculture, which is now struggling with problems. It offers opportunities for the production of non-food goods, such as new biofuels, plastics, and so on. It offers opportunities for using fewer pesticides and having a positive impact on the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">What is essential for farmers is that they should derive some financial benefit when the new technology is introduced. That has not happened in the United States with regard to what are called first generation genetically modified products. The European aim must be to improve the financial position of farmers by achieving better quality and efficiency through the use of technology. Biotechnology could have immense importance for regional policy. It offers opportunities for regions where natural conditions are harsh. This also applies to the situation in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there are dangers associated with new technology, which are worth bearing in mind as early on as possible in any decision-making policy of the EU. Farmers may become dependent on large, multinational companies in the processing industry. To prevent the concentration of development, the EU must guarantee there are adequate public resources available for research, and support research and development in small biotechnological enterprises and plant-breeding institutes. It will be very important to guarantee competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee is satisfied with the work of Mr Purvis and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as our amendments were taken account of at the committee stage. We would hope that the Commission will read carefully those requests that appear in the report <span class="italic">inter alia </span>to measure the net impact on the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is probably most obvious of all within the medical sphere, but there are also opportunities in a number of other fields. However, biotechnology also raises a series of new and very difficult issues to which we must respond. These include ethical issues within the medical sphere, environmental and consumer issues in connection with the cultivation of genetically modified crops and global issues of justice in connection with patent rights and the dominance of the industry by large multinational corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues must be taken very seriously if a credible overall policy is to be drawn up in this area. The opinion of the Committee on the Environment indicates some key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Patent law must respect the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity which establishes developing countries' – indeed, all countries' – right to their genetic heritage. There must be strong, independent and open public research in the field so that there is also research into areas which are not of immediate commercial interest and into the problems and risks posed by the technology. There must also be public control of the research.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the controversial issue of the cultivation of genetically modified crops is concerned, it has to be appreciated that the adoption of Directive 90/220/EEC does not mean that there is at present adequate legislation in this area. We still do not have the necessary regulations on labelling, traceability and responsibility. Such regulations must be a precondition for considering whether to embark upon the large-scale commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we would point out the risks of genetic confidentiality not being respected and of genetic profiling being misused, for example to refuse people jobs or insurance. That would lead, of course, to an increase in social inequality. We think it crucial that problems of this kind, too, should also be clarified, precisely so that the positive potential of biotechnology can be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has presented a remarkable report and drawn attention to the great potential of biotechnology. We note that biotechnology is unable to develop that great potential particularly well in Europe. There are a number of hindrances to it in the European Union. The greatest one in my opinion is the de facto moratorium on the release of genetically modified organisms. We do not investigate which plants or organisms are particularly dangerous and therefore should perhaps not be approved; instead we do not approve any at all and no distinction is made between different organisms. This arrangement was a problem from the start. There was never a proper basis for it in law, and now it is even more of a problem because the Council and Parliament have adopted new rules for the release of genetically modified organisms, and I cannot understand why some Member States still do not want to end the moratorium. It is particularly harmful to small and medium-sized enterprises that are unable to transfer their work abroad. We have good rules for release and we can therefore end the moratorium now.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the dangers of green gene technology are much overstated. I also believe the prospects for medicinal use are overstated, that things are being painted in black and white – genetic changes in farming are bad, in medicine they are per se good. I think there are opportunities and risks in both, and that is also what the report says in item 32. Now that we have good rules for plants, we also need good common rules in medicine. There is room for improvement there.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must set ethically-based limits for gene technology and biotechnology. We have already gone some way towards that in Europe and there is now a Committee on Human Genetics that must look particularly at this area again, because Europe is a community of values. This does not mean that we have to have the same laws everywhere, that we harmonise everything, but we must agree in Europe, too, on certain basic principles and I would like to press for that strongly.</p>

Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists. It is not only a question of living better, we have to be fitter so that older people can continue by their work to contribute to the wealth of society. Long life and a healthy life have to be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that in plant, animal and human biology lie the biggest challenges of the 21st century. I very strongly support that section of the report which calls for more concrete proposals for action from the Commission and Council. We need the Commission to report on the present state of the industry and the comparisons between Member States and to give us better data for future action. The development of a plan for a bio-Europe – paralleling the e-Europe – for activities of the Commission and Member States to make the Union a competitor for the biotechnology industry is a worthy aim. The Council should also commit to biotechnology as a key new technology and the Stockholm Summit would be a useful time for them to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">The region that I represent has the lowest GDP per head of any region in the United Kingdom. It is not a comfortable position and one of the key developments in the regional economic planning is to support a company to stimulate growth in biotechnology industries. We call it Bio-Science-North. The aim is to draw on research in university departments, to establish incubator companies and stimulate growth in those that are already established. We believe that this is one of the most important instruments that we have been able to put in place in the last two or three years, with of course support from the European Regional Development Fund. I know that our region is not alone in that but I believe that this is something that all regions in the Community should be examining.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I would like to make is that we must reinforce the environmental possibilities of biotechnology. It should be recognised that it gives us tremendous opportunities for tackling pollution and reducing resource depletion and gives us opportunities in the food sector to improve the output from our agricultural industries. I hope that the biotechnology industry will get a tremendous boost from the adoption of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason we shall support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 25 and 27.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology, along with information and communications technology, is among the most promising technologies of the twenty-first century; in the years ahead these sectors will provide much new employment worldwide. A precondition for this will be that the European Union develops a transparent and innovation-promoting regulatory framework, as well as an encouraging entrepreneurial climate. Up to now, the biotechnology sector has been the lame duck as regards legislation facilitating economic support. Consequently, I welcome the Anglo-Dutch initiative to make biotechnology a key priority on the Stockholm agenda. If the European Union wishes to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy, it is now time to create a <span class="italic">‘B-Europe’ </span>alongside an<span class="italic"> ‘E-Europe’</span>. I am glad that the Dutch Prime Minister has realised this. Perhaps he can also persuade his party in the Netherlands parliament to withdraw its appeal to the European Court of Justice against the directive protecting biotechnological inventions. Because without sound patent legislation there will be no new investment by companies, no biotech start-ups and hence no innovation or employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that our Commissioner will inform Parliament speedily about the Stockholm summit and what has been decided there with regard to biotechnology. Perhaps he could suggest changing the acronym GMO to GEM, genetically enhanced materials, since ‘gems are precious stones’, and that is what biotechnology must become in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will say this: Mr Purvis is right about one thing. Biotechnological applications will develop rapidly in the next few years. But we do not need everything that industry would like to see for that to happen, such as patenting genes that already exist in nature, the free trade in manipulated genes, tax concessions for stock options for companies and their directors, the liberalisation of product labelling, subjective information, and the handling of biotechnology as an exclusively industrial operation, for which the EU’s Directorate-General for Enterprise in the has responsibility. Mr Purvis’s report contains many views that point in this direction, and our group cannot, therefore accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to see biotechnology as an opportunity that will open up new dimensions in science. The manipulation of nature must be approached in a more careful way than that which Mr Purvis is proposing. We have to set aside time to examine all the effects of unborn - and possibly unheard-of in nature - species and varieties on people and the rest of nature. We support the development of biotechnology and research in the field must not, for example, be allowed to be trampled on by information technology. The IT stock market bubble has now burst. We do not want biotechnology to become another such bubble, built of false expectations and empty promises.</p>

Based on a one-sided industry-oriented approach he calls on us to support the biotechnology industry. That is understandable from his perspective, in which the aim of Europe is to create wealth and employment. However, I have a number of peripheral comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sign in the report of a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of biotechnology. The rapporteur calls the development of biotechnology good for the environment, the quality of food, health and the developing countries. However, it is very doubtful whether the developing countries will benefit. Probably they will become more dependent on the mainly Western suppliers of seed and pesticides. After all, food provision, besides being a problem of technological and biological shortcomings, is mainly a distribution issue. Unfortunately, the rapporteur imputes an exemplary function to the United States. Biotechnological agriculture there announced that it can no longer guarantee that its products are GMO-free because of cross-pollination.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on biotechnology should also reflect an even-handed balance. Leaving it to the sector leads to an entanglement of ethics and economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethical decisions should be taken as close as possible to the level of the citizen. That also applies to the direction of development in biotechnology. The report, on the other hand, instructs the Member States even on financial support, tax measures, education and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is premature for the rapporteur to call upon Member States to agree with a patent on life, to which there are ethical and legal objections, such as conflict with international treaties. The Netherlands and Great Britain have appealed to the Court and it is better to wait for the judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives responsibility for authorising GMOs to the European Food Authority. However, the latter has only an advisory function. Politicians remain responsible for the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Policy for the biotechnology industry in the European Union should be based on the views of the Member States. In the light of this poor coordination, it is telling that this report should appear before the temporary Committee on Human Genetics has reported on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, it is odd that Europe, usually averse to state aid, should be calling upon the Member States to support an industrial sector. It is unclear for what reason this industrial sector deserves to receive support.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage it would have been better if the report had been restricted to cross-border industrial aspects, such as development barriers or a survey of options within the various possible policy directions, without simply advocating support.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the above misgivings, I am unable to support the report. Economic motives must not dominate moral considerations. Europe, which claims to be a community of values, should show greater sensibility in dealing with this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an intelligent, integrated operation which interpreted and respected the different stances of the members of the committee, including their ethical concerns. For my part, as a scientist, I greatly welcome both the specific intrinsic value of the report, which, at last, places Europe on a level with the countries which invest more in scientific research, and the new horizons which are appearing in the fight to eradicate terrible diseases such as certain neurodegenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the agrifoods sector, the adoption of my amendment, which stipulates that genetically modified foods must be subject to obligatory mutagenisis, carcinogenesis and toxicity tests before they are placed on the market, will go some way towards restoring the citizens’ confidence at last, especially their faith in the institutions and the political world. I would like to thank John Purvis once again for consenting to the adoption of a number of amendments I tabled, which seek to ensure that our human resources are properly valued and enhanced, particularly young researchers, and that young researchers are offered attractive career prospects which are on a level with those offered by the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I feel that the Purvis report can be considered a valuable contribution to that complex, diverse mosaic which is the European Research Area, which, together with Mr Busquin and Mr Liikanen, we are doing an excellent job of establishing in Europe and which will make us competitive and enable us to take up this world challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight. Such things exist. We could imitate it. It would transform our energy industry completely. To understand that, for example, is an enormous challenge. Or look at a sea urchin’s spine under the microscope. You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built. To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture. We will only understand it if we are curious enough to find out, if we approach new technology, new science with curiosity and not with fear. That is John Purvis’ message and I would like to endorse it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as regards developing countries I would like to point out that there is one developing country that has made enormous strides in biotechnology. That is Cuba. For 40 years, Cuba has been investing in biotechnology like hardly any other country and today has a turnover in modern biotechnology of well over USD 100 million. I only want to mention that because other countries are named here. Despite all the criticism that can be levelled at Cuba in other respects, I think that is a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics. No living creature operates according to conventional thermodynamics, otherwise we would not live as long as we do. Irreversible thermodynamics, small changes, will perhaps show us a completely new way forward in energy. That is also something we need to understand. Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration. I think we should be showing a little more courage with this technology, paying attention to the risks of course, but there has never been any progress made without curiosity or courage, and the same applies for biotechnology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time or more or less at the same time, Heads of Government Tony Blair and Wim Kok sent a joint letter to the Swedish President of the Council calling for an economic action plan to promote the European biotechnology industry and giving due emphasis to that call with a raft of suggested measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese has already said that we are dealing with other issues besides economic matters, and as a Parliament we shall be following all these actions closely. It is an important, essential prerequisite for the success of this action plan that all decisions should be taken on the basis of the best information available. We are therefore particularly anxious that full use should be made of the various advisory and scientific committees through which scientific and economic expertise is fed into the preparation and taking of decisions. I therefore most especially welcome the report’s call for greater use to be made of all these committees and would like to call on the Commission to make greater use than before of all the possibilities for consultation and groundwork, as we should do, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I hear what some Members have to say, or when I read certain passages in the report, I am stunned and astounded. World hunger, unexpected climate change, protection of the environment, all these problems could be resolved tomorrow thanks to the benefits of biotechnology. I think that it would be just as naïve to simply disregard the possible risks, excesses and abuses, all the more so because we are already seeing some of them taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks and excesses could either be curbed or increased depending on developments in legislation both in the European Union and internationally. I would like to make just two points. The first relates to drug patenting. We are now seeing the problems of access to generic drugs to combat AIDS in the African nations, Brazil and countries in Asia. Given the pharmaceutical industry’s propensity for the use of biotechnology in future drugs, I think that this problem will only grow worse and that we will therefore have to ensure that patent legislation does not prevent production and parallel imports of generic drugs to combat great scourges and serious diseases, which threaten the poorest nations.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries. I think that a clear distinction must certainly be made between patents on inventions and patents on discoveries, especially since biological riches are concentrated in the countries of the South, in tropical areas, because, otherwise, we will once again see the countries of the South being plundered so that major laboratories of industrialised nations can benefit. In any case, we must put an end to the ‘patenting of life forms’.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which will bring me to my conclusion, is that I believe fundamental decisions, particularly on releasing GMOs, must continue to come under political responsibility. The European Food Safety Authority will most probably play a crucial role in providing expertise, information and recommendations, but it is the competent authorities which must, on a political level, continue to authorise the release of GMOs. As long as problems such as traceability, labelling and determining responsibility for damage persist and as long as we have no guarantees on risks, I believe that we are justified in continuing the moratorium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments. However, by almost exclusively falling into line with the approach of biotechnology companies, and by giving priority to economic and technological aspects, the report pays minimal attention to the major questions of ethics and safety, which are giving the general public so much concern.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that the biotechnology industry, seen from a strictly industrial and mercantile point of view, will make all these problems worse; for example, unfair trade, environmental disasters, industrial mergers and unemployment and the increasing power of multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, therefore, find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced. It disregards the concerns that were even expressed in this House on GMOs. It questions the moratorium imposed by several Member States, one of which was France. I agree with what my fellow Member has just said. I think that, given all the problems we face – and since I heard you mention courage earlier – it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation. While I do, therefore, acknowledge the advantages of biotechnologies, I cannot support the report as it stands. I hope that it will be amended, particularly in the light of the conclusions of the Sjöstedt report, which is, in the main, based on respect for the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Sixth Framework Research Programme, the Commission made biotechnology and genetic engineering priority areas. It is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001. I call on the Commission to do all it can to take full advantage of the contribution that biotechnology can make to economic growth and to the protection of the environment, but also to take full account of ethical, environmental and social issues, which I believe require dialogue between politicians, scientists and citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world and threatens to miss opportunities. The causes are mainly a fairly weak strategic vision, laborious approval procedures and non-transparent coordination between European and national legislation. The great value of this report is that it clearly describes where additional guarantees are required for producers, consumers, environment and health care. In that respect the report stands in a number of areas in glaring contrast to the letter addressed by the British and Dutch prime ministers Blair and Kok to the European Council. This letter is too bogged down in rather hollow rhetoric on opportunities, whereas Purvis rightly speaks up for the small and medium-sized business that is so important to Europe. In that respect, the government of my country has depressing examples of a zigzag policy, as was shown, for example, only last year in relation to the use of GM potatoes for non-food production.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the FAO has calculated that world food production will have to increase by two-and-a-half times in twenty years, and that there is insufficient scope for opening up new agricultural areas in the world. And those who, like the present Minister for Agriculture in Germany, Mrs Künast, retreat into small-scale production and organic farming, are in fact turning their backs on international society. A good balance between new techniques such as biotechnology, sustainability and their accommodation within a strategic food policy is indispensable. As far as that is concerned, a strong European food authority with supervisory and monitoring powers is in fact also indispensable for such policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must say that with his report the honourable Member has taken an excellent first step towards a new discussion in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Purvis makes clear, it is a vital industry for the future of the European Union. It will provide jobs and opportunities for innovation with new products and new processes in such fields as agriculture, medicine and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Fifth Framework Programme we are already putting EUR 2 billion into the biotechnology industry and I hope that in the Sixth Framework Programme that will increase. But despite all that we are behind the United States, which dominates the biotechnology market in terms of revenue, R and D expenditure and even number of employees. It is between three and four times bigger than the industry in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to benefit from the biotechnology industry, we need to nurture the industry. We need to invest through the Sixth Framework Programme and other R and D funds. Balanced regulation is important. It is clear there has been a public loss of confidence in science and technology, scientists and engineers. The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises indicate a lack of confidence. It is also clear that there is an ethical dimension. We need public accountability and clear guidelines that command public support. In terms of research and genetic manipulation, many of us would support somatic cell repair but might have doubts about somatic cell enhancement or germ cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about germ-cell enhancement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for insurance companies to refuse cover on the basis of genetic profiling or for manufacturing companies to recruit those with a low propensity to cancer for dirty jobs. We need to strike a balance between introducing regulations that will allow the biotechnology industry to thrive in the future and maintaining public confidence. Otherwise public concerns may well drive economic activity across the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Genetic engineering applications will play a key role. I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely. In the last legislative term I drew attention to the importance of genetic engineering in my report on genetic engineering and its impact on agriculture. We must now at last give the green light to green genetic engineering. To stick with this theme of colours, consumers have long since given the green light to red genetic engineering, i.e. the application of genetic engineering in medicine. The advantages are tangible and easy to understand. In green genetic engineering, its application in agriculture, consumers are, as I say, sadly still showing the red light.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also show the red card to extremists. Biotechnology and gene technology must cease to be the poor relation. The EU must get on board the moving train of research and application or it will leave without us. I am worried by the trend of more and more small and medium-sized enterprises pulling out of green biotechnology and gene technology. The present EU moratorium means that while research is taking place the subsequent application of the product is not being allowed in individual countries. Undertakings, and with them jobs, are leaving Europe. In my view, the lights are on amber here. They must be allowed to change to green.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, whether we are talking about red or green genetic engineering, the ethical bounds to biotechnology and gene technology must be clearly formulated. I would like to say to the opponents of research that we have a moral obligation to use the opportunities this new technology offers for medicine and for caring for the world population as a whole. The public will give the green light to biotechnology and gene technology only if they have information and transparency with clearly marked out ethical bounds. I also appeal to industry to do their part in helping us with the public relations work so that acceptance will increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report. We can only welcome it as a recognition of the economic, social and environmental impact of biotechnology. Biotechnology has a very important role to play in fulfilling the commitment made by the Lisbon European Council to develop a competitive, knowledge-based economy. That is also the basis for creating employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already indicated the priority it attaches to biotechnology in its proposal for the next research framework programme. Therefore we share the report's view on the need to promote a competitive European biotechnology industry. A study on the position of the European biotechnology industry should be ready later this spring, and I shall make that available to Parliament. Further, let me say how much the Commission appreciates the report's particular merit of taking a comprehensive view on all major issues related to biotechnology. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this successful attempt.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the Stockholm European Council, which takes place next week, the Commission underlines the importance of biotechnology as a frontier technology for growth and employment, and as a tool for sustainable development. The Commission also announces a broad policy paper setting up a strategic vision for life sciences and biotechnology after 2010, which will be ready by the end of this year. The policy paper and action plan will be the Commission's response to Parliament's wish for an initiative. Obviously, in preparing this policy document we can now carefully take into account the views of the European Parliament as expressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say that we need a broad debate on the ethical and societal impacts of the issue. If and when we want to promote the biotechnology industry and its possibilities, we must always be open about it, otherwise we will not be successful. We will also base our report on the indications from the Industry Ministers’ informal meetings on 16 February and possible indications from the European Council next week. I expect the European Council will take a very strong position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that we will have to build on expertise in many fields, as well as consulting a wide range of stake-holders. We need to hold discussions with a wide range of people: scientists, experts and citizens. There are no simple answers to the needs and questions raised by biotechnology, but it is the Commission's intention to provide – with you – a considered and comprehensive strategy before the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once this person has received the answer he can do what he likes with it, and can therefore give it to the media, and what is more, I would say that it is his duty to do so. These, Mr Barón Crespo, are the rules of democracy. But as you like receiving documentation, please, Madam President, send him the regulations governing this event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
