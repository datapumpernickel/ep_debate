It was a treaty which would make it possible for an independent court to judge people who had committed war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately, we know that there is a great need for such a criminal court. Ninety States signed the Rome treaty, but so far only <span class="italic">six</span> countries have ratified it. That is precisely the problem. If we are to progress further and if the Court is really to be able to begin its work, then at least sixty countries must ratify the treaty and hand this over to the UN. </p>
<p class="contents">We must all work towards the goal of obtaining a functioning court within a few years. My group urges the Council and the Commission to do their utmost, politically and diplomatically, to bring this about. At the same time, one ought not to forget the applicant countries which I believe require a lot of support if they are to be able to be involved in this. Paragraph 5 of the resolution is, furthermore, a very important paragraph indeed when it says that the developing countries must be given economic aid if it is to be possible for them to be involved in the process of establishing a criminal court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 for the protection of victims of armed conflicts already oblige States to pursue and try the perpetrators of such crimes. The plan for an international criminal court is another step forward in the creation of an international humanitarian legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded here that the preparation period for the statute of the international criminal court was long and tense. I had the honour of participating in that process on behalf of the world parliamentary community in my capacity as the then President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I can therefore bear witness to the fact that, in that very complicated negotiation, many concessions had to be made in order to draw up a text which, although falling short of our initial aspirations, achieved the necessary consensus and was finally able to come into play as an acceptably effective instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be irresponsible today not to publicly recognise our disappointment at the fact that, a year and a half later, only 91 States have signed it and just five or six have ratified it when – as Mrs Schörling has said – 60 ratifications are necessary for the court to come into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, by means of the resolution we are about to approve, the European Parliament is coherently maintaining the support which it always expressed for this initiative. However, to sum up, what we are going to do here in these final debates of the year and the century is to publicly and formally recognise that this issue is still outstanding, and that we also have the commitment to persevere with our efforts to fulfil the objective which we set on approving the court’s statute, also urging the Council and the Commission to act to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these actions, we Socialists are guided by the awareness that, in a world which is being globalised, it is essential that the Rule of Law is globalised as well and this is what we should work towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am especially pleased that Commissioner Verheugen is here today and hope that he can use his influence to ensure that we have the applicant countries, as well as other countries which want to cooperate, alongside us on this issue and that we obtain a significant number of ratifications. It is also a shame that we are forced to note that only six Member States have signed this treaty. If, however, we involve more Member States, applicant countries and cooperating States in this work, then we shall make some progress along the road. The destination is certainly a compromise, but we have to start somewhere. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I hope that we can work for those resources which are needed if the treaty is to be able to function. This, I believe, will be an important priority for us in this Chamber in the future. I also hope that, in the future too, Members of the European Parliament will have the opportunity to be involved in working parties, as we were at an earlier stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a legal instrument to guarantee this reconciliation. We know that reconciliation is only possible if justice is done. This insight helps form the basis for the international tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia: do justice, not as a victor but from a supra-national viewpoint and with a view to living together in future. Our group, therefore, warmly welcomes the fact that an international court has now been set up with a more universal authority which complements national courts where they fall short. Member States and candidate countries of the European Union should, of course, lead the way. This includes the thirteenth candidate country, Mr President, Turkey. One can hardly suppress a smile if one talks about Turkey in this context. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and Council succeed in exerting pressure on other countries in order to achieve ratification of the EC Treaty. Financial support is needed to enable poor countries to take part in these court activities. This will play an important preventative role, irrespective of political considerations of an amoral nature and immune to political blackmail. Big criminals can no longer expect that their crimes will go unpunished. The Milosevices, the Karadices, the Mladices of this world, they will know. The international criminal court constitutes a breakthrough in politics. It confirms that politics is not a question of power where legislation serves to cover our embarrassment, but quite the opposite, that the central role of politics is to create legislation where power is of benefit. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this Parliament will need to be acutely aware of this, also with regard to the most recent debate on Nicaragua. It is downright scandalous if matters which are totally unacceptable in terms of human rights are covered up out of party-political considerations. Mr President, I hope that this Parliament and the groups which, based on their own convictions, can muster a better position, will take a clearer stance in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does not mean that others should not do theirs, it means that we must ensure as a matter of urgency that this criminal court is up and running soon.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two reasons for this. The first reason is prevention. I was at a conference held by our group a few days ago in Banja Luka. There was much to see that was encouraging, such as the Serbian opposition, which has got off to an auspicious start. However, I also met a man who sat trembling with fear as he related all the crimes which he had committed in this period in the Republic of Srpska. I found the conversation extremely interesting because it more or less proved that, if he had known that he might appear before an international criminal court, he might perhaps have behaved differently.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this preventative aspect is tremendously important, not on account of the criminals at the top, those who possess criminal energy which transcends everything, but on account of the criminals at second or third remove who must know that, in the end, they cannot escape punishment for their crimes, even if they considered themselves as temporary vicarious agents of very powerful figures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this criminal court is important for prevention, but it is also essential for another reason. Right is right and wrong is wrong, irrespective of who has committed it, and the problem facing specific criminal courts is that they are always a little on the lookout for triumphant justice. It is therefore extremely important for there to be a uniform criminal law against genocide and crimes against humanity throughout the world and for there to be uniform sentences and a common criminal court throughout the world, where everyone knows that wrong is always wrong and must be prosecuted, irrespective of the charge, irrespective of the ideology and irrespective of the nationality under which they appear in court. Injustice is still injustice and injustice must not go unpunished. This will avoid a situation in which the one-eyed is king and will help the concept of the law on which the European Union is founded to take hold throughout the world. That is why action on this criminal court is one of the most important tasks facing the European Union in the immediate future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes the fact that more and more contracting parties are signing the statute decided in Rome and that some at least have already ratified it. However, to be fair, we should point out that, in numerous cases the constitutions of some signatory States, including some Member States, prohibit the extradition of their own citizens and constitutional amendments are therefore needed before this agreement can be ratified. This applies, for example, to Germany and that is the reason for the delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I am more than willing, Mrs Thors, to bring applicant countries’ attention to the need for them to sign and ratify this agreement, but I think that Mr Posselt was right when he said that my position on this matter would be more credible if all 15 had already ratified it. Ratification and proper transposition of the Rome statute into national law is an important task. The EU is aware of the complex issues which surround it. I have already referred to the constitutional problems and we are prepared to share our experience with ratification procedures and the relevant know-how with interested states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the EU have already offered the other States financial and technical assistance in ratifying the statute and they stand by that offer. The Member States of the Union and the European Commission have also taken, or are supporting, a series of other initiatives to promote the statute. We also appreciate the important contribution made in this area by non-governmental organisations, who are devoting themselves to raising awareness of the Rome statute and its imminent ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union and the European Commission have proven their commitment to furthering international criminal justice by working closely with the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia and supporting them strongly. We are stepping up our willingness to examine how we can contribute to the future work of the international criminal court through cooperation, aid and support in all areas. The Commission shares the view put forward in the debate here that this criminal court will not, under any circumstances, have a purely symbolic significance but that it can have a direct, preventative effect and will help to ensure that perhaps the most horrific crimes will no longer be committed in the future.</p>
