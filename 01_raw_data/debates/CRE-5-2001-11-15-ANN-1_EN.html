<p>According to a report published in the New York Times before the terrorist strike of 11 September, the USA has launched a programme of secret research into biological weapons ‘which tests the limits of the global treaty banning such weapons’. Under the programme, variants of anthrax bacteria are being produced, experiments are being performed which focus on methods of producing biological weapons, and a factory for the preparation of deadly microbes has even been built in the Nevada desert.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of the facts referred to in the reports and how does it intend to intervene with the US authorities, particularly since these actions are in breach of the treaty banning such weapons and the undertaking made by the USA in 1969 to destroy its biological arsenal?

<p>1. The report to which the honourable Member refers has never been brought to the Council's attention. The United States of America is nonetheless party to the 'biological weapons' Convention and the Council has no reason to doubt that it adheres to this Convention's provisions.</p>
<p>2. All EU Member States are party to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and adhere to its provisions.</p>
<p>3. The strengthening of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) is a priority for the EU in the disarmament and non-proliferation field. The Council reiterates its position that the threat posed by biological weapons demands an appropriate multilateral response. It is desirable that the Fifth Review Conference (Geneva, 19 November - 6 December 2001) should be able to adopt decisions offering the prospect of rapid resumption of negotiations within the multilateral framework of the Convention with all States party to it taking part. The Council continues to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work on achieving a legally binding instrument.</p>
<p>The EU has taken note of the statement by the United States to the effect that it supports all the multilateral mechanisms currently in force which have as their aim the supervision, non-proliferation and control of arms exports, as well as taking note of their alternative proposals on biological weapons. The EU is in the process of studying these proposals, which we have already discussed with the Americans, and we will continue our discussions in the course of the preparations for the Review Conference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0852"></a>

<p>In response to the problems in the world shipbuilding market, particularly overcapacity and constantly falling prices, the European Commission and the Korean government engaged in discussions in March 2000 with the objective of promoting stability and fair competition in this market.</p>
<p>On 22 June 2000, the two parties concluded an agreement in the form of ‘Agreed Minutes’ on the world shipbuilding market. These minutes comprise, in particular, commitments aimed at avoiding unprofitable over-investment and price-cutting, as well as an agreement stipulating that ship prices must reflect all the factors in the cost. The minutes also provide for regular consultations between the two parties.</p>
<p>In November 2000, in view of Korea’s non-compliance with the terms of the Agreed Minutes, the Commission presented, for the Council's consideration at its meeting on 4 and 5 December 2000, a strategy on the basis of which it would negotiate with Korea with the aim of achieving a satisfactory agreement and, having reported back to the Council by 1 May 2001 at the latest on the stage that negotiations had reached by then, it would propose, if no negotiated solution had been achieved, to refer the matter to the WTO in order to have the unfair practices of the Koreans penalised. The Commission also agreed to propose, in that event, a temporary defensive mechanism with the specific object of countering the Koreans' unfair practices for as long as was necessary to complete the WTO process.</p>
<p>The Commission's 8 May 2001 position on shipbuilding was presented to the Council when it met on 14 and 15 May 2001. Despite the efforts made to negotiate with Korea, it has not been possible to come to an agreement. The Council was pleased with the Commission's intention to enter proceedings before the WTO should a satisfactory agreement with Korea not have been achieved by 30 June 2001 at the latest. The Council also took note of the Commission's intention to set up a temporary defensive mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>In a letter of 30 July 2001, the Commission communicated to the Council the proposal<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to which the honourable Member's question refers and which confirms that operational aid had not been effective in defending the Community’s shipyards against unfair international competition. For this reason, and in application of Article 3 of the Council regulation on aid to shipbuilding<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, operational aid was terminated with effect from the beginning of 2001.</p>
<p>The proposal provides for a temporary defensive mechanism in support of the steps taken by the Community with respect to Korea within the framework of the WTO. The mechanism becomes operational only after the Community has initiated proceedings in the WTO to request consultations with Korea in accordance with the memorandum of agreement on the rules and procedures governing the WTO's dispute settlement procedure, and may continue in operation only until that procedure shall have been concluded. It is therefore proposed that it should no longer apply after the proceedings in the WTO have been either concluded or suspended and that it should in any case lapse on 31 December 2002.</p>
<p>The proposal is based on Articles 87(3) and 89 of the Treaty. Article 89 provides for Council rulings to be given by qualified majority vote following consultation with the European Parliament. Parliament's advice was sought by a letter of 29 August 2001 and given in the Parliamentary part-session of 12-15 November 2001.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposal has been tabled to be adopted at the Council meeting of 4 and 5 December 2001.</p>
<p>The said proposal is being studied, and the Council has not, at this stage, had occasion to make any statement on the specific questions raised by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the latest annual report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, opium production in Afghanistan has fallen strikingly as a result of the Taliban's prohibition policy From being the world's leading exporter, the country now accounts for only 10% of world trade in opium.

<p>In the light of this situation, the desperate plight of the population and the priorities set by the European Council meeting in Ghent to provide humanitarian aid for the Afghan people and embark on the reconstruction of Afghanistan, does the Council intend to take practical initiatives or to include aid for farmers in its reconstruction programme in order to dissuade producers from reverting to growing opium or selling the stocks that they still have?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Council is quite aware of the problem raised by the honourable Member. However, it would like to make it clear from the outset that aid to the opium cultivation replacement policy is not part of our humanitarian aid policy but rather of the development and reconstruction aid policy.</p>
<p>This being the case, the Council refers the honourable Member to the declaration of the Heads of State and Government at Ghent on 19 October 2001 on the follow up to the September 11 attacks and, in particular, to item 3 thereof, which states that humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries is a top priority. On that occasion, it was established that, together with other donors, the European Union and the Member States would make available all the aid necessary to meet the needs of the Afghan people and refugees. The Union intends to make every endeavour to alleviate the negative economic, financial and humanitarian consequences suffered by these countries.</p>
<p>The Council had already announced, at its meeting of 17 October 2001, that the Union was going to raise over EUR 320 million of humanitarian aid as a top priority without delay. In this regard, the earmarking of EUR 25 million of the reserve should enable the Commission (ECHO) to respond to the most pressing humanitarian needs. The Council advises the honourable Member to refer to the Commission for a breakdown of the uses to which the funds are to be put.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the Council has agreed a number of points as guidelines for the Union’s future work on Afghanistan, once it is free of the Al-Qaida network and its terrorists. These points include keeping humanitarian aid and the reconstruction plan for the country as top priorities.</p>
<p>Clearly, at things stand at present, the Council cannot provide any further details regarding the content of this reconstruction plan because everything still depends on the progress and results achieved by the military operations and on the search for a political solution for the future in Afghanistan. However, I can also tell you unequivocally that, when the time comes to examine the Commission’s proposals in this field, the Council will ensure that the reconstruction plan gives priority to this issue. The Council will focus especially on the conversion of opium poppy cultivation to ensure that subsequent aid can alleviate the inevitable effects that this will have on the farmers in terms of their basic means of subsistence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0859"></a>

<p>2. The Council has undertaken the examination of the Commission proposal for a directive of the EP and of the Council amending Council directive 91/671/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes.</p>
<p>3. At its meeting of 16-17 July 2001, the Council noted the opinion issued at first reading by the European Parliament on 31 May 2001, in which Parliament expressed its concern as to the question of child safety.</p>
<p>4. The Presidency also believes that the adoption of this act will bring about maximum added value for the occupants of a vehicle, particularly children, which will be achieved in an appropriate manner when in-depth scientific studies, indicating the best possible solution, have been completed.</p>
<p>These studies are currently underway and when the conclusions are made available, the Presidency hopes to be able to overcome the differences of opinion that persist on this point in particular, both in the Member States and at the Commission.

<p>The Commission is not aware of cases of systematic fraud which have not been punished by the competent national authorities by suspending or revoking the relevant marketing authorisations. The Commission would be grateful if the Honourable Member could provide any relevant information which would allow the Commission to take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is not aware of any restrictive practices which would affect the ability of academic or other scientists to perform independent research and thus would impact on public health considerations. Pharmaceutical companies have the right to prevent inappropriate or commercial use of their intellectual property especially as represented by an active substance included in a medicinal product. To the Commission’s knowledge, it is standard practice that undertakings request from the scientists who receive such material to ensure that the research is legitimate and appropriate. The Commission is not in a position to comment on individual contractual arrangements between a specific company and a specific scientist or academic institution.</p>
<p>The Commission takes seriously the question of transparency in research pertaining to pharmaceuticals within the next Framework Program.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of new pharmaceutical compounds, the objectives are to foster academic and industrial collaboration through technological platforms. Multidisciplinary approaches using cutting edge technologies arising from genomic research such as pharmacogenomics may contribute to health care progress and cost reduction. This can be achieved through more precise diagnosis, individualised treatment and more efficient development pathways for new drugs and therapies, and other novel products of the new technologies.</p>
<p>However, socially responsible choices, public acceptance and an efficient development pathway for these new technologies have to be ensured.

<p>The Commission welcomes this question as it creates an opportunity to clarify some of the misunderstanding that has arisen around the interoperability of digital television equipment – which is an important issue.</p>
<p>First of all what is meant with the term “interoperable standard for interactive digital television” is the following. An interoperable standard for interactive digital television refers to the software installed into a set top box or a television set which allows the operating system of the set top box or TV to process interactive applications, such as electronic programme guides, that are viewed on the screen.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six such standards being used around Europe. Their presence is invisible to the viewer, but they are of concern to the broadcaster who has to tailor his broadcast signals to the standard used by different set top boxes.</p>
<p>Clearly broadcasters would prefer to have one standard and not six. It is easier to inter-operate with one standard system than with six. That is why the industry has developed the standard known as multimedia home platform (MHP).</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the potential advantages inherent in the MHP standard. It's a good standard and the Commission has supported its development. It's not fully mature yet, but it’s nearly there.</p>
<p>But the Commission does not believe that a single standard should be imposed at this time by law, particularly in light of the large installed base of receivers. Broadcasting is part of a converging world where technology is evolving rapidly. Rather than intervene prematurely in a market where the technology is developing very quickly, the Commission prefers to encourage the process of voluntary industry led standardisation for interactive digital television, and to monitor progress on how well that process works before considering possible intervention.</p>
<p>The discussions held earlier this year by the Member of the Commission in charge of Information Society and Enterprise on MHP with industry revealed a classic chicken-and-egg problem. Manufacturers expected costs to fall once demand grows; but demand will not grow until costs fall. In recent months, however, more encouraging signs began to be seen. National and regional operator groups have committed themselves to MHP; Australia and South America are actively considering MHP. Impetus is building up behind MHP and critical mass may soon be reached. MHP is succeeding as a European standard, and the Commission sees no justification for mandating its use through legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0833"></a>

<p>1. The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. These principles are common to all the Member States.</p>
<p>This was formally confirmed with the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is certainly the basis for the area of freedom, security and justice itself, the maintenance and development of which was called for by the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p>2. However, the Commission notes that Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. The situation described by Mr Olsson does not fall within the scope of Union law, and the Charter therefore cannot be used in this case to assess the behaviour of the Greek authorities or national Greek legislation on temporary detention.</p>
<p>3. Moreover, the Commission would point out that the Treaties do not confer on it the power to investigate suspected cases of police brutality in the Member States.</p>
<p>4. In the event of breach of fundamental rights, which are general principles of Community law definitively interpreted in the Charter, the Commission could take action on the grounds of this breach against the Member State concerned under Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, provided that the breach occurred in the field of Community law.</p>
<p>In addition, under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission can refer the matter to the Council, meeting at Heads of State and Government level, so that it can determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach of fundamental rights. The conditions for recourse to this article are clearly not met in the case in question.</p>
<p>5. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the party concerned can instigate appeal proceedings in his own country and, if he does not receive satisfaction there, he can take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights if there has been a breach of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0860"></a>

<p>1. The Commission is unaware of situations existing in the Member States that fail to comply with the fundamental principles of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</p>
<p>This was solemnly reaffirmed by the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which constitutes the very foundation of the area of freedom, security and justice, the maintenance and development of which are required by the Amsterdam Treaty. Article 47 of the Charter (Right to an effective remedy and to a fait trial) provides that the trial shall be “within a reasonable time”.</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has been seized on numerous occasions with applications for a ruling that the pre-trial detention time was too long. Despite the number of applications on the point, it has not laid down any guidelines regarding “reasonable” pre-trial detention periods, other than to say that an individual held in pre-trial detention is entitled to expect “special diligence” (Tomasi v. France, 241-A Ser. A para. 84) and the rights of such an individual to have the case determined expeditiously must be balanced against the efforts of the authorities to carry out their tasks with proper care (Van der Tang v. Spain, 26/1994/473/554).</p>
<p>2. The Commission notes however that pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter (Scope), the provisions of the Charter must show due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and that “this Charter does not establish any new power…for the Community or the Union”.</p>
<p>The principle of subsidiarity leaves the Member States free to lay down what they consider to be appropriate minimum periods for remands in custody. Consequently, as regards the first question, it is not appropriate for the Commission, in the light of current Community law, to adopt a position on whether remands in custody of up to 18 months are reasonable.</p>
<p>The remedy available to the Swedish citizen referred to in the question is to bring an action in the Greek courts for judicial review of the detention decision. When all domestic remedies have been exhausted, an application may be made to the European Court of Human Rights to examine whether, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, the detention period is in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>3. As regards the second question, protecting the rights of individuals has been one of the Commission’s priorities for some time now.</p>
<p>The Commission Communication, Towards an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, commits the Commission to “respect for individual rights”. The Conclusions of the Tampere European Council stated that “enhanced mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate cooperation between authorities and the judicial protection of individual rights”. (point 33).</p>
<p>The Commission Communication on Mutual Recognition of Final Decisions in Criminal Matters provides that “it must therefore be ensured that the treatment of suspects and the rights of the defence would not only not suffer from the implementation of the principle [of mutual recognition] but that the safeguards would even be improved through the process” (paragraph 10).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing a consultation document for external circulation, and intends to issue a Communication in the spring of 2002 covering the rights of those involved in criminal proceedings throughout the Union. It is hoped to achieve greater harmonisation in the enforcement of rights conferred, inter alia, by the European Convention. These rights include the right not to be held in pre-trial detention unless absolutely necessary and the right to humane conditions of detention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0847"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the Médecins sans frontières campaign on the rights of ill foreign nationals in Europe. It supports the objective of gradually establishing a level playing field for foreign nationals to have access to health care and emergency treatment in Europe, in accordance with the provisions of the EC Treaty, the Tampere conclusions on asylum and immigration and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>The Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises that everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices. A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. This provision does not apply solely to Union citizens. Like the question of access for third country nationals to health care, this issue is closely related to public health protection in the Member States.</p>
<p>These principles have inspired the Commission in its various initiatives in the fields of asylum and immigration. Thus, the proposal for a directive on the reception of applicants for asylum contains provisions relating to access to health care as well as the directive on temporary protection in the event of a massive influx of displaced persons formally adopted by the Council in July 2001 and the recent proposal for a directive on the qualification for refugee status and subsidiary protection.</p>
<p>As regards admission, the Commission has specified in recent initiatives that, although Member States might have been able to refuse entry to third country nationals on public health grounds, the emergence of an illness or infirmity after the issue of the residence permit cannot alone justify refusal to renew the residence permit or expulsion from the territory.</p>
<p>With regard to third country nationals who have been resident in the territory of a Member State for a long time, the proposal for a Commission directive stipulates that they should receive treatment on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union in matters of social protection, including social security and health care.</p>
<p>In the communication to be adopted shortly by the Commission on illegal immigration, the Commission stresses the need to develop common standards on expulsion, detention and repatriation. A major principle is that voluntary repatriation should be given priority over forced repatriation. In addition, there must be greater analysis of the consequences of people entering and living in a country illegally. A Green Paper on the issue of repatriation is also being prepared by the Commission. The situation of seriously ill illegal immigrants will be studied in this context.</p>
<p>Furthermore, account must be taken of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights which already govern the Member States’ procedures for expelling ill foreigners.</p>
<p>The Commission points out that the directive on temporary protection contains a binding provision which specifies that, when temporary protection comes to an end, the Member States must adopt the necessary measures regarding the conditions of residence of people who cannot be expected to travel for health reasons because, for example, they would suffer seriously from interruption of their treatment. As long as this situation persists, these people must not be expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission points out that there are cases in which the health grounds cited may have been done so fraudulently and solely in order to avoid repatriation to the person’s country of origin.</p>
<p>The health provisions introduced into European legislation on the status of third country nationals in the Union must therefore strike a balance between fair, humanitarian treatment provided with due respect for human rights and the ordered management of migration flows. It must also go hand in hand with an external action providing access to medicines and support for health structures, particularly in the poorest developing countries, and the Commission has recently stepped up its endeavours in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0777"></a>

In the White Paper on ‘European Governance’, the Commission has again emphasised the need for each institution to concentrate on its essential tasks and has made a number of proposals which could already be put into effect without modifying the current treaties.

<p>The Honourable Member is correct in stating that the rule of law, and respect for minority rights, are key conditions applying to Union relations with, and assistance for, the former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and its neighbours.</p>
<p>The issue of the Kosovo Albanian detainees is one of the many factors which are taken into account. Across the broad range of Union conditions, political and economic, the FRY has made sufficient progress to justify continued assistance, itself necessary in order to support the reform process and the reformers.</p>
<p>The Commission remains very concerned by the issue raised by the Honourable Member and takes every available opportunity to raise it with those in a position to make decisions on this matter in Belgrade.</p>
<p>As the figures mentioned by the Honourable Member imply, progress has been made.</p>
<p>Of the estimated nearly 2000 prisoners who were transferred from Kosovo to Serbia in 1999, the Serbian Justice Ministry states that 167 Kosovar Albanians remain in prison.</p>
<p>The remaining prisoners' cases are being reviewed and, where convictions cannot be supported by evidence, they are being released. Where there are grounds for appeals, appeals are being launched. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) monitors the condition of the individual prisoners, and maintains contacts with their families.

<p>1. The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concerns on the migration flows originating from, or transiting through, Turkey in the direction of some Member States. A significant number of cases are indeed related to immigration into Greece, such as the one of July 2001 involving a group of more than 200 African nationals who were stranded for a long period on the border between Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>2. The Commission pays close attention to the question of illegal migration in general and will present a Communication on this subject in the nearest future.</p>
<p>3. The Commission has raised the issue of illegal immigration at several occasions, for example at the Community-Turkey Association Council of 26 June 2001 and at the subcommittees under the Community-Turkey Association Agreement.</p>
<p>It has asked Turkey to take more effective measures to combat illegal immigration. This priority is part of the Accession Partnership with Turkey, which also highlights the need for Turkey to starting aligning with the Union acquis and practices on migration, as well as to strengthen border management. The Commission will continue monitoring the progress of Turkey in this field, in the framework of the accession process.</p>

<p>Investigations in the Member States since July this year revealed the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo-(a)-pyrene, in olive pomace oil from Spain, Italy and Greece. The Member States found that the production method was responsible for the contamination of this olive residue oil. PAHs are not formed in olive oils.</p>
<p>The actions taken in Member States were reported to the Rapid Alert System for Food, and these included removing the oil from the market, testing for PAHs, destroying products and sending oil back to origin.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Expert Committee on Contaminants in Food on 3 October 2001 it became clear that the heating process used to dry the olive residue and extract the oil was responsible for the formation of PAHs. Further studies by the industry are needed to clarify what is best production practice. At present, producers can however ensure that products do not contain unacceptable levels of PAHs by using effective refining processes.</p>
<p>No harmonised Community maximum levels exist for PAHs in food. Nevertheless the general food safety provisions of the framework regulation on contaminants apply, which provide that a food containing a contaminant in an amount which is unacceptable from the public health viewpoint shall not be placed on the market. In such cases Member States may take national action to protect consumer safety.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Food is currently carrying out an evaluation aiming to clarify the risk from PAHs. In addition, the Member States are collecting data for a co-ordinated assessment of the occurrence of these chemicals in foodstuffs. Then if necessary Community maximum levels will be set for PAHs, such as benzo-(a)-pyrene, in foods.</p>
<p>As far as the impact on the industry is concerned, the Commission agrees that this problem is giving a negative image of the sector. It is therefore imperative that the industry implements the necessary preventative measures, such as decontamination with activated charcoal. The Commission has encouraged the Member States to investigate production practices to find ways to reduce the formation of PAHs and to promote decontamination. Contacts have also been made with the professional organisations asking them to abide by the general principle that food placed on the market must be safe and that it is primarily their responsibility to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0789"></a>

<p>The veterinary conditions applicable to movements between Member States of cats and dogs accompanying their owners fall within an area that has not yet been harmonised.</p>

<p>It is in order to compensate for this lack of harmonisation that, on 18 September 2000, the Commission forwarded to Parliament and to the Council a draft regulation, the purpose of which is specifically to lay down common regulations for these movements.</p>
<p>Parliament has already, in the context of the co-decision procedure, issued an opinion, at first reading, on this proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission has pointed out that the provisions of Article 8 of this draft regulation will enable the Swedish authorities, in the context of a decision by the Commission in the light of the opinion of the Permanent Veterinary Committee, to maintain the requirement for carnivores to be dewormed before they enter Swedish territory.</p>
<p>Until such time as this draft regulation is adopted, the specific agreements between Sweden and Denmark may only therefore be reconsidered in the context of bilateral negotiations between the two Member States concerned.</p>

<p>The merger between Swedish commercial vehicle manufacturers Scania and Volvo and that between the SEB bank and Föreningssparbanken have been rejected or made extremely difficult by the Commission, which says that they will give the merged firms far too dominant a position on the domestic market, i.e. in Sweden. Sweden's prime minister believes that the Commission is adopting a far too narrow national market-based view and is preventing firms in smaller Member States from developing internationally.</p>
<p>In these times of an increasingly integrated European market, how is the Commission dealing with the problem that the competition rules can in fact result in firms being treated differently, depending on their country of origin? Will this lead to a revision in the near future of EU legislation, the application of competition policy and the definition of domestic market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The competition rules do not involve a definition of "home markets". Instead, they involve as one part of the analysis a definition of relevant markets, the purpose of which is to establish the product(s) and geographic area(s) where, for example, merged firms could exert market power.</p>
<p>In the Volvo/Scania case, the Commission found that such market power would have been created in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway. In the abandoned Swedish Banks case (SEB/Föreningssparbanken), the parties agreed with the Commission that only the Swedish banking market was affected.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to note that statistically the competition rules do not result in firms being treated differently, depending on their country of origin. Over the last 5 years, 1295 merger decisions were adopted, and just below 15% of these involved a definition of national markets. Looking specifically at cases involving companies from Nordic countries, the statistics reveal an even smaller number of cases where national markets were defined (10.5%).</p>
<p>As a final comment about the effects of market integration in the Community, it is true that the faster barriers fall and markets become integrated, the easier it will be for companies from small Member States to consolidate, even domestically, without creating or reinforcing a dominant position. However, until dependable data confirms that the process of widening is truly underway, competition analysis must base itself on the observable facts, not on wishful thinking. This essentially means that large companies in small markets should have a strategic interest in promoting the opening up of markets, rather than, as has often been the tendency in the past, protecting entrenched positions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0799"></a>

<p>The Czech authorities gave the following explanation in a technical meeting on 24 October 2001:</p>
<p>The import licensing requirements on cement are not actually new. They existed in previous legislation (Law No 42/1980 on Foreign Trade) and were simply continued in the new law of 2000.</p>
<p>Import licenses for cement are granted automatically, since they exist for statistical purposes only, allowing the Czech authorities to monitor trade flows. In administrative terms, a Czech importer must fill in an application form and provide a copy of the contract. Imported cement must be in conformity with the Czech technical standard (CSN EN 197 (72 2101)), which is identical with the harmonised European standard (EN 197) The Czech authorities also stated that they were not aware of any complaints by Community manufacturers about their import licensing system for cement.</p>

On 27 July 2000, a state of emergency was declared which has been extended repeatedly and is still in force.

Is the Commission aware of these extremely serious violations of fundamental rights?

<p>In the field of agricultural enlargement the Commission intends to present the position of the Community on quotas, direct payments and transition periods, with a view to closing the agricultural chapter in the second half of the year 2002 with the most advanced candidate countries. The Commission will continue its heavy investment in the pre-accession period through the SAPARD programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission will need to pursue World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations with a view to balance the maintenance of instruments necessary for agricultural reform and multifunctional agriculture with progressive liberalisation and a fairer trading system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0815"></a>

<p>Articles 3 and 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty commit the Community to a high level of health protection across the whole range of its policies and actions. Developing the Community health agenda as set out in the May 2000 Communication on the health strategy of the Community is a major priority of this Commission. This strategy has two main components: first, the work on public health and, second, to ensure that all policies and actions work in a co-ordinated and coherent way towards achieving the Community’s health objectives.</p>
<p>In this context, pharmaceuticals policy is an important health-related area of Community action. The review of pharmaceutical legislation proposes measures to expedite the delivery of new medicines to the market, by reducing the time taken to process market authorisation and allowing fast track procedures to operate in certain instances where public health considerations require very fast authorisation.</p>
<p>Moreover, earlier this year, the Commissioner in charge of Enterprises and Information Society and the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection launched a joint initiative to develop work in the field of pharmaceuticals. The so-called G10 Group brings together both the public health and industry agendas at Community level. There is a wide-ranging public health agenda which relates to targeted innovation, cost-effectiveness analysis, rational prescription, and enhanced post-marketing pharmaco-vigilance to name only some of the issues. The G10 Group will also be considering the crucial question of the empowerment of patients and the quality of information available to patients as regards the drugs they use. Its work will lay the foundations for ensuring that the principles outlined in the Honourable Member’s question find their way into the Community’s activities in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0817"></a>

<p>Directive 75/442/EEC on waste as amended stipulates a number of obligations for Member State in connection with the management of waste disposal. Specifically, Article 4 requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. Member States are required under that provision to take the necessary measures to prohibit the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste. In addition to Directive 75/442/EEC, Member States must comply with the provisions set out in Directive 91/689/EEC2 on hazardous waste. Furthermore, landfills must comply with the specific requirements set out in Directive 1999/31/EC3 on the landfill of waste.</p>

<p>The Commission deplores racist and xenophobic violence of any kind. The Commission is very concerned about the racist attacks which have taken place in a number of EU countries against people of different ethnic origin and/or different religions and which, in certain cases, may be reactions to the recent terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna and responsible for analysing incidents and manifestations of racism and xenophobia, has an important role to play in this context. Following the attacks of 11 September, the Monitoring Centre has examined the possibility of an increase in racism and xenophobia, directed particularly against Muslim communities, and has, as far as possible, tried to identify good practices to limit any secondary effect of the attacks. The Monitoring Centre’s initial report on this subject shows that the events in the United States seem to have had a fairly limited impact in the majority of EU countries. Although, in a number of Member States, there has been an increase in physical and verbal attacks, in others no such increase has been observed. The Commission is very pleased about the fact that, in almost all Member States, joint ecumenical initiatives rejecting any identification of Islam with terrorism have been taken by the representatives of various religious faiths.</p>
<p>On 27 November 2000, the Council unanimously adopted, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, a decision establishing a programme of Community action to combat discrimination.<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> The programme is intended to promote measures to prevent and combat any direct or indirect discrimination, characterised by one or more than one incident and elicited by the victims’ racial or ethnic origin, religious or other convictions, handicap, age or sexual orientation. One of its objectives is, partly by means of awareness-raising activities, to promote and disseminate values and practices based on the fight against discrimination.</p>
<p>The fight to end racism and all forms of discrimination, as well as to promote inter-cultural education, is one of the overall objectives of programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo and Jeunesse.</p>
<p>The priority of the Jeunesse programme, in particular, is to combat racism at the same time as promoting a better understanding of Europe’s cultural diversity, as well as of its shared basic values<span class="sup">2</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of Leonardo, initiatives on the theme of the fight against racism and xenophobia are to be put in place in response to the events of 11 September. The emphasis will be placed upon the fight against racism in the workplace and in society in general.</p>
<p>Appropriate criminal sanctions are an important tool for combating racism and xenophobia. On 15 July 1996, a Joint Action to combat racism and xenophobia was adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union in order to provide for effective legal cooperation between Member States. All Member States have adopted legislative measures prohibiting racist violence and incitement to racial hatred, but their scope and content and the ways in which they are applied differ considerably. In the next few weeks, the Commission will present a draft framework decision aimed at reconciling the different legislation and regulations of the Member States concerning racist and xenophobic offences. The main objective in doing this is to ensure that such offences are punished in all the Member States by effective and proportionate penalties of a deterrent nature, leading if need be to the extradition or handing over of offenders.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the Stockholm European Council of March 2001, the Commission has taken the commitment to present a policy strategy on biotechnology and life sciences. This strategy, which will include an action plan, is intended to be presented at the beginning of 2002.</p>
<p>In March 2001, the Commission adopted a broad approach to deal with all relevant issues for such a strategy, including regulation, research, competitiveness/innovation, public opinion, ethics and the international context. In order to address issues in a coherent way, the Commission set up a Steering Group composed of competent cabinets and services.</p>
<p>In line with its policy on governance, the Commission has launched a broad consultation process to get views from all stakeholders. In September 2001, the Commission adopted a consultation document that provided a comprehensive overview of biotechnology and suggested key issues and questions on which comments were particularly sought. A dedicated web-site has been created to facilitate comments. On 27/28 September 2001, the Commission organised a consultative Stakeholders’ Conference, which was attended by more than 300 representatives of Member States, third countries, the European Institutions and a large variety of civil society representatives, including non-governmental organisations. Members of the Parliament took an active role in this conference.</p>
<p>The Stakeholders’ Conference was very encouraging: the consultation paper was well received and there was wide-spread support for the idea of a more comprehensive strategy for the development of life sciences and biotechnology in Europe. The public consultation exercise will continue until November 23 and has already attracted very substantial submissions. The Commission is confident that this broad process of reflection will lead to a comprehensive, well-founded and coherent strategy and action plan in line with the commitment taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0828"></a>

<p>In view of the difficulties the majority of Member States currently have in forwarding lists of sites without regard to socio-economic factors and of the future difficulties of managing such sites, given that local people are left out of the notification procedure, is it not now necessary to amend Annex III to Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 with a view to ensuring sustainable development?</p>
<p>Is amendment of Annex III not needed in this respect in order to ensure the support of local people for the principles governing management of the sites in future?

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>At the end of September and the beginning of October this year a Finnish national was on a walking holiday in the hills of Northern Portugal (the Peneda-Gerês nature reserve). The person in question is visually handicapped and is unable to walk without his/her guide dog. The guide dog was very well received on the aeroplane (Luxair), on the airport bus at Porto Airport, on the Portuguese railways and in taxis, but on 4 October 2001 the company operating the coach between Porto and Braga (a major university town) and from Braga to Gerês (an important tourist centre) refused to allow the guide dog to travel. The railways were on strike and the only alternative was to make the 100 km journey by taxi. The ban on dogs in Braga coaches is absolute and also applies to guide dogs, and the managers of the bus station do not make any exceptions even if the dog is muzzled. It should be recalled that this was a guide dog specially trained for visually handicapped people, with the proper documentation to prove it. Such dogs are the eyes of visually handicapped people.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware that visually handicapped people are discriminated against in Portugal by being refused access to public transport (coaches) with their guide dogs? Has the coach company been guilty of discrimination in contravention of Portuguese legislation and Community regulations? What does the Commission propose to do to put an end to this type of discrimination against visually handicapped people in Portugal and in the Member States generally?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is unfamiliar with the issue of discrimination against visually handicapped people travelling with their guide dogs in Portugal, and therefore asked the competent Portuguese Ministry (Ministry of Social Affairs) to clarify this point and provide details of legislation on the subject. In fact, there is a Decree-Law (No 1182999) of 14 April 1999 obliging all public transport companies to provide access for all passengers, including visually handicapped people travelling with their guide dogs. It is thus apparent that the Portuguese company did not apply the law in force and that the Finnish citizen may therefore make a complaint to the competent Portuguese Ministry (Ministry of Labour and Solidarity).</p>
<p>With regard to Community legislation, it is clearly laid down in the EC Treaty (Article 13) that the Community may, within the scope of its powers, take action to fight all types of discrimination (including against people with disabilities). Furthermore, Declaration No 22 of the same Treaty stipulates that the Community must take account of the needs of handicapped people when drawing up legislation concerning the internal market.</p>
<p>In practice, the Community has Regulation (EEC) No 1191/69<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> of the Council of 26 June 1969 on action by the Member States concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service. However, the scope of this regulation is limited, the margin for interpretation is wide, and it does not clearly stipulate requirements regarding accessibility and quality of service. In order to update this regulation, the Commission issued a revision thereof in its proposal for a regulation on action by Member States, concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service and the granting of public service contracts in transport by rail, road and inland waterway<span class="sup">2</span>. This proposal is currently being discussed with Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has prepared a directive on specific provisions relating to buses/coaches (amending Directives 70/156 and 97/27)<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span>.

<p>1. According to the elements, which are at the disposal of the Commission, the waste water treatment plant in Ermioni in Greece has been co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).</p>
<p>The construction of this treatment plant has been started in 1993 with a total budget of 120 million drachmas (approximately 400.000 €) in the frame of the Community initiative ENVIREG. This amount was considered as insufficient to build the treatment plant. The co-financing of the project has continued in the framework of the Operational Programme (O.P.) for Environment 1994 – 1999 which has, amongst others, the objective to finish a number of municipal waste water treatment plants started by ENVIREG.</p>
<p>The additional budget granted for the project during the 8th meeting of the follow-up meeting of the O.P. on 28 June 1999, was 582.979.000 drachmas (approximately 1,7 million €, 75% subsidies). At the end of 2000, the project was completed to 87%.</p>
<p>The Commission informed the Greek authorities on the problem raised by the Honourable Member by letter of 29 October 2001. The Commission required Greece not to include the used amounts for this project in the final declaration of expenses of the mentioned programme (which has to be submitted to the Commission by the Greek State in 2002), in case this project should not be finished by the end of 2001.</p>
<p>2. With regard to Council Directive 91/271/EEC1 concerning urban waste water, there exist provisions in order to prevent discharges of untreated urban waste water into the sea. However these provisions are valid for large agglomerations.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Directive, Member States were obliged to provide appropriate treatment for agglomerations larger than 10.000 population equivalents (p.e.) by the latest at 31 December 1998 (in sensitive areas) and larger than 15.000 p.e. by the latest at 31 December 2000 (in normal areas). For smaller agglomerations appropriate waste water treatment has to be in place by the latest at 31 December 2005.</p>
<p>3. The Commission has no information on the agglomeration of Ermioni, so far. This supports the estimation that this agglomeration is of a size with less than 10.000 p.e. Under these conditions an appropriate treatment (secondary treatment) has - according community law - to be provided not before 31 December 2005.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission invites the Honourable Member to submit more detailed information on the wastewater treatment plant in Ermioni, in case it should be of further interest to assess, if Greece has infringed its obligations deriving from EC environmental law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0832"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member about weaknesses in the Greek food safety, animal health and plant health control systems that have been repeatedly identified in more than 30 inspections conducted by the Food and Veterinary Office during the period 1998-2001.</p>
<p>The Commission has written on several occasions to the Greek authorities to draw their attention to specific serious problems. The Greek Minister of Agriculture replied on 27 April 2001 providing a preliminary response to some of the main issues that have been the subject of recommendations of the Food and Veterinary Office in recent years. He gave general guarantees, including in particular the recruitment of 150 new veterinary staff by the end of this year, a plan for the reorganisation of the Ministry of Agriculture and concrete plans for improvements in veterinary controls. Two high level meetings took place in May and September 2001, and the Commission is still waiting to receive clear commitments from the Greek authorities to address the many deficiencies which remain outstanding. As soon as detailed corrective measures are taken, appropriate missions could be planned to verify on the spot, following the usual procedure of the Food and Veterinary Office. Such follow up missions have already been carried out as regards dairy products and the eradication of Brucellosis, but showed limited progress in both areas.</p>
<p>The Commission considers this matter as a very high priority, for both parties, because it cannot countenance persistent poor standards within the Community. Progress is also imperative to ensure that the identified risks to public and animal health do not materialise. Therefore it has made it clear to the Greek authorities that it is not satisfied with the current slow rate of progress. While meetings at senior official level will continue in order to review progress in the implementation of promised actions, a greater commitment from the Greek authorities to addressing the identified weaknesses is the key measure necessary to improve the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0834"></a>

<p>The Commission proposed to Council on 28 August 2001 measures on maximum limits on dioxins as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the presence of dioxins in the environment, feed and food. In the framework of this comprehensive strategy the Commission will pay particular attention to the problem of contamination through emissions, discharges and losses of the seas by persistent organic substances, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This will include an identification of sources and proposals of measures to reduce the contamination of the sea.</p>
<p>The most important objective of this strategy is the protection of public health by reducing human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.</p>
<p>The measures for the reduction of human exposure through food are justified by the fact that the intake of dioxins by a considerable part of the European population exceeds the tolerable intake set by the Scientific Committee on Food.</p>
<p>All aspects of the impact of the proposals have been taken into account including the socio-economic impact and it must be clear that the necessary level of human health protection must be facilitated based on the scientific advice the Commission has received.</p>
<p>The proposed measures are still under consideration in Council where Member States will have the opportunity to present their concerns. Ensuring a high level of public health and food safety is the driving force behind the proposed measures.</p>
<p>A recent study containing data from the whole Union, has indicated that fish originating from certain parts of the Baltic Sea is more contaminated by dioxins and PCBs than fish originating from other European waters. This means that the sector concerned will have to adapt and all options for assisting it to do so need rapid examination.</p>
<p>The proposed measures will ensure that fish and fishery products are as safe as possible. They will contribute to maintain and even improve the confidence of consumers in the safety of fish and fishery products. This is the best way to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from the indisputable positive health effects derived from consumption of fish as part of a varied diet that is generally recommended.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0836"></a>

<p>For three years now, before the end of the regular tuna-fishing season in the Bay of Biscay and adjacent waters, part of the Basque fleet and fleets from other Cantabrian ports (around 40 vessels) have fished for anchovies in Zone VIIIa between the months of October and December. Access to the zone concerned is not restricted for these vessels, nor have their catches exceeded the ‘quotas’ available for the years concerned, including 2001.</p>
<p>Yet although this fishing has been conducted in an entirely legal manner, a threat has been made openly by the French fisheries sector, which wants to prevent the marketing and transhipment of the catches in French ports, overlooking the fact that Spain cedes an annual anchovy quota of 9000 tonnes to France.</p>
<p>What urgent measures will the Commission take through its Directorates-General for fisheries and the internal market to stop restrictions being imposed on Spanish vessels in an illegal, unjustified and unjustifiable manner and prevent what is now merely a threat from turning into a serious conflict?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay is a traditional source of conflict between, on the one hand, the fleets of the Basque country and other Spanish ports on the Atlantic coast, which use encircling nets, and on the other the French fleet, which mainly use pelagic trawl.</p>
<p>In the past, these problems have been dealt with satisfactorily for both parties thanks to dialogue and cooperation. In Arcachon in 1992, an agreement, the “Josselin Agreement”, was drawn up, establishing a code of good conduct for this fishing ground. This agreement is still in force and may be viewed as a starting point in the search for a solution.</p>
<p>Following Mr Ortuondo Larrea’s question, the Commission has been informed of the events that have taken place between the French and Spanish fishermen in the French ports of La Rochelle and Saint Nazaire.</p>

<p>1. The Commission has a number of educational programmes under way in the field of women’s education in Arab countries. Since 1995, the current MEDA programme has decided to fund very significant forms of support for basic education. One of the major objectives is to increase access to education. As a matter of actual fact, this particularly applies to the female population. Such support for basic education is to be found particularly in the following countries: Egypt, 1998 (EUR 100 million), Morocco, 1998 (EUR 40 million), Turkey, 1999 (EUR 100 million), Tunisia, 2000 (EUR 40 million) and Algeria, where the amount for 2002/3 is still to be decided.</p>
<p>2. Over and above basic education, it is integral to many other current social projects explicitly to take women into account:</p>
<p>professional training programmes, relating partly to equal opportunities and women’s access to professional life;</p>
<p>support programmes for gender issues, partly with a view to favouring development strategies that take account, and increase the status, of the role of women in social and economic life;</p>
<p>a Euro-Mediterranean regional programme for the benefit of women. This programme, which has just been accepted by the Mediterranean partners, is aimed, at a regional level, at enhancing women’s participation in economic life, partly through education, training and access to the labour market.</p>
<p>3. Moreover, numerous other social projects that do not make explicit reference to support specifically for women are, in point of fact, programmes that support women. That is true where the following areas are concerned: health, education, the labour market, local development and civil society. It is also true when for all the programmes designed to combat poverty and to reach the most vulnerable population groups. The services of the Commission will be attentive to the need to take more account of women when implementing social projects. As may be seen from the draft Country Strategy Papers for 2002-2006, these initiatives in favour of women, described within the framework of Meda I, should be reinforced by the Meda II initiatives. More generally, funding under Meda II should cover the social sectors to the tune of 40%. Moreover, dialogue and consultation are taking place at intervals, along the lines of the Regional Forum on the role of women in economic development, organised on 13 and 14 July 2001 in Brussels. There can only be more such examples of dialogue and consultation to supplement the role of projects and programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0842"></a>

<p>On 25 October 2001 organisations representing French cattle farmers and the meat industry and meat trade reached an agreement on minimum prices for slaughter cattle and a temporary suspension of meat imports. The agreement has been concluded for one month, but there is already press speculation concerning an extension. The French Minister of Agriculture applauded the agreement as one whose conclusion he had 'called for, urged and encouraged'.</p>
<p>Does the Commission regard this agreement, particularly the provisions on the suspension of imports, as consistent with European rules on the free movement of goods within the EU and with European cartel and competition law? What steps does the Commission plan to take to counter the agreement?</p>
<p>Can the Commission clarify the role of the French Government in the conclusion of the agreement?

<p>The TINA transport network is the result of a technical investigation carried out on the initiative of the Commission between 1995 and 1999 in cooperation with candidate countries with a view to identifying the elements of the future trans-European transport network, the TETN, that will cover these countries after their accession to the EU. With regard to this, the TINA network has been developed in accordance with the objectives and priorities of Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, which are brought together in decision No 1692/96/EC<span class="sup">1<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></span>, recently amended by decision No 1346/2001/EC<span class="sup">2<a href="#defann_44_2" name="refann_44_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></span>. These guidelines explicitly incorporate the protection of the environment and respect for the environmental ‘acquis communautaire’ as essential elements in the implementation of this network.</p>
<p>The implementation of the ISPA programme and finance from the European Investment Bank (EIB) is additionally to conform to all Community policy and legislation with regard to the environment. Within this context, it is worth pointing out the obligation of beneficiary countries to respect the procedures set out in directives Nos 85/337/EEC<span class="sup">3<a href="#defann_44_3" name="refann_44_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></span> and 97/11/EC<span class="sup">4<a href="#defann_44_4" name="refann_44_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></span> with regard to the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. These directives demand a wide-ranging public consultation that can also include NGOs. Furthermore, a similar procedure to that set out in directives Nos 79/409/EEC<span class="sup">5<a href="#defann_44_5" name="refann_44_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a></span> on the conservation of wild birds and 92/43/EE<a href="#defann_44_6" name="refann_44_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>C<span class="sup">6</span> on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora is also to be applied within the framework of these projects.</p>
<p>With regard to the strategic environmental assessment mentioned by Mrs Jackson, the Commission points out that this particular approach was not incorporated into the design of the TINA network insofar as no recommended or approved methodology was available at that time. However, rules for the respect of areas already identified as environmentally sensitive were applied. From then on, analytical methods for conducting the strategic environmental assessment of transport infrastructure plans have been developed and tested, particularly in the context of the Fourth Framework Research and Development Programme and in pilot studies on the corridors.</p>
<p>Recent directive No 2001/42/EC<span class="sup">7<a href="#defann_44_7" name="refann_44_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a></span>, which covers strategic environmental assessment, is to be applied by Member States and provides for its own incorporation into national law from July 2004. In addition, and as provided for in the proposed amendment to decision No 1692/96/EC, adopted by the Commission on 2 October 2001, the Commission will, according to the principles of this directive, take account, in any future proposed revision of the guidelines, of the strategic environmental assessments covering the sensitive parts of the network.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the application of Community law in force, in addition to the close dialogue the Commission has developed with NGOs active in the area of environmental protection, will allow for the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas, in particular the internationally important bird areas, when, with Community co-financing, the TETN is implemented in the candidate countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A question mark has been raised over the legality of the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism to shipbuilding.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's assessment of the legality of the above proposal in the light of current WTO rules?</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that WTO rules do not allow countermeasures to be taken against a third country unless such countermeasures have been authorised in advance by the WTO or its agencies?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>In the view of the Commission, the proposal on a Temporary Defensive Mechanism is fully compatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) law and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) and the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement (ADA).</p>
<p>Compatibility with the WTO Subsidies Agreement</p>
<p>Subsidies, provided that they are not prohibited (i.e. export-contingent or local content-contingent) within the meaning of Article 3 of the ASCM and are not demonstrated to cause "adverse effects" within the meaning of Article 5 of the ASCM, are legitimate national policy instruments so far as the WTO is concerned. Thus, in principle, the Community has the right to grant aid to its shipbuilders. In fact the Community had been granting to its shipbuilding industry such type of aid for many years up to 31 December 2000.</p>
<p>The proposed aid (much like its predecessor scheme) neither imposes conditions so as to render it prohibited, nor it can be deemed to cause adverse effects to third countries, therefore, any claims of WTO incompatibility of the aid as such are groundless.</p>
<p>Compatibility with the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU)</p>
<p>Article 23 DSU prohibits the unilateral suspension of concessions or other obligations under the WTO covered agreements vis-à-vis other WTO Members; for such action WTO Members must obtain DSU authorisation following recourse to dispute settlement. In granting the aid to its domestic producers, however, the Community is not suspending any concessions or obligations towards Korea.</p>
<p>As stated above subsidies are not sanctions in the sense of the Dispute settlement procedure, but permitted policy measures and therefore the recourse to Dispute Settlement can in no way be seen as limiting the normal rights and obligations of Members under the WTO agreement.</p>
<p>Legal consequences of the adoption of the Regulation</p>
<p>As explained above the Proposal is compatible with WTO law. There are, therefore, no particular consequences with regard to the WTO. As for questions of legality under Community law, the Member of the Commission in charge of Competition will address these during the debate on the Proposal in the plenary session of the Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0854"></a>

<p>Payment of the salaries of the officials and other servants of the European Communities is governed by the Staff Regulations, in particular by Article 17 of Annex VII, the first paragraph of which lays down that:</p>
<p>“Payment shall be made to each official at the place and in the currency of the country where he carries out his duties.”</p>
<p>This text is applicable in all countries to which European officials are posted. It thus applies in Brussels, and also in Luxembourg and all the other places of employment of European Union staff. This is why officials are required to have a bank account in the country in which they carry out their duties, so that their salary can be paid into it.</p>
<p>It should nevertheless be noted that within this regulatory framework, members of staff are still free to use the bank of their choice, which means that it is perfectly possible for officials working in Luxembourg, for example, to use the services of a non-Luxembourgish bank, provided the chosen bank has a branch in the Grand Duchy. At present, 229 different banks are established in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission would like to point out that under the terms of Article 17(2) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, European officials have the possibility of transferring a limited portion of their salary to a bank in a Member State of the European Union other than the country where they are employed.</p>
<p>In relation to competition law, the question of the honourable Member does not disclose issues which would demonstrate, prima facie, the existence of potential breaches of the provisions of the EC Treaty. The two relevant treaty provisions are Article 81, which relates to agreements between economic operators, and Article 82 which relates to abuses of a dominant position by economic operators. Retail banking services are, by their nature limited in variety, consisting of savings, loans, investments and payment services. The banks compete primarily on interest rates charged, the level of fees, and the quality of services. It is common practice for banks in Luxembourg and elsewhere to offer the same or similar banking services and the similarity of services would not, of itself, indicate the existence of a cartel-type agreement or of concerted practice which would fall within the Scope of Article 81.</p>
<p>There is, meanwhile, no evidence of any abuse of a dominant position by the banks in Luxembourg.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
