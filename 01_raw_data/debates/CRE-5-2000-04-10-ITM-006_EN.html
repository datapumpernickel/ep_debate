<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Staes (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, practice has shown that scandals and crises can have a cleansing effect and can help improve legislation. This is most certainly the case for all legislation related to food safety, either directly or indirectly. There are ample examples to prove this. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now more than 20 years, for example, since the discovery of the presence of female sex hormones in jars of baby food led directly to the hormone directives being issued in 1981 and 1985 and revised in 1988. Another example is the clenbuterol scandal which led to the slaughter of more than 15 000 calves in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1988 and which brought about a change in the original legislation of the hormone directives in 1996. In Flanders, where I come from, we now have what I would term, without hesitation, the strictest national hormone legislation in Europe following a whole series of attacks on meat inspectors and the murder of the devoted veterinary surgeon, Karel Van Noppen. </p>
<p class="contents">Scandals can have a cleansing effect. This is also evident today as we scrutinise the amendment to Directive 95/53 at second reading. Once again, this amendment has been prompted by a minor scandal, namely the importing of citrus pulp from Brazil contaminated with dioxin. Citrus pulp is used as a feed for dairy cows and this is how dioxin ended up in milk for public consumption. The authorities in Baden-Württemberg discovered this, got the ball rolling and established that between December 1997 and February 1998, a total of nearly 106 000 tonnes of contaminated pulp entered the European Union. The scandal taught us that the Commission did not have the means to act forcefully in emergencies. As a result, the Commission presented, at the request of the Member States, a proposal to amend the present directive on 4 November 1998. As early as 16 December of that same year, Parliament assented to this proposal without tabling one single amendment. After the Treaty of Amsterdam came into effect, the Commission immediately changed the legal basis of 100 A to 152. On 15 November last, the Council laid down the present common position. The Council made a few editorial changes, which were not a problem for us at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. What does cause a problem for us, however, is the way in which the Council has robbed the Commission of the ability to act immediately in case of an emergency. </p>
<p class="contents">I will have to put my technical hat on for a moment and mention the tangle of comitology legislation because, since the Commission proposal has been submitted, comitology legislation has been changed and, from now on, Council Decision 1999/468 applies. This legislation offers us various procedures for transferring the powers of the Council to the Commission. Today, we should focus on Articles 5 and 6 of the Council Decision. Article 5 provides for a regulatory procedure, Article 6 for a safeguard procedure. The original Commission proposal, as it was approved by our Parliament at first reading, was clearly written in the spirit of the existing safeguard procedure. The Council would now like to do away with it in its common position and replace it by the regulatory procedure. It should, however, be clear to all MEPs that the Commission cannot act independently according to this latter procedure and must always seek permission from the Council. After the citrus pulp scandal, the Member States themselves requested that the Commission should act. I am of the opinion that we should give the Commission the opportunity to act swiftly. The four amendments which have been tabled aim to ensure that Article 6 of comitology legislation, i.e. the safeguard procedure, can be applied. The Commission will then be able to act immediately in cases of emergency and can then, for example, suspend the importing of products which would harm public and animal health. The Council will then have 30 days to change, supplement or even reverse this decision. If the Council fails to act during these 30 days, the measures enacted by the Commission will then lapse. I believe that this is good working practice – so far, the Council has never abused this kind of power – and it therefore deserves our support, against the wishes of the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">We should all bear in mind that this dossier is only an intermediate step. On the day my report was approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the European Commission submitted a new proposal to amend Directive 95/53/EC. It immediately drew lessons from the dioxin crisis. If Parliament and the Council adopt the same line as the Commission, a whole chapter will be devoted to further developing the safeguard clause and animal feed will come under a rapid system. In fact, these matters are included in the White Paper and have helped the Commission keep its initial promises on the White Paper with regard to food safety. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am in favour of adopting the four amendments tomorrow and thus giving the Commission our full support. We should join forces with the Commission against the Council and move towards a conciliation procedure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaß (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, in recent years the numerous problems and crises in the area of animal nutrition have sadly brought home to us the importance of official animal nutrition inspections. The rapporteur, Mr Staes, has mentioned some here.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that animal feedingstuffs are the first link in the food chain which ends with humans, and animal feedingstuffs must therefore be safe. BSE and dioxin are only the best known watchwords in this area, which repeatedly make many in the European Union flinch and ask questions to which we, as those with political responsibility, must provide answers. Such questions as: what advantage is there in the internal market if it can lead to unchecked dangers? Who is protecting us and who is providing the safeguards? Europe has a responsibility and a duty in this regard: we are obliged to manage the internal market, which we have created and which we all want, so that risks, not least to the life and well-being of our citizens and consumers, are kept to a minimum, with the aim of eventually eliminating them altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendment of Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition is intended to create a legal basis for a harmonised procedure for checking documents and inspecting goods from third countries. With the consent of these countries, it will also be possible to carry out on-the-spot inspections. This is justified because anyone who wants to trade with us must meet our conditions and supply safe goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the Commission proposal, which Parliament approved at first reading without amendments, the Council has now made amendments to its common position which we do not wish to support. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is now submitting four amendments in plenary to Mr Staes’s report. This report has been adopted unanimously in committee and will therefore be supported by all groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Commission proposal has thus been readopted by us. We consider that it is absolutely imperative that in urgent cases we can act rapidly. Unfortunately, experience shows that safety is not created by good rules alone, but that it also requires an inspection system with the necessary powers of access which can act rapidly and, if need be, impose effective sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must be given the necessary powers here as guardian of the treaties. This is why, in the Environment Committee, the European People’s Party supported the amendment of Article 9a of the directive for official animal nutrition inspections, which grants the European Commission the right of initiative in cases of acute danger, empowering them to independently initiate measures in line with the severity of the grievance and within the framework of proportionality. The Council is then obliged, within 30 days, to process these measures, to validate them and to legitimise or, if necessary, reject them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we need a new committee; we already have the permanent animal nutrition committee. In Germany we have a saying which runs: "when I don’t know what to do next, I appoint a committee". Too many committees cause delays and, ultimately, confusion. We must use the existing facilities and use them efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and the internal market can only exist if they are also accepted by the citizens and the consumers. For this they need confidence, and confidence only comes through openness and transparency. The scandals which we have all discussed show that transparency and openness are becoming more and more important. The Member States, the Council and the European Commission must look upon one another as natural partners which support one another and work together constructively to protect citizens and consumers in a manner which engenders confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must sincerely thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and balanced report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I listened to him and hope that what he said is right. He is evidently more optimistic than I am. I do not really think that crises have a purifying effect. If crises were to have a purifying effect, then Agriculture Ministers would have rather more understanding than they evidently do. Once again we are sitting and standing in this Parliament at a time when we are, for the most part, agreed among ourselves and with the Commission, whilst the person with whom we do not agree, namely the Council representative, is absent. Such is life! It would be nice if he could be made aware of this, but that is probably unlikely.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, and also Mrs Klaß, who has just spoken, have pointed out that Parliament allowed the Commission proposal to pass through first reading unamended. This means that the institutions who are not always in agreement were, on this occasion, agreed. And what has the Council learnt from this? It was the Council (and I say this again in all clarity, drawing in part on my own experiences of recent years) which basically got us into the BSE scandal. It was not this Parliament, and only to a very minor extent the Commission. It was the Council of Ministers who tried repeatedly to keep things under wraps. So what has it learnt from the BSE crisis? Has it learnt that it is better to be transparent? Has it learnt that it is better to permit safeguard options and safeguard clauses? Has it learnt that rapid action is needed? It has learnt none of these things! It has submitted to us a common position in which the option to have a safeguard clause will actually be taken away from the Commission. It will not have the option to get involved quickly and unbureaucratically on the basis of safeguard clauses. It will also not have the option to make unannounced on-the-spot inspections. It will not be in a position to act quickly. And it will also not need to inform the European Parliament, nor will it need to publish any inspection reports lest, heaven forbid, the public finds out something which worries it. It is better to leave things in the hands of the Agriculture Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see the Council representative writing busily and I hope that this will also be passed on to the Presidency and the other members of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I am sorry if I am not being very amiable at the moment, and particularly with my cold I would much rather be mellow, but the fact is I am not. I consider this common position to be scandalous! It is we who have worked for untainted animal feedingstuffs in recent years, we who established that we got BSE because animal feedingstuffs were mixed in a way in which they should never have been mixed, we who established that there just happens to be dioxin in the peel of oranges and other fruits and that we have it in our animal feed, we who established that sewage sludge has no place in animal feedingstuffs, we who established that hormones should not accelerate growth and do not belong in animal feedingstuffs, we who established that there is no place for antibiotics, nor cough medicines for calves – we have established all these things; my goodness, I am making more agricultural policy, and I come from the constituency of Berlin, which is a purely urban constituency, than my voters can imagine, because it is consumer protection policy – and if we know all of this, then what is the Council learning from it?</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again we are providing an example here right across all the groups, the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, who has just spoken for her group, and me for my group, of how the institutions work closely together. We support, Mr Byrne, the fact that you will have the opportunities which you need in the Commission in Brussels, for example via the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, that will enable you to carry out rapid inspections and take safeguard measures, so that we are actually able to say to consumers that we genuinely care about safe food, and safe feedingstuffs and animal nutrition inspections are the first step in all this. I thank you for the fact that you will obviously now be able to table a motion for the primary inspection of European Union products, not just, as in this instance, products from third countries. It only makes sense if we prevent this in unison and only then, Commissioner, does the White Paper on food safety, which you have presented, also make sense. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, we will actually slap the Council of Ministers in the face by unanimously affirming the rapporteur’s four amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The important thing, then, is to thank the Commission, and our rapporteur, Mr Staes, for having finally made sense of the White Paper presented by Romano Prodi, which included a chapter on the food chain and animal feedingstuffs. Animals are just the first link in the chain which leads ultimately to human beings. But our impression is that the Council does not see this. The Council does not appear to see that, after the dioxin crisis, every day since the start of the year there have been cases of mad cows just about everywhere in Europe. The Council does not therefore see what we have seen, which is that as a follow-up to European legislation it is necessary to have structures to monitor and take fast action in the event of a problem. </p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the forthcoming establishment of the European health authority, it would therefore be advisable to allocate this body real resources in order to enable fast detection and thus prevent contagion. It would also be advisable that all animal feed industry operators should sign proper specifications with the competent health authorities that aim to reduce accidents as much as possible and that accept certain thresholds, making it possible to take any additive raw material or animal feedingstuff components out of circulation, and thus helping to restore consumer confidence.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly appreciate the good collaboration with Parliament in this case. Already at first reading, Parliament fully supported the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal aims at improving control measures in the field of animal nutrition. It intends to harmonise inspection procedures for all products imported from third countries. In 1998, the detection of dioxin in some raw materials imported into the Community showed the need for a legal basis to permit the Commission when confronted by a serious risk to public health to adopt safeguard measures on products from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also extends the legal basis to carry out on-the-spot inspections, both in Member States and in third countries. I have to say that I was surprised by the Council's rejection of the Commission proposal for the safeguard clause and by the introduction of a committee procedure that will not guarantee that a prompt decision is taken in the event of a serious risk to human or animal health. As a matter of fact, the dioxin contamination has clearly shown how important rapid action is, in particular when a danger spreads from the feed to the food chain. I should also highlight the fact that similar provisions already exist in food and veterinary legislation and there is no evidence of misuse of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, although not opposed to most of the amendments made by the Council, strongly rejected the Council amendment concerning the safeguard procedure. Council has denied the possibility for the Commission to take immediate action in emergency cases without consulting Member States beforehand. The possibility for the Commission situations to react quickly in emergency cases even before consulting Member States is a landmark question. The discussion in the present case constitutes an important precedent for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the dioxin crisis of May 1999, the Commission announced legislative acts to improve the legal provisions regulating feed safety. In the recent proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council adopted on 21 March, the Commission introduced the same safeguard clause concerning feedingstuffs produced within the European Union. Consequently, this question will also be relevant for several measures on feedingstuffs which are of vital importance and which are announced in the White Paper on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I can fully accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, and 4 by which Parliament reintroduces the original provision on safeguard procedures. Although it is not so important as the other amendments, I can also accept Amendment No 3 regarding the carrying out of on-the-spot inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the plenary's support for the amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I will press once more on the Council the strong case for supporting the proposal's original provisions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
