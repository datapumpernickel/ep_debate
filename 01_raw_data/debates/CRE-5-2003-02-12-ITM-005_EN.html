<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for me to emphasise how crucial the next few days are going to be for the situation in Iraq. There is now a common awareness that time is running out and the view is being expressed that political decisions are being anticipated by events and developments, which are taking on a momentum of their own which may well inevitably result in open conflict with Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say that I do not subscribe to this view. To my mind nothing, least of all war, is a foregone conclusion. There is always room to stay calm and maintain peace, and politicians have a duty to do everything they can and to exhaust every possible avenue before deciding to go to war. You all know the ins and outs of the Iraqi crisis; there is no need for me to describe it in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to round up a number of recent developments. One, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council held on 27 January, setting out a number of principles behind the policy of the Fifteen on Iraq. Two, the Presidency’s demarche to Iraqi missions in Athens, Brussels and New York, making it perfectly clear that Baghdad urgently needs to comply fully, immediately and unconditionally with Security Council Resolution 1441. Three, the American Secretary of State Colin Powell’s presentation to the Security Council on 5 February of evidence that Iraq still has and is continuing to hide weapons of mass destruction. Four, President Bush’s announcement of a new Security Council resolution authorising the use of violence. Five, the recent decision by Baghdad to allow a number of scientists to be examined in private by the international inspectors and to allow flights to use Iraqi airspace and, finally, the new progress report by the international inspectors on their work in Iraq, due on 14 February. These events which I have picked out are not particularly encouraging. However, the latest moves by Baghdad do, I think, give us cause to hope that, provided the message is clear, there may be room for it to comply fully with Resolution 1441.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to emphasise that the Presidency’s basic priority is to work towards a peaceful resolution of this dispute and we hope that efforts by the United Nations will have positive results. We believe that Iraq must respect and duly apply the Security Council resolutions and we believe that the Iraqi crisis is determined by three basic parameters: respect for the international legal order and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of each country, respect for human rights and greater peace, stability and security in the area. It is precisely within the framework of these parameters that the Presidency is hoping to give Europe a strong, united voice, and it will make every possible effort to deescalate the crisis and find a peaceful solution. That is why the General Affairs Council was so keen to distil the European Union’s common principles in its conclusions on 27 January, in which it stresses that: first, the European Union’s goal remains the complete disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; secondly, the Iraqi authorities must provide the inspectors, without delay, with all the necessary information and must engage in active cooperation with the international inspectors; thirdly, the work of the international inspectors has our full confidence and support and we welcome their intention to continue and intensify their operations; fourthly, this is Iraq’s final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully and Iraq must comply fully with Resolution 1441; fifthly, the responsibility of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">These core conclusions were the main thrust of our demarche to the Iraqi missions in Athens, Brussels and New York. We formulated a common approach and codified the main points of that approach, which are complete disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, exhausting all avenues for resolving the problem peacefully, full compliance with Security Council resolutions, active cooperation on the part of Iraq, support for the work of the inspectors and respect for the role of the Security Council. Obviously, there is no need for me to point out that if Iraq engages in any further obstruction, it will be responsible for the consequences and subsequent developments, given its delaying tactics and total indifference towards compliance with the Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, one question that arises is the significance of all these recent events in connection with Iraq to an internal dimension of the European Union. I refer to the common foreign policy and defence policy. There has been a great deal of debate over recent years and recent months and a great many stands have been taken by important public figures and governments, by Europe, by the European Parliament, by independent think tanks, about the importance of developing the common foreign policy and defence policy in the Union. The time has come when action will show if all these ambitious stands have any real substance or if that is not the case at present. We hope it will not be the latter. We also believe that this is a difficult process and will of course take a long time; on the other hand, however, Europe needs to take a number of decisions today. It needs to safeguard its unity, it needs to safeguard its role on the international stage, a role which may not be steeped in military power and high-profile leadership, but which has achieved eminent results over the last fifty years. To underestimate them is to misinterpret history.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the chief international weapons inspectors, Dr Hans Blix and Dr El Baradei, returned from recent contacts with Baghdad with a degree of optimism. They are due to submit their next progress report to the Security Council on 14 February and we await it with serious and evident interest. The Presidency has decided to convene an extraordinary European Council at the beginning of the following week, on 17 February, in order to assess the situation and try and bring about greater convergence on the Iraqi crisis. A great deal will depend on what the inspectors have to say in their report. If it is at all positive, this may affect the overall situation accordingly, whereas if there are still serious unanswered issues or questions, a major effort will have to be made to convince Baghdad that it needs to comply absolutely and definitively with Resolution 1441 if it wants to avoid war. However, either way, Europe will need to take an ordered approach to the developments outlined and to formulate a common position which will consolidate its credibility and allow it to play a fundamental role. President Prodi referred this morning to the importance of this process. As things stand today, at this particular juncture, it will not be an easy task, but it is a necessary task. I trust that the common values that unite us will make it both easier and more feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our expectations of the summit on 17 February? We expect a sober appraisal of all the assessments presented, we expect a considered approach to the repercussions of any decisions taken on Iraq, we expect confirmation that the European Union has no intention of abandoning diplomacy and policy as tools for resolving international crises before until every possible avenue has been exhausted, we expect support for the role of the United Nations as the basic institution and system in international relations, we expect a decisive stand on the application of UN resolutions by Iraq, we expect a bold decision that Europe as a concept and our common foreign and security policy will not be marginalized the first time its credibility is seriously tested. We also expect a decision on every initiative in every direction which might help bring about peace, deescalate the crisis, disarm Iraq and avoid unnecessary suffering. Generally speaking, we are looking for a reason to believe that Europe can create its own approach and win over its trans-Atlantic partner, the people of the Middle East and public opinion in general, and break the cycle of escalating tension which is giving rise to insecurity, uncertainty and anxiety in large sections of the global system.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, ladies and gentlemen, we need to answer the question of whether or not we can achieve convergence. My reply is that I do not know if we can, but that we must try, we must find a way. And we must exhaust every possible avenue in order to do so. When it comes to Iraq, it is not just issues concerning Iraq, the danger of the use of weapons of mass destruction or the balance of power in the region that are at stake. The credibility of the European Union, its interests, its role and its prospects are at stake. The Greek Presidency considers that these are achievements that must be protected and strengthened. And that applies both to the Fifteen and to the 10 new Member States. We need unity in the European Union. And behind or alongside unity there is solidarity. And solidarity does not just mean the Structural Funds; it is a horizontal concept. If it is undermined, its ramifications will be crucial for everyone in Europe, for each country individually and collectively for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, at this crucial time in the effort to achieve the disarmament of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, and when the risk seems to be increasing that he has still not fully understood the need to disarm, I welcome this opportunity to share with you our views of the situation and the role which Europe should play.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crystal clear is that Iraq needs to cooperate more willingly and intensively both in form and in substance with the inspectors, if war is to be avoided. Some encouraging signs of cooperation emerged recently, as a result of Mr Blix's and Mr El Baradei's mission to Baghdad last weekend. We will have more indications on the extent of Iraq’s cooperation next Friday when the chief inspectors report to the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are about to face another crucial point as regards whether Saddam is ready to disarm or not. Beyond any possible speculation, it is easy to imagine that we will still be in a somewhat unclear situation open to different interpretations. In any case we have to stick to the inspectors' assessment, bearing in mind that war must remain the very last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">The preservation of the UN Security Council's role, and of the primacy of international law, must remain our basis if we want to maintain a credible system able to guarantee peace and security. The recent resolution voted by the European Parliament expressing its full support for a multilateral approach gave a clear message in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As confirmed by recent events, we all know that the Member States have quite diverging views on this issue, and that achieving a common position on this issue is a huge challenge for the European Union. The EU in fact looks weaker and more divided than ever. These differences are not the product of some minor institutional inadequacies in the architecture of the European Union. We already have a High Representative entrusted with the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the European Union. The differences are honest and real, and therefore demonstrate that a more fundamental change is necessary if Europe is to achieve a true Common Foreign and Security Policy. This is a moment of truth. Anything short of qualified majority voting will not be a solution. This lesson should be kept in mind in the present institutional and constitutional debate. In any case the need now for internal clarification is strong, and in this regard we welcome the Presidency initiative calling for an extraordinary summit next Monday, in an attempt to get Europe to speak with one voice, defining the European position in view of the most recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not up to the European Commission to speculate on hypothetical possibilities or the future course of action. Many scenarios are still possible – including the likelihood of a military attack. Yet our major responsibility at this point is to give absolute support to the Security Council. Needless to say, in parallel, each of us needs to work on what to do in case things do not go as we wish.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis. The humanitarian situation in Iraq is already precarious after 20 years of degradation deriving from a long war with Iran, followed by the Gulf War and 10 years of international sanctions. The European Commission, through ECHO, is the largest external donor to Iraq outside the 'Oil for Food Programme' (which is funded with Iraqi money). Over the last ten years ECHO has provided EUR 156 million worth of humanitarian aid to the population in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 2002 ECHO approved a global humanitarian plan of EUR 13 million which focuses on the health and water and sanitation sectors in order to complement the 'oil for food' programme. The operations from this funding will run until summer 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2003, ECHO has earmarked EUR 15 million to continue this established – more or less 'normal' – humanitarian operation in Iraq. It is estimated that over 7 million Iraqi people benefit from ECHO’s assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Eventual military action against Iraq would further worsen the living conditions of the Iraqi people, and in particular of those of the most vulnerable civilian population groups. A military attack might have humanitarian fall-outs in the whole region, with movements of refugees and also quite possibly negative consequences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is going through studies and analyses right now, looking at contingency measures in case of a conflict. ECHO is maintaining very regular and close contacts with all key humanitarian partners and notably with the UN agencies: OCHA, UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO, WFP, the Red Cross – both the ICRC and the IFRC – and NGOs in the region, and it is also important to maintain close contact with UNHRA.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO has recently sent two missions to Iraq and neighbouring countries in order to assess the current humanitarian situation and security measures for staff, and to monitor the preparations by different humanitarian agencies in the event of a conflict in Iraq. This is in order to be able to react quickly to any change in the humanitarian situation. These missions also looked into the security measures envisaged for relief workers and humanitarian operations - evacuation plans and other such difficult issues.</p>
<p class="contents">A strict separation must be maintained between military action and humanitarian assistance to make sure that delivery of aid is possible. Humanitarian assistance has its own rationale and objectives. It is based on the needs of the civilian populations and allocated solely in proportion to these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Neutrality and impartiality are crucial for having access to populations and a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for the security of relief workers. Delivery of humanitarian assistance by or assisted by armed forces is not desirable. It should in any case be closely coordinated and decided by the humanitarian organisations which have the necessary mandate, know-how and experience. These are the guiding principles for our assessments and for our possible action in the area of humanitarian aid if a conflict breaks out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though Europe is a sad sight to behold, there is an opportunity in every crisis, and so we should not be saying that a common European foreign and security policy makes no sense, or that it has failed; rather, we have to redouble our efforts in order that our foreign and security policy may indeed be shared by all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Any such policy must be founded on clear analysis, that analysis being that it is Saddam Hussein who is the problem, at the head of a regime of terror founded upon crime, terror and murder. Commissioner, Iraq is in fact a rich country, but its dictator has plundered it. So anyone who sees the USA as the problem is confusing cause and effect. It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our group is of the very decided opinion that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein are a menace to the region and imperil the peace of the world. It is under the UN's aegis that disarmament must take place; it must be peaceful if at all possible, and, if that proves impossible, military means must be employed. Responsibility for whether it happens peacefully or by military force lies solely with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us just remind ourselves of the chronology of events. At the heart of disunity within Europe and across the Atlantic is the self-isolation of the Federal Republic of Germany, for which its present Chancellor must bear responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The German Federal Chancellor, by isolating Germany – whatever reasons he may have had for doing so – during a federal election campaign, in which he said, ‘No matter what the UN does, we will never take part in it!’, took the pressure off Saddam Hussein; he acted in an anti-European way, for one needs to speak first to the Europeans before coming out with utterances with such implications at public election rallies. He gave a complete repeat performance in the elections to provincial assemblies, but it brought him no success in terms of votes.</p>
<p class="contents">We then come to the second chronological element, the Franco-German declaration at the celebrations of the Elysée Treaty. Speaking in terms of political psychology – and I do so for the benefit of our French friends in particular – this gave the false impression of the French position now being identical to the German one. The French were always much more sophisticated, but that was the political impression that was given.</p>
<p class="contents">Then came the statement by the eight states. I am speaking for our group when I tell you that we regret this way of going about things, which bypasses the Community process, and that we cannot endorse it. In essence, the statement does meet with our approval, however. It was also necessary in order that we might send out a signal of friendship to our American partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are now faced with the question of what is to happen next. I recommend that we give thought to how we understand our relationship with America. If we understand European unity in terms of opposition to the United States of America, then we are building Europe upon sand. Rather than that, we want a partnership between the European Union and the United States of America, a partnership founded on cooperation between equals and on multilateral partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, of course, things that we demand of our American partners. We do not think it right that the American administration under President Bush tends to see the USA's relationship with Europe in bilateral terms, in other words, Washington and Paris, Washington and London, Washington and Rome, Washington and Madrid, Washington and Berlin and so on. We have to define the relationship between the USA and Europe in such a way that Europeans can take common action and also in such a way that the European institutions are the American administration's partner in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For if we do not build this partnership of equals with America, that also goes against America's interests, as we now see, as European disunity has consequences for the North Atlantic Alliance. The American administration and President Bush should also recognise the value of European unity, which is also in the interests of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in Europe were to revert to forming axes as we once did, then both our group and I would consider this a perilous road to go down. Just imagine – and I will not use the word ‘axis’ – that there were to be, as seems at present to be taking shape, something like two common positions, with Paris, Berlin and Moscow on the one side and London, Rome, Madrid and Washington on the other. If Europe were to present itself thus to the world, it would be a nightmarish sight. That is why we have to act within the framework of the Community. All the things we are doing now have to be done on a Community basis.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say just a word or two on the subject of Turkey. If our Turkish partners ask us to involve them in planning and to supply them with weapons for their defence, I do not believe that we can refuse such a request, such an entreaty. I hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My wish for the Presidency of the Council next Monday is for three things to be achieved: a European common position, the bridging of the deep gulf between us and the United States, and the sending of a signal to the Iraqi dictator that he must disarm. It is to be hoped he will be brought to do this by peaceful means and under the guidance of the United Nations!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest achievement of European construction is the fact that for half a century we have broken the pattern of war, replacing it with peace and a shared destiny. The European peoples do not just co-exist in the Union, but we share a destiny in brotherhood and mutual tolerance. And we are still constructing Europe, with difficulties, but the united Europe is not the old Europe of endemic civil wars between us nor the new Europe which was preached by fascism and Nazism. At this time much more unites us than divides us. We all want peace, we are all against bloodthirsty dictators and we all want to see the disappearance of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">In families – and in the Union – there can be moments of tension, but we must be able to overcome them through solidarity and mutual compromise. The approach which can unite Europe is the mandate of the United Nations, respect for international law and the continuation of the inspectors’ work. We are not condemned to war; we must work to give peace a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European Socialist Party support and welcome the correct and timely initiative of President Simitis: we must do everything possible to find a common position and overcome the disagreements within the Council and also with the candidate countries, who are already members of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to correct Mr Poettering on a point relating to the isolation of the current German government. I would like to remind him that the first government of the German Federal Republic since the war to fully assume its responsibilities in the international field was the Socialist/Green coalition of Chancellor Schröder. Before that there was nothing more than passivity. Therefore the Schröder government is not isolated, it is in good company.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of our responsibilities as the European Parliament, we were significantly united in the resolution approved in January by a large majority – from which, curiously, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats withdrew at the last moment, after having negotiated it. My Group would ask the President to use the resolution as a guide for his speech on Monday, in which we urge him to make a solemn appeal and to insist on the need for the United Nations Security Council resolutions to be fully applied and complied with, to express opposition to any unilateral action and to consider that a preventive attack does not conform to the United Nations Charter, and that he also urge the Council and the Member States to take the initiative of proposing to the International Criminal Court that the Iraqi leader is responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it is important to point out that at this time we must not anticipate events. The military machine must not be allowed to take on its own dynamic, leading us into war, the war is still avoidable and the United Nations Organisation is still necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The geopolitical effects of action adopted unilaterally outside the framework of the Security Council would be catastrophic not only for Iraq but for the whole of the Middle East, with unpredictable consequences. We must not forget that Iraq, despite everything, is still a secular and religiously pluralist regime, which is important in view of the situation of increasing fundamentalism. We have heard the Commission’s report on the humanitarian issue – and I thank Commissioner Nielson – which also points out the risks involved in this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore carry on supporting the inspectors, insisting that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the Security Council without allowing it to make any excuse or evasive response. In this context, the inspection chiefs have noted that it is a positive step that Iraq has agreed to allow surveillance flights and is cooperating. At the moment, the international community has put is faith in the inspectors. They must continue their work and we must support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, since 11 September we have insisted on the need to coordinate efforts with the United States and we have expressed our solidarity with this great country in the fight against the threat of international terrorism. This is not only a result of our historic gratitude and friendship, arising from the role of the United States in favour of European democracy in the two world wars. The issue today is not the extent to which we are friends on paper with the United States. We are in disagreement – and this must be said – over the doctrine of preventive war. We are even more in disagreement and we totally reject the unfortunate comments of the Secretary of State, Mr Rumsfeld, in Munich last week, insulting a European country and not explaining the thing he should explain: why, as Secretary of the Reagan administration, he went to Baghdad to give weapons of mass destruction to his then ally, Saddam Hussein. This must be explained.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying that we are friends and allies who behave like genuine friends: we say what we think. We are allies of the United States as a result of shared historical responsibilities and principles. We must fight to give peace and hope a chance. We are not condemned to the disaster of war and mass destruction, and we call on President-in-Office Simitis to speak on behalf of a Europe with one harmonious voice next Monday.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, it seems hard to believe that the disunity of the world community as a whole, and the European Union in particular, could reach a lower point than when the 'gang of 8' prime ministers signed their ill-judged letter backing the USA on Iraq. But we are now plumbing new depths of public bickering, with the splits spreading from the UN and the EU to include Nato. Anarchy reigns in our international institutions, and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to prevent these fissures becoming a chasm, our governments must draw back from their quarrels, return to first principles and move forward on the basis of what unites them. The United Nations, Nato, the European Communities – these institutions have served us well, and they are too valuable to be abandoned in the face of current differences of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">And if that requires America to show a little patience, that is no bad thing. Public opinion in the US is less united than President Bush pretends – over a third still want a new UN vote to authorise any conflict, and almost a quarter do not want US troops to be sent to Iraq at all. When a former president pleads for patience, and leading Democrat Senator John Kerry hopes for an America: 'where military might is not clouded by our need for oil', is there really bipartisan backing for President Bush, to give him the credibility he needs?</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy can be difficult, and building support for a position often takes time and good arguments. But it is better to take the time to do it and get it right than to launch into a course of action, half cock. Liberals therefore congratulate the Greek Presidency on convening next Monday's meeting. We trust that all governments will attend. They should come prepared to listen and to seek common ground, not simply to repeat their well-known positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's leaders too should take care not to overplay their hand. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is rightly following the maxim that they should prepare for the worst while continuing to hope for the best, by making contingency plans for a possible refugee crisis. As a collective defence organisation, Nato should be guided by the same principle, and it is the responsibility of every Nato country to support Turkey's request for assistance under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the reservations he expressed last time, Dr Hans Blix's report on Friday will carry particular significance. Those who call for more inspectors should heed his remark that: 'the principal problem is not the number of inspectors but rather the active cooperation of the Iraqi side'. At the same time, if he reports progress towards active cooperation, the US and Britain should give the UN process the space to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Amid all this gloom, perhaps we can take comfort from one ray of hope. When the inspectors report again on Friday, the eyes of the world will again be focused on the UN Security Council. It will be the body which represents the ultimate authority of the international community and considers Iraq's fate. We should welcome the fact that the UN, established to preserve world peace, is at the heart of the process. Let us keep it there.</p>

The attitude which it will shortly be taking towards the prospect of a new Gulf War will be crucial in defining our vision of Europe and our conception of the world. It will have to shoulder its responsibilities in circumstances which will leave no room for one of those woolly consensuses to which, all too often, we have become accustomed thanks to the common foreign and security policy. Hemmed in by the pressure from the Bush administration’s call to arms on one side and the demands of European public opinion, which is massively opposed to it, on the other, there can be no middle way: we shall have to choose.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, what message should Parliament be sending to the European Council? Its resolution of 30 January was clear on the essential points, and is still entirely in line with our current view. Allow me to add a few points drawn from the moving experiences of the delegation of over thirty Members of the European Parliament, drawn from eleven countries and four political groups, which has just returned from Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I should like to brush aside the insidious remarks of those who have tried to portray us as being under an obligation to Saddam Hussein. On the contrary, even in the opinion of the journalists who were present, ours was the most independent delegation of any in recent times. After all, our links with the democratic opposition to the Baghdad regime and our absolute rejection of Saddam Hussein are sufficiently well known to enable me not to waste any more time on this unfounded, petty accusation. I hope, in this respect, that the European Parliament’s ad hoc delegation to Iraq will not stop in New York but will continue to its final destination, Baghdad. Our delegation, by contrast, will proceed rapidly to New York and Washington, where the anti-war movement is growing day by day, reaching right to the heart of Congress.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, what did we see and hear in Iraq, and what collective conclusions have we drawn? First of all there are the accumulated impressions and observations of the life of the population, from Baghdad and its most deprived suburbs to Basra, in the south, and Mosul, in the north, with its enormous camp for Turkish Kurd refugees. Everywhere, poverty is on a massive scale, and there has been spectacular social regression according to those who knew Iraq before the Gulf War, and even more so compared with what the country was like before the war with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no longer an economy, apart from oil, exports of which have fallen by half due to lack of investment. In rural areas, all activities have collapsed, desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up. UN agents are sounding the alarm: one third of the population is suffering from chronic malnutrition, and one third of children are seriously underweight. Infant mortality has exploded in the last ten years. More than eight thousand schools are in ruins and need repairs that would now be too costly. Students have no books, and teachers earn the equivalent of a few euros per month.</p>
<p class="contents">In Iraq today, people do not live, they try to survive thanks to the meagre assistance provided by the 'oil for food' programme, which is financed using revenue from hydrocarbons and is managed directly by the government. This is the result of twelve years of embargo, and it is absolutely essential to put an end to this unbearable collective punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to get an idea of the memories left in people’s minds by the war, by going, as we did, to the so-called demilitarised zone in the south of the country. There, the heaps of countless wrecked tanks, cars, jeeps and buses remind us that, in the final hours of the conflict, even as the Iraqi troops were falling back, a final bombardment claimed more than thirty thousand needless victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, now, the predominant feelings are of fatalism, resignation, and silent traumatisation. A new war would undoubtedly lead to the catastrophic disruption of supplies of food and water. It would be a humanitarian disaster. In our view this reason alone is enough to rule out absolutely any new recourse to war, whatever the circumstances. There is also another reason, however, namely the risk of destabilising the whole region, starting with the Middle East, where the Palestinians are currently facing one of the worst situations in their history.</p>
<p class="contents">The other striking experience in our view was our meeting with the spokesman of the inspectors and the director of the UN inspection centre in Baghdad. What they told us makes good sense. First of all, as long as the inspectors are present, it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons. Then again, it is completely impossible to complete such a mission in the space of two months, but given time, resources and the cooperation of the authorities, it will be possible to achieve the international community’s objective, namely to ensure that Iraq no longer constitutes a threat to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we stated publicly, on the spot, that in our view, at the present time, the only chance for Iraq lies in complete cooperation with the United Nations inspectors. This is also why the Franco-German proposals seeking to strengthen the resources of the inspectors now constitute, in our view, the only acceptable outcome of this crisis, ruling out any military action.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the position that our group expects Member States to adopt, especially those among them who sit on the UN Security Council, particularly if they have the power of veto, which if necessary they should use if that is the only way of refusing to sanction the shameful actions of a team which is drunk with power and is currently placing world peace and equilibrium at risk. What credibility would the United Nations be left with if a policy of giving in to the strongest party were to lead a handful of states to violate so cynically the spirit of the UN Charter?</p>
<p class="contents">Next Saturday, throughout the world, a tidal wave without precedent in many countries will rise up and say no to war. We hope that as many Members of the European Parliament as possible will be seen at these demonstrations, because Europe has a duty to say no to an imperial machine, whose new strategic doctrine, as published by the Bush administration on 20 September last, illustrates its nature and its scope, namely the cult of military power, the thirst for domination, the claim to be able to act alone, if necessary, on a preventive basis, in order to achieve objectives which have nothing to do with world security.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the events of 11 September, we said that we were allied but not aligned. This handful of Member State leaders who are ready to divide Europe at a signal from the White House needs to be reminded of this principle. As for the candidate countries, I believe that this is the time to let them know, in all frankness, before the ratification of the accession treaties, that we must be clear about our common ambition: let us not confuse the new Europe with the reform of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">We must keep abreast of European public opinion as it emerges throughout the continent. In the eyes of an increasing number of our fellow citizens, what the United States has gained in power it is losing in confidence, owing to the Messianic and megalomaniac behaviour of its leaders. This situation gives the European Union a historic responsibility, not against America, but against the dangerous desire for hegemony on the part of those who claim, on its behalf, to dictate to the world, only to lead that world into chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, as I said, facing a test of truth. History has not yet been written. Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility.</p>

If the objective really being pursued is that of disarming Iraq, we must strengthen the inspection programme. The inspectors are the alternative to war. If, on the other hand, the objective is first and foremost to topple the Iraqi regime by force, then we must conclude, here and now, as the American Government has done, that the inspection programme has now become pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore confirm, at the Security Council on Friday, that the sole objective of Resolution 1441 is to disarm Iraq. I would remind you that the resolution adopted by the plenary session of the European Parliament on 30 January is clearly in line with this reasoning. This attitude in no way signifies that we accept the dictatorial nature of the Iraqi Government. It signifies that we do not want a change of regime to be brought about by war. That, Mr Poettering, is the attitude of the German Government, and it is not an isolated one: it is also the attitude of the French Government and the Belgian Government, and I hope that next Monday, at the European Council meeting, it will be the unified attitude of the fifteen governments of the Union. Whatever happens, I am proud of the position adopted by these various governments.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned public opinion in Europe, but I should also like to talk, though not at such length as Mr Wurtz, about the fate of the people of Iraq. I too was a member of that delegation of 31 Members. The contact that we had there, both with the authorities of the UN agency and with the NGO officials, have led us unanimously to conclude that after two wars and the current embargo the Iraqi population is at the end of its tether. A new war in Iraq would obviously have catastrophic humanitarian consequences, and this was confirmed to us by all the UN workers whom we met in Baghdad. Is this really how we imagine we are preparing a future for the people of Iraq?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to give some hope back to the people of Iraq, I should like to emphasise, as I already have done and as we already did at the previous plenary session, the need to change the embargo arrangements. Before 11 September 2001, the whole of the international community recognised the negative effects of this embargo, which is helping the dictatorship and keeping the population in a state of dependency while at the same time stifling the Iraqi economy. I propose that, at the same time as we intensify the inspection programme, there should also be a revision of the mandate of the 'oil for food' programme, which would make it possible to buy local products, thereby encouraging the Iraqi economy to make a fresh start, and which would also give responsibility for distributing food rations to the UN World Food Programme.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is an exceptionally important debate. Tensions are certainly rising in an international context. If we are not careful, and if this crisis is badly handled, this will only result in serious and long-term consequences for us all on many fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be tragic if the authority of the United Nations is weakened to a point where it loses international credibility. That is why it is so necessary to guarantee that the United Nations is involved at each and every stage of the developments to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction. International security is best served in a collective sense, via global institutions such as the United Nations. In many ways, it is even more important for smaller Member States to have their security protected by an international organisation such as the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the crux of the issue. There is genuine good will, support and confidence on the part of the people of Europe in the work of the United Nations. In fact, no one would dispute for one moment the professionalism and integrity of the United Nations officials who are officially involved in the inspection missions in Iraq. The United Nations has been involved in the whole process to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations must remain a central player in this ongoing process of disarmament. Any unilateral action in the coming weeks would gravely and seriously damage the authority and credibility of the United Nations as an organisation involved in maintaining international governance in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Weapons inspections must continue as long as the inspectors themselves and the United Nations Security Council believe that they will serve a useful purpose. We all want to see a peaceful solution to this issue by guaranteeing the compliance of the Iraqi Government with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. Saddam Hussein must recognise that the international community wants to resolve this issue by peaceful means. Disarming Saddam Hussein in a peaceful manner is by far the most acceptable and preferable course of action for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">EU governments are meeting next Monday to review the political situation. This meeting is taking place at a time of rising tension between the different European Union states. I certainly hope that this meeting can and will be used to defuse this tension which simply serves no one's interests whatsoever. This meeting will take place only a few days after the next United Nations weapons inspectors' report is published.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to try to secure a common European position on Iraq, notwithstanding the very clear differences in approach to this issue that now exist between the different EU governments. We must all try to approach the next few weeks collectively in a calm and reasoned manner.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to defy the authority of the United Nations as he has sought to in the past. We must not forget that this is a man who brutally abuses the human rights of his people. He has used chemical weapons on his own people; he has invaded Iran and Kuwait and bombed Saudi Arabia and Israel in the past. This is certainly a track record of brutal belligerence. Saddam Hussein needs to be disarmed, and he must recognise that the international community will continue to demand that he does disarm. However, the United Nations must continue to be the organisation that oversees the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1441 or any future resolutions that may be agreed at the UN on this very important and sensitive matter.</p>

In fact, only the current terror regime in Baghdad stands to gain from it. And then we talk about a potential neighbour of the European Union, in view of Turkey’s candidate status. This political option prompts me to put a couple of questions to the Greek Presidency. Has the Council resigned itself to the domestic status quo in Iraq – with all the dangerous consequences this could entail for the nation and the region; or is the Council striving for a better internal and external perspective for Iraq, actively involving Iraq’s very diverse opposition? Sooner or later, a new policy of containment towards Saddam Hussein will do the international community, and therefore the European Union, too, serious harm.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns Turkey’s position with regard to the Kurds in northern Iraq. I presume that Turkey, too, has been invited to next Monday's European crisis deliberations on Iraq. According to international press reports, the candidate countries are also receiving an invitation. Is the Council also intending to raise the Kurdish question, a crucial factor in the Iraq crisis, with Turkey at these deliberations? I assume, Mr President, that the Council is not divided on conserving Iraq’s territorial integrity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That person is Saddam Hussein. That person – I do not know whether it is his evil genius or our or your stupidity – has succeeded in very little time in exposing the European crisis, the Nato crisis and what we hope, at least, will not be a United Nations crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the alternative to war is not, for democrats, the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, that bloodthirsty, cruel dictatorial regime described by many of you as ‘peace’. The alternative is politics, and it is the role of politics to define what kind of peace, what kind of conditions, what kind of rules. Yet, here, there have been no political proposals, apart from a few banalities, and, whether this self-important House likes it or not, the only political proposal currently on the table is for a free, democratic Iraq governed by a transition government under the auspices of the United Nations, which would mastermind the democratic transition for Iraq and the Iraqi people. You see, you are incapable of doing anything except mumbling ‘peace’. And what does that mean, pray? Peace for whom? For the oppressed Iraqis? You will go out in your millions to demonstrate for peace and Arab public opinion will see you as supporting Saddam Hussein, whether you like it or not. If you had taken ‘A free Iraq’ as your slogan, that would have weakened the conflicting arguments and created such a strong position that even Saddam Hussein would have seen the advantages of going into exile. That did not happen, and just look at the chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, at the European Council, this single proposal, which has now been signed by thousands of people, will be the only point of convergence. I believe it can enable us to regain some of our lost dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorism is a running sore, which may flare up if moves are made without the backing of the Security Council. This means that, first, Security Council Resolution 1441 on Iraq needs to be duly applied and I should like to take this opportunity to say that it would be a good day for the international community and the credibility of the United Nations if all its resolutions were applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this international crisis has been provoked by Iraq’s failure to comply with the resolution in question. That is why Saddam Hussein, who has proven how dangerous he is in the past by freely using biological and chemical weapons, including against civilians, needs to cooperate with the international community and give the United Nations inspectors all the information they need on his weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Iraq is being governed as a dictatorship, with no respect for human rights or democracy. The European Parliament has led the way in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms and cannot therefore tolerate this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that we must first exhaust every peaceful and diplomatic means of getting Iraq to comply. International peace and security need to be safeguarded and action taken at international level must not undermine the credibility of the UN or the Security Council. Military action against Iraq must, of course, be the final solution and it must be sanctioned by the international community on the basis of the inspectors’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the international crisis highlights the weakness of the European Union and I think that the Greek Presidency should not only call on the Fifteen to adopt a common position within the CFSP; any common position should, if possible, also include the candidate countries. There must be an end to action which polarises the international community and creates divisions, because the credibility of the Union and of the CFSP will be dealt a mortal blow unless a common line of approach is taken to the problem of Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out. They are also the essential points of the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 30 January, with which you are no doubt well acquainted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take a close look at these four points. The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is not at issue. That, I believe, is something we can all agree on, as, no doubt, we do on support for UNMOVAC and IAEA, that is to say, for the inspectors' attempts to bring all this about in Iraq. Where we will have difficulties, and where it is important that we be clear in our own minds, is with the maintenance of the UN's primacy. That international organisation is in charge of the process and must remain so; it alone is capable of endowing with legitimacy whatever measures will turn out to be necessary in this case. We also have to make clear our opposition to unilateral courses of action and, most certainly, our opposition to a preventive war. The final point that needs to be made is that we must try everything that occurs to us as individuals and groups as a means of averting this war and finding a peaceful solution. There are many possibilities for this. The latest proposals put forward in Europe point in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point I would like to address and one prefatory remark I would like to make in order to make Mr Poettering's speech comprehensible. This House is perhaps not aware that we had elections in Germany on 22 September last year. They were won by Gerhard Schröder and not by Mr Stoiber. That is something with which Mr Poettering cannot yet come to terms, and he believes that his speeches in this Parliament will bring about Mr Schröder's downfall in Germany. He can carry on believing that, but I do not believe that this House is particularly interested. We have quite different problems with which we should be getting to grips.</p>
<p class="contents">One of those problems is that with the candidate countries. I think we have to make abundantly clear to the future members of the European Union the importance of the principle of solidarity, which is in every respect equal to the Copenhagen criteria and all the other technocratic criteria by which – so to speak – their readiness for accession was measured. I do not find it acceptable for these states, at this point in time, to make affirmations of solidarity, although I too welcome solidarity with the United States of America and have nothing against it. What is of primary importance, though, is solidarity with the European Union, which is to accept them as Member States and has made massive efforts in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great deal is being said at them moment about Europe being divided. I believe that never has Europe been so united at the level of its peoples as it is today in rejecting this war in Iraq. Opinion in all the Member States and in the candidate countries is between 80% and 90% opposed to war.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And I wonder how Mr Poettering, whom I have known for twenty years now, can make himself so remote from the opinions of his own people.</p>

We are quarrelling with each other. We are quarrelling with the United States. It is incredibly tragic to see how the splendid ambitions of a common European foreign policy are slowly crumbling.</p>
<p class="contents">Disagreement in NATO’s Security Council is genuinely unfortunate now that we no doubt need so badly to stand together The only winner as a result of this disagreement is Saddam Hussein. The losers are the EU, NATO, the UN and relations with the United States, which are being considerably weakened. The rift may have incredibly serious consequences, and the different initiatives now coming out of the various capital cities will be of no use if they are not coordinated. Competition does not help in these circumstances. Rather, cooperation is required. As a passionate Europhile, I am ashamed of the EU’s impotence.</p>
<p class="contents">The net is closing in on Saddam Hussein. The world’s patience is running out. It is he, and he only, that can prevent war. It is Iraq, and not the UN, that must demonstrate that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country. Resolution 1441 is crystal clear on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">On Friday, Dr Hans Blix and the inspectors will produce a new report. In his latest report, Doctor Blix points to the Iraqi dictator’s insufficient willingness to cooperate. Friday’s report will therefore be very important. If Doctor Blix and his colleagues need more time, they must be given it. It is the Security Council that must then decide what is to happen. The anti-UN attitude adopted by the German Chancellor is deeply regrettable. This is not a matter of German domestic politics, but a matter concerning the whole of Europe. The UN needs our support at this difficult time. Instead of having a go at the candidate countries, Mr Sakellariou, a little self-criticism would be in order.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you luck at Monday’s meeting and with your attempt to unite the Member States.

<p class="contents">There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq. It is a country devastated by sanctions, with teachers and university professors earning as little as USD 10 per month and 3 000 children a month dying of malnutrition and the lack of essential medicine. If war finally breaks out there, the only means through which the country presently survives - the Oil for Food programme – will come to an end and throw the country into massive chaos. It will create 900 000 refugees – those are not my figures, they are figures produced by the United Nations – who will flee, not to America, but to countries in the Middle East and Europe, creating an unprecedented humanitarian aid disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">If the human tragedy unfolding before us can be resolved peacefully – and I am heartened by the initiative of several countries now, calling for more staff resources and more time for the weapons inspectors and for the possible intervention of a UN peace keeping force – then surely that is the only alternative before us. If weapons inspectors can avoid the deaths of half a million civilians, then that is surely the only logical course of action we can consider.</p>
<p class="contents">This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq. I visited a Kurdish refugee camp in Makhtur in northern Iraq, where 10 000 refugees from Turkey are captives in their own camp. They are allowed to leave the camp only under strict surveillance. The latest understanding between America and Turkey, ceding control over the whole of the devolved Kurdish territory in the north of Iraq, is a nightmare scenario in which the Kurds will again face persecution and attack. How long can the international community allow the continued suffering of the Kurdish people?</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy must apply to all in any new Iraqi administration: to the Kurds, the Shias and the Turkmens and, of course, to the Iraqis themselves. But it must be achieved through peaceful means, not through the bombing and killing of half a million defenceless men, women and children.</p>

We have already mentioned a great many of them, but what strikes me at this stage is the incredible power of propaganda, and in particular of the process of demonisation. Throughout the world today there are many men and women who believe, probably entirely sincerely, that Saddam Hussein is threatening the peace of the world, or even, as Mr Poettering said just now – and if the situation were not so dramatic it would be amusing – that Saddam Hussein is starving his people, whereas the truth is exactly the opposite and is so simple that one is almost ashamed to have to spell it out: it is the American and British Governments which for years have imposed a terrible embargo on people who are reduced to living, or rather surviving, in a ghetto.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Iraq is a country which has been drained of blood and which is now quite incapable of fighting any sort of war. Karl Ritter, who headed the inspection mission that ended in 1998, assured us that it was impossible that Iraq could be in a position to build any weapon of mass destruction whatsoever. I repeat, the propaganda must have been very powerful to make us keep on swallowing one impossible lie after another.</p>
<p class="contents">Then again, even if Iraq were armed, what right would we have to deprive it of all means of defending itself? This is the second thing that propaganda has achieved, namely to make us lose sight of one of the conditions for world order, that is a world of sovereign nations who cooperate with one another and are well-balanced. No, the arming of Iraq is no more dangerous than that of other nations, and in particular that of its neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria, who are not necessarily motivated by the best of intentions. I believe, quite simply, that we do not have the right to disarm Iraq any more than we have the right to disarm any other country, as General de Gaulle reminded us in 1963 when he refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing that propaganda has achieved is to make us believe that what it calls the international community has the right to topple a regime, which is absolutely contrary to international law and even – and this is my final remark, Mr President – contrary to the most fundamental truth in the world, which is the liberty of nations. I hope that over the course of this century we shall gradually become aware of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have tried to explain this to Parliament, in over thirty speeches in public session, but we have tried in vain. Yet it is not too late to stop the infernal machine which, having caused the collapse of the CFSP and created discord within the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, is now threatening the peace of the world. War, the scourge of humanity, was outlawed by civilised nations and the League of Nations and then the United Nations Organization made it their principal objective to re-establish and protect peace. Only legitimate defence can justify having recourse to arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Who can really believe that Iraq, a small country which has been bled dry and ruined, could threaten the United States and Great Britain, which are a hundred times or a thousand times more powerful? Iraq has been summoned to prove its innocence, but we know that that is a diabolical demand, because in law it is for the accuser to prove guilt. Contemptible, discreditable processes have been used to justify this aggression. Mr Blair dared to present as evidence to the House of Commons a document stolen from a student and dating from ten years ago. Colin Powell, too, authenticated it before the Security Council. Even when their deception was discovered, neither of them drew the obvious conclusion, namely resignation. If, despite the opposition of their people, this premeditated crime is committed, then let the war criminals be condemned, and let the blood of the children of Iraq be on their hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If anyone is a mass murderer, it is Saddam Hussein; of that there is no doubt. The question is by what means he may be disarmed. We have to make clear the necessity of using every possibility of a peaceful solution, no matter how difficult that may be in the days that remain to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the Greek Presidency of the Council for having, despite the behaviour of many Member States of the European Union over recent weeks and months, summoned a special summit, in order that, in what one almost has to call a free-for-all in the European Union, we may seize the opportunity to pause for a moment and consider where there might be common ground, where we can still join in playing our part, in order to make a positive contribution. I hope that they will be supported by many Members of this House and that Monday's summit will meet with the success it deserves, so that Europe does not end up looking foolish on the sidelines of this dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to see that there must be no emotional reflex actions. Although historical parallels are never a good idea, I sometimes get the feeling that we are in something like the summer of 1914, and so I believe that we all have to engage in renewed dialogue with each other, so that we Europeans, being united on the essentials, can take our place in the negotiations on the final United Nations resolution, which must aim to make good use of every opportunity for peace, whilst at the same time making it clear that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed. If the relevant United Nations resolution makes it possible for this to be done by force if need be – but only if we avoid unilateralism – then we have a chance of doing this. But the use of force can be avoided only if Europeans present a united front. All those who have violated this unity have also thrown away Europe's chance of playing a part in this dispute.</p>

Its governments are, but its public opinion is not.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the majority of European public opinion is united against war. So the discussion on the division of Europe, in relation to the CFSP, must take this aspect into account. And, incidentally, the European citizens should take this into account when casting their votes in the forthcoming elections.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is an aspect which worries me particularly and that is the high number of governments of European candidate countries who have joined an operation which, rather than reinforcing European values and principles, supports the warlike approach of a non-European superpower whose values, such as the death penalty and the rejection of the International Criminal Court, are not our values. Having said that, I also have faith in the public opinion of those candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less optimistic when it comes to the gulf separating us from the United States, or rather the gulf which the Bush Administration is widening every day. I believe it is a bad sign that some sections of the so-called ‘liberal’ press in the United States are tending to jump on the war bandwagon and that in doing so it is furthermore using insults which are not supposedly worthy of it. Thus, regrettably, we have recently read this sentence in the New York Times: 'Only an imbecile or perhaps a Frenchman could be insensitive to Colin Powell’s arguments'. Well, I would declare myself French and insensitive.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This francophobia is being cultivated alongside germanophobia. It has just been said insultingly of the other unfortunate partner from the old Europe: 'The Germans do not play any important role in international decision-making', said by Richard Perle, one of Minister for War Rumsfeld’s tough advisers. Well, in view of this I would declare myself to be German and a Social Democrat.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, though, the greatest and most significant blunder is from Richard Boucher, spokesman for the State Department. As you know, Bin Laden has just said in a very timely manner that, in the face of the aggression being prepared, all Muslims should support the Iraqis, despite the fact that the latter are socialists and apostates. Rather than coming to the opposite conclusion, Mr Boucher not only states that this proves the links between Al Qaeda and Iraq, but he also adds: 'We have already said that this is a fight by civilisation to protect the civilised countries'.</p>
<p class="contents">So it now turns out, Mr President, dear friends, that the Bush Administration sponsors war between civilisations.</p>

The dull and brooding presence of sudden, unanticipated and violent death hangs over military and civilians alike in all our nations. Links have been found recently between the Al Qaeda network and pro-Saddam forces fighting the free Kurdish people in northern Iraq. However, a much better established and older terrorist organisation has been working inside Iraq since 1986: the MKO, or MEK as they are known inside the USA. The MKO have thousands of members inside Iraq and thousands outside, financed, equipped, armed and trained by the Iraqi army and fully engaged, militarily at least, since 1986 in all of Saddam's many wars.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA froze MEK assets in 1994, declaring the group under its many aliases to be an international terrorist organisation. The EU followed the US example as late as 2001, yet last week the New York Times published a full-page advertisement for the MEK, using the names and photographs of members of the US Congress and claiming their support. Our recent debates on Iraq have been attended by known members of MKO. These people are a threat to world security. Their organisation strikes silently but with lethal impact. This is Saddam's private international terrorist army, working against us all. Whatever our differences on the future treatment of Iraq, for the sake of our citizens and global safety, I urge that far greater security attention be paid to the MKO. For war or no war, with or without a war, the criminals who make up the MKO continually kill and destroy the innocent among us.</p>

That was humiliating, but was it inevitable? It is not clear. I know that it will be extremely difficult to reach agreement at next Monday’s summit of European leaders, but I refuse to accept that this is inevitable. There are the French proposals to increase the number and power of the inspectors. Next Friday, there will probably be a cautiously positive report from Dr Hans Blix and Mohamed El Baradei in favour of doing just that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore make an urgent plea to the governments of Great Britain, Spain and Italy to stop playing the role of yes men to the United States and to at last seize the very real chances we still have to disarm Iraq by peaceful means. I urge those same governments not to turn their backs on Europe. Many Members have said this already this afternoon: all the opinion polls in all the European countries point to one thing: it is not the French government, not the German government and not the Belgian government that have become isolated; instead it is Tony Blair, José María Aznar and Silvio Berlusconi that have lost touch with European reality. To the Eurosceptics in this Parliament, and also to the United States, who are quite happy about this discord among the EU Member States and see it as proof that it is unlikely that anything will ever come of one joint European policy, I would say this: this Parliament is a European institution that, in its pronouncement in its last resolution, gave a voice to the vast majority of the European population and that voice says ‘no war’. I sincerely hope, therefore, that, next Monday, that voice of the vast majority of the European population resounds in the heads and hearts of the European Heads of Government, too.</p>

Some say that this is exclusively Saddam Hussein’s responsibility. They are placing the fate of the world in the hands of a psychopathic dictator. We too have a responsibility, namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war. When we were in Baghdad last week, the weapons inspectors made it quite clear that, if they were to continue to be present, Saddam Hussein could neither develop new weapons nor use those he already has. We must give the weapons inspectors more time. We must support the Franco-German proposal, and we must do so partly on humanitarian grounds. UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that 100 000 Iraqis would die in the first 48 hours of a war. Seven million people would be without food, and 22 million debilitated Iraqis would be without clean drinking water. There would be a danger of civil war. Dare we take responsibility for all this by demanding that UN resolutions be complied with to the letter here and now? I also think that this debate is too serious to be subordinated to domestic policy.</p>

The three parties confirm that the disarmament of Iraq, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, is the common objective of the international community and it should be completed as soon as possible. This sentence contains four affirmations: yes Saddam Hussein is armed, yes he is (presumably) dangerous, yes he must be disarmed and yes this should be done as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">If this disarmament is to be effective, we must not let ourselves become bogged down in the wait-and-see policy and the beating about the bush that we have seen in the last ten years. If we are to avoid becoming bogged down, however, there is only one new argument, and that is the threat of armed intervention. It is absolutely essential that this argument should remain credible. We must do nothing to destroy its credibility if we want the discussions to make the progress that we are hoping for. This is why I believe deeply, Mr President, that the apparently different strategies of the countries of Europe and the United States are complementary rather than contradictory. We would do better to harness this complementary aspect if we are to avoid playing Saddam Hussein’s game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that the Greek Presidency will be holding very intense contacts in order to propose a common position, because intentions are not sufficient. But it did not take this crisis to demonstrate that one of the gaps that reform of the Treaties must confront is the lack of instruments to promote the common foreign and security policy. In fact, it is now exactly two years and seven months, Mr Nielson, since the Commission committed itself to adopting an initiative to respond to Parliament’s proposals on common European diplomacy. We are still waiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Member States have taken positions. I believe that the Franco-German axis is very positive in terms of promoting European integration, but with 15 Members, and particularly with 25, nobody, by definition, can assume they speak for the European Union, and neither do I believe – as some do – that the European identity must by definition be in opposition to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point the European institutions should take concrete initiatives – and I have not seen any – within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations, because the danger does not come from Islam but from the Iraqi regime, and also, despite all the difficulties, initiatives to re-launch the battered Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">And since there has been reference to European history, that history shows that complacency, the failure to meet responsibilities in relation to despotic dictators, for whom expansionist ambitions are intrinsic, may be more comfortable in the short term and also more popular – there were no opinion polls in 1938 but now there are – but sooner or later they cost us dearly in terms of freedom and human lives.</p>

The Bush Doctrine is founded on the assumption of the unilateral use of military might, underpinned by a commitment to preventive warfare. We in Europe must affirm our commitment to a multilateral approach, in other words, to the United Nations. We in Europe must start by using every means other than military force. We in Europe reject the theory of preventive strikes against potential dangers. We affirm our commitment to containing them, above all when this approach has a chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean in terms of Iraq? I believe it to mean that we all, out of profound conviction, abhor this regime in Iraq and its inhumanity. Everyone living in Iraq has the right to democratic government. Anyone who campaigns – as I do – for the rights of the Kurds in Turkey cannot fail to campaign for the rights of Kurds in Iraq. Yet no one country and no alliance – be it an alliance of the willing or of the unwilling and dependent – may claim for itself the right to simply get rid of disagreeable governments, and, moreover, to use massive force in doing so – not, above all, when a policy of containment has a chance of succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone living in the region and beyond it has a justified interest in weapons of mass destruction not ending up in the hands of Saddam Hussein. Is it not possible, though, to use inspections, surveillance flights, and other non-violent means to prevent him from getting his hands on dangerous weapons?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must surely not allow itself to be characterised by the pursuit of a policy of non-resistance and appeasement in the face of the present dangers. Is that, though, a reason for denying Europe the right to refuse to let fly with a war waged in the way that President Bush and Mr Rumsfeld want? We Europeans contend particularly for democracy and the rule of law in the Arab world, but we do not do it with weapons in our hands. Even ‘old Europe’ seeks a secure source of oil and gas, but do we therefore have the right to wage war for the sake of oil? We do not! If, moreover, doubt is cast on our clear and unequivocal commitment to the UN and to its resolutions, are we in this House not aware of how many UN resolutions have not been complied with? Are we not aware that there is a UN resolution, relating to this region, that dates back to 1947 and has still not yet been complied with? Even so, we are not willing to go to war, and rightly!</p>
<p class="contents">So I do believe that, yes, we are to help the United Nations get what it is entitled to. Yes, we are to strive for all the resolutions to be complied with, but that must mean all the resolutions – those on Palestine as much as those on Iraq. Then our position would be a truly European one.</p>

They expressly rejected any preventive war of aggression without United Nations approval. Any preventive strike against Iraq on the part of America and Great Britain would, without a doubt, be in breach of international law, and its consequences for the Middle East, for the Arab world, but also for the world community as a whole, would be incalculable. If one or more states arrogate to themselves the pre-eminent right to use force and take the law into their own hands, that amounts to unmitigated private warfare, the so-called law of the strong, one of the characteristics of which is that it breeds more private warfare. Looking at things from this angle, the European Union must do everything possible to avert a unilateral war of aggression.

The Council, the Commission and Parliament, acting together, can help to bring about a change in the situation in Baghdad. However, war can be avoided if Saddam Hussein leaves his country or if he can provide concrete evidence that he has destroyed all the prohibited weapons. Thus far, the dictator has failed to comply with the United Nations’ requests formulated in the 1991 resolution. If Iraq had behaved like South Africa, Belarus or Kazakhstan, we would not be in this tragic situation now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baghdad regime is guilty of a major violation of the will of the UN. Iraq has, in practice, failed to comply. I wonder, and I put it to you, whether it is still possible to prevent conflict. It may be, but Europe must stand united, the international community must stand united. Indeed, the Iraqi regime will use each division, each sign of weakening, to attempt to strengthen its own positions. That is why the Union must speak with a single voice in order to bring about peace, but also in order to ensure the safety of the citizens, who are still at the mercy of terrorist organisations which are threatening to use bacteriological and chemical weapons which may still be in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I support the position calling upon the institutions and governments of Europe to follow three guidelines. Firstly, to strengthen relations between the countries of the Union in order to achieve a common position. Secondly, to prevent divisions between the United States and the European Union, and, in this regard, I agree with the Italian politician who said that Europe cannot exist if it stands apart from or in opposition to the United States of America. Thirdly, to make every endeavour to preserve the credibility of the multilateral organisations, NATO and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, not forcing Saddam Hussein to respect the United Nations resolution is tantamount to divesting the Security Council of its authority. This is the line being taken by the Italian Government, which will be at the helm of the Union during the second half of the year. I feel this is another reason why we must pay careful attention to and support the peace-keeping initiatives emanating from Rome.</p>

He said that the poverty in Iraq at the moment is a result of the Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf war and ten years of international sanctions. I heard no mention whatsoever that Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction to kill hundreds of thousands of his own people. Nor was there any reference to the fact that Iraq has a corrupt dictatorship which represses freedom, stifles initiative and siphons off money that was intended for food and medicines for its own people under the oil-for-food programme, but is instead used by Saddam to build more of his own palaces. We must be clear that the villain of this piece is Saddam Hussein – full stop! Any weakening of that position will make war more, not less, likely.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Nielson also said that this is not an institutional problem, but then he gave us an institutional solution. He said that we could solve all these problems by more QMV. QMV will not create the political will to have common policies. We should have a common foreign and security policy – not a single policy but a <span class="italic">common</span> policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have our views on how it is that the common policy set in Copenhagen has suddenly somewhat disintegrated. The French President is very good at the rhetoric of European cooperation, but not so good at the practical aspects and seems to think common policies apply to everyone but <span class="italic">him</span>. Nonetheless, we must have a common policy. That much is very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves that Resolution 1441 states that Iraq is <span class="italic">already</span> in breach of UN resolutions and has been for over ten years and that any obstruction will lead to serious consequences. We have to be united in accepting that those serious consequences will follow. Any weakening of that position runs the risk of undermining world global security. If we are to resolve this situation we need less name-calling and a more coherent approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In March 1991, UN Resolution 686 set out the conditions of the cease-fire. In April 1991 UN Resolution 687 required Iraq to accept the internationally supervised destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and biological weapons, agents and components. In August 1991, UN Resolution 707 condemned Iraq's non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, after 12 years of flouted UN resolutions, 12 years of internal oppression and torture, 12 years of violence against the Kurds and Shi'ites of his own country, Saddam Hussein has been given a last chance. And yet, unlike when we took action to rescue the Falklands, Kuwait and Bosnia, this time our constituents are uneasy and uncertain. They see no unity of purpose among the governments of Europe. They see Member States declining to comply with their Nato obligation to protect Turkey against the possibility of attack. Their fears are confirmed that a European defence policy could be dangerous for Nato. They do not know why action is being proposed, what is supposed to happen at the end of it and which countries might be next.</p>
<p class="contents">The guilt of Saddam Hussein is in effect being compounded by the failure of our leaders to explain. My own Prime Minister, Mr Blair, has abysmally failed to persuade the British people. He could not even persuade a single one of his own Labour MEPs to vote for his policy. Unlike Iraq, we are democracies. Unlike Saddam, Mr Blair, you cannot go to war without heeding the concerns of your own people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we set out the facts and destroyed the myths. UN inspectors are not like a team of archaeologists excavating for ancient Mesopotamia in the sand. It is not their task to play 'seek' to Saddam's 'hide'. They are there to assess Saddam's evidence of how, when and where he has destroyed or handed over his weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need more inspectors. Mr Blix has confirmed that. We need compliance by Saddam Hussein. Where are those precursor chemicals, the munitions? Where are the tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents: 1.5 tonnes of VX nerve agent, 10 milligrams of which on the skin results in rapid death?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that any of us want war. We want peace, but we want a peace that is free from the threat of terrorism. Saddam Hussein needs to understand that either he complies in full with the UN resolutions or he risks plunging his own people, once again, into the suffering of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want to understate the disagreements that we are seeing on the international scene, or the need to reach a rapid agreement, in Europe first and then in the United Nations, on the assessment of the risks which are actually facing us and of the diplomatic, political and military means by which we can protect ourselves against them. It seems to me that most of the comments in the media are designed to appeal to the emotions rather than to provide an objective analysis of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community as a whole unanimously condemns the current Iraqi regime, its contempt for the most basic human rights, even those of its own people, and its consistent failure to comply with United Nations resolutions, even when it is not busy invading sovereign states. It is against this background that the members of the United Nations, and primarily those of the Security Council, must work steadily towards a consensus on the best way of settling the Iraqi question.</p>
<p class="contents">In a civilised and democratic world, the world to which we are appealing and the world which the current Iraqi regime is denigrating and making a mockery of, the proper response to a situation of this kind could certainly be a military one, but only after all other possible solutions have been exhausted. Before that, all reasonable solutions should be explored and attempted, or at least that is the idea which we, the representatives of free and democratic countries, have the honour and the duty to recommend and to put into practice. It seems to me to be pointless to compare the current situation with the situation in Europe in the thirties, to caricature the position of the United States, which is quite rightly coloured by the events of 11 September, or to focus attention on the differences of opinion between Europeans, who are split between intensified diplomatic action before any assault and immediate military intervention without any additional delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of peace or of war, of the life or the death of many human beings. That is what is at stake here, and it leaves little room for taking up positions which are demagogic, precipitate or tactical. Let us all, together, show our sang-froid and our capacity for reflection, and we shall overcome our differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important question, of course, is: is war inevitable? Anyone who has observed Saddam Hussein at all over the past 15 years cannot escape the conclusion that what we are dealing with here is one of the most dangerous heads of government in the world. This is a man who, out of self-interest, has attacked a peaceful neighbouring country. This is a man who has used poison gas on rebel Kurdish villages, thereby killing thousands of men, women and children. This is a man who permanently terrorises the south of his country, with its Shi-ite population. This is a man who, in spite of the poverty of his country, Commissioner Nielson, has built up an enormous and very costly arsenal of not only conventional, but also chemical and biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons, with which to permanently threaten and blackmail other countries, and to endanger world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who reads today’s article in <span class="italic">The</span> <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span> by Khidhir Hamza, a former head of Iraq’s nuclear programme, need have no doubt about the presence of those weapons and about what Saddam Hussein intends to do with them. This is a man who has amassed enormous wealth at the expense of his people and is also still proud of having personally carried out executions. To my mind, it is naive to go looking for weapons in that large country with 200 inspectors. Do you know that, in recent years, 6 000 inspectors have gone looking for weapons? Is it not very easy, given that the country has so many inaccessible mountainous regions, to hide weapons of this kind in caves?</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of a second Security Council resolution provided that the solution to the problem is not delayed further. But the position of France, Germany and Belgium in this as dissidents in the European camp is terribly worrying. Why have you not made the greatest efforts to agree on a single line? Sit yourselves down together, as the Ministers for Agriculture did earlier, until the white smoke comes out. I think that it is an excellent idea to actually get together on Monday; I sincerely hope that the European leaders can then iron out their differences and that they do not embarrass the European population and us again.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have so much need to find fault with the United States: we should be clear about who the real instigator is of all the trouble, that is, Saddam Hussein, and not George Bush. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It wants a peaceful solution to the conflict in Iraq. I assume that our Heads of Government also have that in view, all of them. The question to which the European population would like to hear an answer from its leaders goes without saying. It is the question as to whether all means have been employed to avert war in Iraq, and/or the scope for diplomacy has been completely exhausted, before a decision is taken to proceed with military action.</p>
<p class="contents">These days, there is a lot of criticism of the United States to be heard, and criticism is not a crime, of course, provided that, as our group leader just said, one does not confuse cause and effect. But criticism of the United States will not suffice these days in Europe: we must also have the courage to do some soul-searching ourselves. We are then faced with the question as to whether Europe has done its best for diplomacy in that 5 out of 15 or 8 out of 25 countries have taken up their own position, away from the others. We must also ask ourselves whether our diplomatic power of persuasion has been strengthened when three countries take decisions that do not even anticipate a decision to go to war, but which do put solidarity within NATO out of kilter. They are all serious questions. If crises are opportunities, and let us hope that they are, I think that we should perhaps calmly wait to hear what the weapons inspectors have to tell us on Friday in the Security Council, and I think that we should be happy that on Monday we have a European summit. We should encourage them not only to deliberate but also to reach clear, unanimous conclusions. We should encourage the Security Council to take decisions that do what has to be done in Iraq, but in such a way that the cure is not worse than the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, we must not lose hope, and we must keep pushing, in the Convention, for decision-making mechanisms which make an effective foreign and security policy possible and which also give us a military footing, such that we acquire power and become a worthy and valuable partner of the United States within NATO and the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Portuguese Members of the European People’s Party unreservedly support this view because this is a clear position underpinned by the political tradition of the European democracies, based on the transatlantic alliance with the democracy represented by the US and also, it should be remembered, by Canada, Australia and many other democratic countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It comes as no surprise that today this approach has the support of the overwhelming majority of European countries, within the European Union, amongst those who will be joining it in the forthcoming round of enlargement, and also amongst other countries on the continent. Nevertheless, recent events that have led to a crisis in NATO and to the danger of a veto in the Security Council by Member States of the Union pose a serious risk to the unity of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing is that there can be no common foreign policy based on anti-American prejudice and on complacency towards the threat from dictators who present a danger to world peace, such as Saddam Hussein. We should, therefore, bear in mind some aspects that should not be forgotten:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, Europe does not have strategic defence capacity against the new forms of international terrorism that are bound up with the States that support them;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, the only strategic defence body of which Europeans countries are members is NATO. If this body goes into crisis, it is Europe that will suffer most at the hands of its enemies, more than the United States, for example, because Europe cannot defend itself. The crisis in NATO will make any common defence policy for the European Union impossible;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, for the enlargement countries, with their recent experience of totalitarian regimes, security concerns are vital. Provoking a crisis in NATO will be profoundly damaging to these countries and will cause them to have confidence only in bilateral strategic alliances with the United States, outside the framework of the European Union and of NATO. It would be extremely bad if these countries’ freedom to take political decisions suffered because they do not agree with some, and I repeat some, countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the effect of a crisis in NATO will isolate the Europeans, and will reinforce the United States’ tendency to act unilaterally. If the United States and its allies, including the majority of European countries, were to embark on military action in order to ensure compliance with Resolution 1441 without the explicit support of the European Union and with NATO in deadlock, the damage caused to European alliances will be very difficult to resolve. This is my request to the Council and the Commission; please use the little time available to you to prevent action being taken to force Iraq to comply with the Resolution without there being unity amongst the countries of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They prefer to disarm Iraq by peaceful means, using the weapons inspectors. More pressure must be put on Iraq to cooperate. Parliament has contributed to this through its resolution and by a number of MEPs travelling to Baghdad to explain our position. A majority in Parliament is on the same wavelength, therefore, as the majority of the public. It is remarkable that the governments of some Member States would rather take the side of the United States than that of their own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Even Turkey, traditionally a staunch supporter of the United States, considers war to be very risky. And then people say that France, Germany and Belgium are isolated! Would it not be the US, rather, that was isolated if they could not bring to bear a whole arsenal of means of coercion?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to make every effort to stave off a military invasion of Iraq. Peaceful means must indeed be used to bring Iraq not only to disarm, but also to change, to respect human rights, to respect the right to life and respect for the diverse peoples and cultures within the Iraqi borders and to respect for all the peoples in the region.</p>

With or without the authorisation of the Security Council, this war is unjustifiable. Of course we must hope that reason will prevail within the Security Council and that, if there is a war, it will be formally contrary to international legality.</p>
<p class="contents">Those thirty or so of us who have just been to Iraq were able to see for ourselves the state of material and moral dilapidation of the country, trapped as it is between a ludicrous and bloody dictatorship and the sanctions imposed by the international community. The Iraqi army is merely a shadow of its former self, and is formidable only in the hallucinations of the American President. What concerns the oil-obsessed Government of the United States is of course control of the black gold, and not the weapons of mass destruction which, as the experts know full well, Iraq does not possess.</p>
<p class="contents">This war will be another crushing blow for people who are already suffering greatly, particularly the Kurdish population. Among those people it will give rise to lasting and justified hatred of the West, and will cause innumerable tragedies. This crisis shows how far Europe still has to go before it becomes anything other than an integrated economic area.</p>
