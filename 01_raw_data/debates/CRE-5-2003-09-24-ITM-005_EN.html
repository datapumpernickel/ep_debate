<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing a catastrophic situation in the Middle East, and one of course wonders who is to be blamed for it. It would be far too simple to attribute responsibility to one side alone, but it must give us pause for thought when Abraham Burg, a member of the Israeli Knesset whom we welcomed to this House some time ago, tells us that the Israel of today has the choice between Jewish radicalism and democracy, settlements or hope for both peoples, the deceptive visions of barbed wire, street blockades and suicide attacks or an international border between two states and Jerusalem as their shared capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what Mr Burg is telling us calls us back to something present at the birth of Israel and of what could have become Palestine, and that is the decision of the United Nations. Some of those who spoke before me have made it clear that we have to get the United Nations more deeply involved, with a peacekeeping force to bring peace to this region. At present, that is not yet accepted, but I hope that the situation does not have to deteriorate still further and become even more extreme before we can accept the involvement of the United Nations and of peacekeeping troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add another observation on terrorism, this one from Avi Shlaim, writing in today’s <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span>: ‘The real obstacle to peace is Sharon, not Arafat.’ I think that is perhaps putting it in rather too simple terms, and provocative ones at that. I share the view expressed by the Presidency, that neither Sharon nor Arafat are angels of peace, and that what is needed instead is other people who are capable of making peace. I am very grateful, too, to Mr Zimeray for very recently bringing to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy people from Israel and Palestine who want to make peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two reasons for the profound conviction that leads me to abominate terrorism; not only does it kill innocent people along with the so-called enemy, but it also always bears within itself the seeds of self-destruction. It is not only Israel’s retaliation attacks that I have in mind; I also believe that a society built upon terrorism possesses an inherent capacity for self-destruction. Whilst I understand why the Presidency is taking the initiative in having certain organisations blacklisted, the one thing I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us is what we are to do about this shameful wall that runs through Israel. On what list are we going to put that? The fact is that there is violence other than terrorism in the traditional sense. Perhaps we ought to maintain a list of actions that are detrimental to peace but do not constitute terrorism. This wall – God knows – should be on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that his successor will have more resources in order to take action there.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the war in Iraq has contributed to worsening the situation in Palestine. A decision such as the war in Iraq, a unilateral one, has led to a worsening of the situation and an increase in acts of terror. I believe, therefore, that the European Union must strengthen acts of multilateralism such as the Quartet and the establishment of the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demand from the leaders, both Israeli and Palestinian, the political commitment to seek peace. Selective assassinations must come to an end and terrorist attacks must also come to an end; we must remember that not only terrorists are implicated in an attack, but also those who provide them with resources and those who perhaps turn a blind eye to the preparation of those attacks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken. The two protagonists and their international supporters can argue interminably, and sometimes even convincingly, to justify their sides' violence. But this is a sterile debate and I do not propose to get into it.</p>
<p class="contents">The two sides have to be kept apart, but the normal constraints of morality, self-discipline and the rule of law have been drowned in a seething reservoir of hatred and revenge. As things now stand, neither side will stand back for long enough to allow these intense emotions to abate. They fear and distrust each other too much. It is clear that an international force must be interposed between them, because there is literally no other way of keeping them apart. This force must command the confidence of the two sides. To achieve this it has to include United States and EU components. The American presence will reassure the Israelis, who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally. The Palestinians see the EU as an honest and trustworthy broker. A realistic appeal can then be made to both sides for restraint while the force is being organised and deployed. Simultaneously, the peace process can be reactivated on the basis of the so-called roadmap, which has been accepted by the two sides. It can work, if it gets time. It will get time if there is no violence, and I believe the international force could break the cycle of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can now vindicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy. There is nothing else in sight. It <span class="italic">is</span> exceedingly urgent. The prize is much more than peace in the Middle East: it is world peace, because continued violence in the Middle East is a poisonous backcloth to a lot of the terrorism which continues to happen in all parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One day the history of this missed opportunity, this wasted time will be written about, and those who thought that violence was a justifiable political weapon will be judged very harshly.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, we experienced an exceptionally powerful moment in Parliament, a moment of genuine enlightenment, when we received the Palestinian, Mr Nusseibeh and the Israeli, Mr Yalon. They represent hope, because hope emanates from the communities themselves. Europe could be built because in 1946 a Franco-German commission decided to withdraw anti-German phrases from French schoolbooks and anti-French phrases from German schoolbooks. From that time on, we have not called the Germans ‘Boches’; we have given them different names and looked at them through different eyes. This is the message that we must send to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people in both communities who think in terms of dialogue, reconciliation, the future and development. These are the people who warrant our support. Those who truly deserve to win the Nobel prize are the Palestinian intellectuals who take the risk, as Camus once did, of condemning terrorism as an absolute evil and a crime against humanity. I cannot allow it to be said, as it was a few minutes ago, that the actions of Hamas have anything in common with the French resistance movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The real heroes are also the ordinary Israelis, the bus drivers that no human shield has ever thought about accompanying. Europe must think about the communities and about the future. We must stop acting as prosecutors, since we are not really qualified to sit in judgment. We must play the role of a realistic and courageous guide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way forward is for both sides to get together around a table. What could they bring that might break the deadlock? Perhaps Palestine could re-examine the status of her intifada. It is an armed intifada. She should ask herself whether an intifada has to be armed to qualify as a genuine intifada. The answer to that is 'no'. Most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas. Perhaps she could withdraw from violence by making her intifada a peaceful one.</p>
<p class="contents">What about Israel? Israel has a responsibility to bring Palestine to independent statehood. Palestine cannot be an independent state if it is not financially viable. Israel could think hard and re-examine her approach towards helping Palestine to trade freely, without adding on costs and without using the wall to further depress agricultural or factory production.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much to be done if both sides can get together. Looking at just those two simple items, success could still be within their grasp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I see this, though, as giving rise to three specific demands. First of all, in the first phase of the roadmap, there is reference to the need to destroy the infrastructure of terror. What contribution are we making to that? What contribution can we make to it? This is where there is a need for further initiatives, especially together with the United Nations, if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am very grateful to the European Union for now having blacklisted the civilian wings of certain movements. I would ask, though, that we now do what the Palestinian Authority has already done, and block their accounts, so that there is no possibility of terrorism being funded through European bank accounts. In this, we should not merely make declarations, but take the appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is something that has been for many years a major concern for me as a member of the Committee on Budgets, namely the issue of the form of the Palestinian Authority. It is a fact that we in the European Union have been spending a very great deal of money, and I would like to see it achieving something. We cannot be expected to invest in a system that does not correspond to what our Budget regulations require. Instead, we must ensure the creation of stable structures capable of giving a country like this peaceful civilian administration in the long term.</p>

<p class="contents">We may not always have appreciated the role played by Yasser Arafat, just as we have hardly ever appreciated the role played by Sharon, but we should not forget that President Arafat was democratically elected as president of a people deprived of a homeland, of its own territory and a peaceful existence. If we forget that we are guilty of conceit, evasiveness and superficiality.</p>
<p class="contents">If we condemn terrorism against Israel firmly and with absolute sincerity – and we condemn it with all our strength and with all due vehemence – then we should condemn with equal force and vehemence the character assassination by the media of the democratically elected president of a people. We call on the Presidency not just to denounce his exile as unacceptable. We should also be denouncing the indecent incitement to homicide by a minister in the Israeli Government and by an influential newspaper like the <span class="italic">Jerusalem Post</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">What can Europe do? Just blacklist <span class="italic">Hamas</span>? I do not think that is enough. We need to be firm on three points: we should call for an end to the blockade on the Palestinian territories; we must call for an end to all settlement activities; and we must call for the demolition of the security wall, which amounts, in practice, to an annexation of territory and is a violation of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must invest here, and one possibility might be to send in a ground force that would make a decisive, practical contribution to monitoring respect for reciprocal obligations. The only alternative to peace is peace, but to make this possible Europe must take practical action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was too much, however! It was too much for Arafat, who precipitated the crisis in his security services and who forced Abu Mazen to resign. President Arafat’s beatification by the international institutions does not alter the appalling fact that we are still waiting to hear a renunciation of terrorism. Today, it is Arafat who is responsible for the Palestinian suffering, having sabotaged several attempts to secure peace. He is the Saddam Hussein of the Palestinian people and I hope that they will be able to rid themselves of him! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Serious mistakes have been made. Clearly the Palestinian Authority was unable or unwilling to rein in the excesses of Islamic and other terrorist groups, as we saw in the Hamas suicide bomb a month ago in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I welcome the EU's belated banning of the political wing of Hamas from fund-raising in its territory. I also believe that the undermining by Chairman Arafat of Prime Minister Abu Mazen has further muddied the waters, and lends credibility to those who argue that Arafat has no interest in going the last mile for peace and security if he is not at centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, coded calls for his assassination recently by Israel's Deputy Prime Minister are not helpful, as he was recognised as the elected PA Chairman, and this lowers the moral tone of the debate. Our challenge is to encourage reformists and moderate interlocutors amongst the Palestinians. I met a Professor Nusseibeh two weeks ago in Brussels and he is clearly an example of the type of Palestinian who is acting in good faith and is prepared to make compromises, including over the vexed issue of the right of return and the final status of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">Both issues can be solved with imaginative thinking and money. The international community needs to redouble its efforts to reconvene the roadmap to enable a two-state solution with a viable, contiguous state of Palestine, based approximately on the 1967 borders, and a secure Israel living in peaceful, neighbourly coexistence. Otherwise, Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world will use this conflict to galvanise the Islamic world against the West, using it as a pretext to justify worldwide terrorist attacks. Unlike my colleague, Mr Cushnahan, I am not yet convinced that an international military force is the solution needed to end the hostilities and kick-start the peace process, as I do not think that a totally neutral force could ever be assembled.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I have been involved in Parliament's working group looking at EU funding to the Palestinian Authority, which is proceeding on schedule. It has been a worthwhile exercise in addressing so many of our taxpayers' concerns about serious allegations of misappropriation of funds, and now we have in place the appropriate mechanisms for scrutiny of the way these monies are being spent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A solution should be sought not by military means, but by way of politics and -diplomacy, but one of the key problems is that the leaders on both sides – and I mean on both sides – are in a weak position. Despite this, there still seems to be goodwill, as is evident, among other things, from the proposal to release a number prisoners from each side.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should play a pioneering role, much more so than it has done to date. We are, after all, the region’s key trading partner. I would therefore argue in favour of working for peace from this House, this Parliament, even though it appears that Parliament is becoming increasingly divided into two camps. It is not up to us in the European Parliament to fan the flames through all kinds of unilateral actions. On the contrary, we must use our joint goodwill and energy much more to help establish reconciliation and lasting peace. That is the Parliament’s task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very easy to say to other people, to the Israelis and the Palestinians, what they must do, but perhaps we should consider what Europe is doing, what we are doing, because we can do something about that, because it is in our hands. In this regard, I did not like the comments of the Council, which has taken the bait, which has become embroiled in the current media war.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot depend on the media war, on statements and threats. We must work on what Europe is doing. In this regard, European policy has been rather ambiguous in recent months, because, if Europe played an important role in creating the figure of Abu Mazen, what has it done to support him? I would like to put this question to the Council, and also, and above all, to the Commission. What have we done to ensure that the Palestinians do their duties, such as to support Abu Mazen so that he may have a single police force or to demand that Arafat concede some of his powers to a minister who he himself had supported? What have we done in order to build a country able to accept its responsibilities as an independent and democratic state? What have we done to exchange our very nice NGO programmes, peace declarations, human rights groups, doves in schools, for a system and health services which are not managed by the Church or by a terrorist system like <span class="italic">Hamas</span>, which is paying doctors and teachers? There are more than 1 200 000 children lacking a proper education system.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we should be asking is: what has Europe done to strengthen the system of security and justice?</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn the wall, because it runs counter to any democratic system and is a physical and moral aggression, but we must also build the country and support the victims of terrorism. Europe must open a line of support for these victims. It must take a position and combat the prevailing ambiguity.</p>

The recent series of threats by the Israeli Government to expel Yasser Arafat, which culminated in the Deputy Prime Minister’s suggestion that he be assassinated, is totally unacceptable and despicable. The United Nations General Assembly has criticised the Israeli Government in this connection. The United States veto of a UN Security Council resolution to this effect (a vote from which, moreover, Germany and the United Kingdom abstained) is deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot simply, in the words of the statement by the Presidency of the European Union, express ‘its deep preoccupation’, ask ‘the Israeli Government to refrain from any use of force and, in particular, from the expulsion of President Arafat’, or consider the Israeli Government and the Palestinian people as equals. To do so is to ape the stance of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to put significant pressure on the Israeli authorities with a view to ending the military occupation, the killings, the annexing of Palestinian territory, the building of the wall to control the movements of Palestinians, and, in general, the campaign of pure state terrorism being conducted against the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.
