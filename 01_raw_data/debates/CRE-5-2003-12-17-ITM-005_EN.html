<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Let me start by warmly thanking my fellow-Members of this House for their very constructive cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, to whom many thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that the Commission put before us was indeed a very ambitious one, with much promised by a forward-looking new technology based on satellite navigation and mobile communications. By 2012 at the latest, according to the proposal, the Member States were to be required to use this technology for the charging of tolls, which would have meant the abolition of all the other technical systems currently in existence, which are based on short-range microwave technology. This was meant to achieve technical interoperability, which was the actual object of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the right one. In a common internal market, it is not acceptable for technical barriers to put the brakes on the flow of traffic and hence on the transport of goods. Incompatibility between national toll systems could have no other result; it creates problems for international road traffic and interferes with the smooth functioning of the internal market. The legislative proposal also aims at contractual interoperability; one contract for each user, and valid throughout Europe, would certainly be a good thing. I might mention that this is also an ambitious goal in view of the continuing need for a great deal of harmonisation within the EU, whether in the fiscal, administrative or legal spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">I was unable, however, as this House’s rapporteur, to go along with the Commission proposal as it relates to technical interoperability. Why is this so? The problem we face is that the new toll technology that the Commission favours, and which is currently being developed only in Germany, does not yet work. Technology that does not work does not exist in real terms, so can legislators prescribe as mandatory something that does not exist? Is it, in any case, any legislator’s task to prescribe one technology or another? No, I do not believe that it is. As the majority of my fellow-Members share my view that it is for the market to decide what specific technologies should be used, we have agreed not to follow the Commission on this point. We want to take a more technology-neutral approach. We take the view that the actual objective – the technical interoperability of the various systems – has to be achieved. We have been told by the users – the operating companies in the various Member States in which electronic toll-charging systems are in use – that this can be done. By the present proposal, as now amended, we insist on this; technical interoperability must be achieved, and what this ultimately means is that the technology currently in use must be changed only as and when it cannot be enabled to communicate with other systems of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We also see it as important that subsidiarity should be safeguarded. The basic decision on whether or not to charge a toll, on what vehicles and what stretches or types of road, must remain a matter for the Member States. I also think it is important that I should take this opportunity to point out that data protection must be treated as a matter of the highest priority. We do not want drivers to end up having everything known about them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that, in all our debates, I repeatedly stressed my view that satellite technology is extraordinarily important. I am convinced that we are doing the right thing in developing Galileo, the European satellite system. In order to put this conviction on record, I have now, at first reading, tabled an amendment drafted in stronger terms. I would emphasise that it was my esteemed colleague Mrs Langenhagen who originally tabled this amendment in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, where it struck me as too rigorous to be able to command a majority. As regards tomorrow’s vote in the plenary, though, I am working on the assumption that this House will endorse this unequivocal vote in favour of Europe having its own satellite navigation system, one that will make us Europeans independent of others. This, again, I ask you to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by asking you to believe me when I say that for me, as a German rapporteur, it has not – heaven knows – been an easy matter to propose this course of action to you. The original draft from the Commission would eventually have given German industry an enormous opportunity; it could have marketed the new and innovative toll-charging technology the length and breadth of Europe. This new technology is fantastic. Not only – I am convinced – is it the only technical solution that can be regarded as suitable to German conditions, but it also has many other potential uses over and beyond simply collecting tolls. Let me reiterate, though, that a technology that does not exist in real terms cannot be made mandatory by law. It is a source of bitter anguish to me that the amateurish approach adopted by the German Federal Government, particularly when negotiating the contracts to introduce toll-charging technology, has resulted in such a debacle, one that leaves us, at European level, no solution other than the one I have now proposed to you.</p>

In Switzerland, 66% of freight is transported by rail and 30% by road; in the EU, the proportions are reversed and the difference even more starkly pronounced. What this means is that, politically speaking, the Swiss are doing something that we in Europe, in the European Union, cannot manage to do. They fix the heavy traffic levy at such a level that all external costs are completely internalised, so that the costs of road surfaces, accidents and environmental damage by noise and air pollution are all covered. Of this revenue, 80% is spent on the alternative; on building base tunnels, on measures for protection from railway noise and on improvements to rail services.</p>
<p class="contents">In technological matters, too, the Swiss, in little Switzerland, are years ahead of the EU. The Swiss have a system, one that works well, with microwave technology, to be combined in future with digital tachographs. The question is: why can we not manage that in the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for the Eurovignette again lays down a maximum, one that is so low that nobody can seriously believe that it offers any proper incentive to use rail rather than road; nor, indeed, are the Member States allowed to spend most of this money on the alternative. What this means is that this is a half-hearted policy, and we see its results when we consider the statistics on climate change, accidents and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In much the same way as the German transport ministry, the Commission has allowed itself to be pressed into the service of two big players and wants to force upon us satellite technology that is not yet fully developed. I think that we who sit on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as on the other, would be doing well to bring the Commission back a bit nearer to earthbound reality and to demand neutrality in matters of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I want to say something about the effect that distorted competition between road and rail has on society. After this House had adopted, after only one reading, Mr Markov’s directive on driving hours and rest periods, Mr Berlusconi and his government did not even think it necessary to put it on the Council’s agenda. That, I think, is quite simply a scandal. How can we in Europe make progress on the social and environmental fronts when such significant directives are not allowed to make progress at Council level? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Directive appears amongst the proposals in the White Paper on transport policy and, clearly, it is a preliminary step to establishing the new Eurovignette system and to facilitating the payment by users of the costs of the use of road infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive has the following three objectives: firstly, the interoperability of electronic road toll systems; secondly, the establishment of a European electronic road toll system; and, thirdly, the introduction of satellite technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of interoperability allows us to remove the obstacles standing in the way of creating the internal market in electronic tolls and therefore to prevent barriers; it allows us to extend electronic tolls more widely and restrict congestion at payment points.</p>
<p class="contents">The European electronic road toll service we are proposing, like the interoperability of systems, responds to genuine need for users, in particular lorry drivers, who want an electronic means of payment as soon as possible, a single one for the whole of the network. The service we are proposing, based on the principle of a single contract, offers both users and operators the protection of a clear legal document which can be used in the event of a dispute. It is a question of implementing in this field what already exists, for example, in the fields of mobile telephones and bank card systems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the migration of the current electronic toll systems, based on microwave systems, to satellite technology, I will say that this is the only solution for the future which allows us to respond to the various needs of the European Union’s charging policy and which will furthermore allow us to considerably improve the quality of road transport, thanks to the establishment of new telematic services and new possibilities, particularly security systems, such as speed restrictors, anti-collision devices, the monitoring of the traffic in dangerous goods, information for travellers – in accordance with their position – on the situation on the different roads and on the fluidity of traffic at different points etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the lack of a firm commitment in favour of satellite technology would not be coherent with the decisive policy being maintained by this Commission and this Parliament in particular, as well as the Council and the European Union as a whole, in favour of the Galileo system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that numerous Member States – with the notable exceptions of Germany and Italy – wish to continue using microwave systems in parallel with satellite systems. This desire, which is understandable in view of the investments already made, can be dealt with by integrating a firm recommendation on the solution for the satellites – rather than obtaining the full and closed commitment – which allows this to become a reality in the medium term. This is also accepted by the Council. I am going to listen to the rest of the debate, but I hope that, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, and the co-rapporteur, Mr Turmes, and thanks to the work of the Council, we can adopt it at first reading – which I would insist is extremely important – in order the facilitate the use of toll systems on roads in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today we were not going to talk about the ‘Eurovignette Directive’, but I would like to say to Mr Turmes that the working group on transport has already met on several occasions with a view to making progress on the debate on this complex Directive, and we are trying to achieve as successful a result as the one I expect with the ‘Electronic Toll Directive’, in other words that, at first reading – before the end, therefore, of Parliament's current mandate – Parliament and the Council can adopt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, her work is so good that I believe that there will be agreement with the Council right from the first reading, which makes today's debate less interesting. But, in all events, this does not mean that we should not recall that Mrs Sommer worked in a very good and systematic manner and managed to make the Commission's initial proposal acceptable to almost all the members of our committee. At the same time, she agreed with the Council that we would proceed very quickly on what was necessary, in other words the interoperability of toll systems at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission proposal in principle, because it makes life easier for users, that is, drivers, who will have fewer difficulties in cross-border transport with this approach. We simply have a few objections – and I am glad that both the Commission and the Council understand them – which focus on two points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, when will this new toll concept start to be applied? We propose that the timetable be postponed from 2005 to 2007 for buses and lorries, because we consider that two years are needed so that everyone who has to adapt can adapt and the system can start operating.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, will the new satellite positioning system be applied exclusively or not? This system caused a great many problems when it started to be applied in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it does the rapporteur credit that she demonstrates a truly European perception of this specific issue; in other words, she does not want to impose the German system exclusively and she proposes, with all her fellow Members, that this decision be taken in agreement with the relevant sector, the Member States and the other agencies involved, so that we really can be sure that the systems will be interoperable and efficient for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that in the final analysis this directive is very important, on the one hand because its purpose is to make life easier for all those road-transport operators who of course pass through toll stations and who often need to change the system or method of payment, but also because it is a directive which is very much open to the prospects of future technology, in particular as regards the implementation of the Galileo system.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the PSE Group believe that this directive was initially a little inflexible and very restricting for the motorway-transport sector. In effect, it required that sector to ensure, very rapidly, the interoperability of current microwave systems, in other words to invest very heavily, only to switch very quickly to another system two years later.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt it was unacceptable to demand such a double effort from the sector, and I welcome the fact that we were able to agree on Amendment No 48, by Mrs Sommer, which strongly recommends Galileo and advocates waiting for an intermediate report by the Commission in order to determine the conditions under which we shall implement the switch. Nevertheless, we are very keen on the satellite positioning system and we believe that that is where the future lies, not only for tolls, but for a multitude of other services.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that we have given preference to the interoperability of systems, in other words most of the amendments that we have tabled, whether it is Amendment No 11 submitted by us or Amendment No 46 submitted by Mrs Sommer, are essentially aimed, not necessarily at having a unified system, but at making systems interoperable, and we believe that in the short term that is what should be required. In other words, we also have to ensure that certain microwave systems can be interoperable with GPM/GPRS technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also reviewed the timetable. I think that the timetable proposed by the Commission was quite simply unrealistic, because it did not take into account the time needed for the legislative work and the fact that we were unable to require that the European electronic toll system be brought into line so rapidly, that is, by 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the PSE Group is concerned, we have proposed, at the request of the City of London – which does not seem to be particularly Socialist – which is following this debate closely, to restrict the scope slightly and to make provision for a transitional phase for local toll systems. London, in fact, has just implemented its own system. It is a very promising experiment and I do not think that we ought to restrict it too much.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, we are fiercely – that is no doubt too strong a word – opposed to the amendments tabled by our Italian fellow Members, namely Amendments Nos 19, 23, 26, 27 and 29, which aim to propose a system of contractual rules rather than a European electronic toll system. We believe that there must be a European electronic toll system. It is clearer from the legal point of view, and it is also more stable, simpler and easier to understand. We shall therefore oppose these Italian proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, we are entirely in agreement with Amendment No 39 which seeks to protect privacy, since we are proposing a switch to Galileo. It seems to us that these precautions are necessary. Finally, we shall approve and support Amendment No 40 tabled by the Verts/ALE Group, because we believe that a toll cannot amount to nothing more than a tax or an additional charge. Nor can a toll be simply a means of covering the depreciation of our road infrastructure. A toll must also be a transport-policy tool, and must be able to guarantee modal transfer and cross-financing, so as to encourage people to switch to other alternative modes of transport in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, we see how more and more EU countries are introducing road tolls, often backed by different technical systems. This is one of the main points I believe we should emphasise, namely that we must not focus exclusively upon one technical system, such as satellite navigation, but, on the contrary, permit different systems that are interoperable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is enough to look at the situation in Germany, which has come down unilaterally in favour of a particular system which is patently not operating as intended. That is not an example we should follow at EU level. In connection with the German system, there was also another problem, namely that there were not enough boxes available, with the result that hauliers in different countries did not have the opportunity to have these boxes installed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also something else we must avoid in the future. I think that, in order to be focused upon its users, the system must also ensure, at a purely technical level, that hauliers and their drivers only have to install a single box in each vehicle. This would ease the administrative burden for the transport companies, and it would also mean greater road safety, for drivers would only have to concentrate on one piece of equipment. It is also important that users be guaranteed access to a coherent network through a single contract relating to the overall network of roads involving tolls.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, these are all aspects it is very important to bear in mind in connection with the reading of this report. I therefore hope we obtain an agreement that puts users in the driving seat. I also hope you have noticed that I have left a little time for those who, unlike myself, have exceeded their speaking time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that the introduction of a Eurovignette is dependent on the interoperability of toll systems, which means that the technology must be available, and work, before we can start charging for the Eurovignette, and we all know how urgently we need the money. We know that there is a considerable shortfall of funds in the railway sector. We saw, indeed, in our most recent debates on the necessary size of the European Union’s budgets, that there is in this sector a need for both revenue and for costs to be apportioned realistically, in other words, that railways, which have to pay their way, must, as regards costs, be put on an equal footing with roads, and that HGVs and other freight traffic must also pay to use roads.</p>
<p class="contents">So we unreservedly back Mrs Sommer as regards the guidelines she has laid down and endorse her statement that we need a solution that is not dependent on technology. The aim is that the technology that is used should be capable of being used anywhere, and soon. That is what we are aiming for, and it is a very good thing that Parliament is sticking to this line. Thank you, Mrs Sommer: we need a practicable solution, and we are right behind you. The introduction of the actual instrument that we need – the Eurovignette, an instrument of policy that this admittedly highly technical report is seeking to bring about – is absolutely dependent on a practicable solution being found. Speaking, then, as a representative of a government that has shown how not to do it, I can say that the Greens – and I am absolutely of one mind with the German Greens on this – see practicability as the decisive factor in a solution. Let me warn you, Commissioner, against going all-out for big technology that does not always work, and neglecting the other practical aspects. I believe that Mrs Sommer’s report imposes the right conditions and shows it has to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, on the one hand, referring to the technical aspects that are being discussed and whereby it is intended to achieve interoperability of electronic toll collection systems across the Union. Nobody in their right mind will be opposed to this. It does, however, strike me that this report steers clear of a few important political issues that have arisen during the discussion of this topic, and so a more comprehensive discussion would have been desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly emphasise the fact that it should remain up to the Member States themselves to assess the desirability of a toll system for lorries and passenger cars. It seems rather logical to me that in a peripheral or insular state, such as Portugal, or Malta, which is due to accede in the near future, the economic and political considerations there are different from those in, for example, Flanders, which, being situated between Germany, France, the Netherlands and Great Britain, forms the EU’s central traffic intersection. The Flemish motorways are at risk of being oversaturated by the exponential increase in freight traffic. In order to stimulate transport by rail and sea, for example, Flanders should be able to use criteria that are different from those of other Member States, if it wanted to introduce toll collections for freight traffic tomorrow, because it collects no tolls at present. The same applies to toll collections on passenger transport, whereby so many different factors, including tourism, traffic density, air pollution, economic structures, and so on, can play a role in determining whether or not such toll collections are desirable. Every government should retain the right to weigh up for itself whether the already heavily taxed car drivers – and we are talking about working people who keep the wheels of industry oiled – should be taxed even more.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe may harmonise the technical aspects of – and I should like to drive this point home – <span class="italic">existing</span> toll systems. When it comes to making political and economic decisions in this respect, this Parliament and the Commission would do well to show a little more respect for the subsidiarity principle, to which often only lip service is paid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are for me a number of concerns which still remain and which still need further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my main concerns centred on the familiar subject of subsidarity, already mentioned by the previous speaker. In this particular case, I do not believe that the EU should be able to foist road pricing upon the UK, or any other EU country for that matter, and I am therefore pleased to see an amendment guaranteeing the subsidiarity principle in this report. Thus it is now clear that the proposal should not imply the mandatory EU-wide introduction of toll systems. Such a move would doubtless mean, for example, that the UK Government, which is currently considering road pricing, would simply have passed the buck for such an unpopular move on to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see that we are to let the markets dictate what technology, if any, should be used. The notion that a satellite technology system would be our sole system is to me quite ridiculous. Indeed, it is the proposal to use satellite technology which irks me most. I have argued several times in committee that civil liberties issues that accompany this particular type of technology are a grave threat to people's everyday lives. We all know that, improperly used, satellite tracking is just another form of Big Brother. There is also the not insubstantial cost to business and individuals, who presumably would have to pay for the installation of such technology.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more positive note, the committee's decision to put back the Commission's implementation dates was very much welcome. The original request was both highly illogical and unrealistic. But regrettably, unless the issues to which I have referred are fully addressed, in particular the reference to the use of satellite systems, I will be unable to support the rapporteur in her overall proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission proposal was – or is – bolder and more forward-looking, albeit somewhat more risky. Unfortunately, I have to add, the Commission’s staff have perhaps been insufficiently energetic or enthusiastic in pleading the technical merits of this proposal. We can certainly live with what Mrs Sommer has put together and the Committee have adopted, but I would like to point out that it would actually do the European’s image some good if it were to move towards the most modern technology, not just because the technology is the most up-to-date, but because it is highly flexible. Advocates of a toll system, at any rate, know how important tolls can be in regulating traffic flow and diverting traffic from overstretched or environmentally vulnerable areas to other routes. They know that a high degree of flexibility is needed, one that can be achieved only by means of satellite technology, which requires less in the way of infrastructure than if a toll system uses microwave technology. I will concede that the bad experiences that the Germans are currently having have not been much help in achieving acceptance of this principle. That is one reason why Mrs Sommer, who may indeed have been more in favour of such a system, could not plead its cause, as she always had one eye on the press reports from Germany and could not go any further.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address my concluding remarks to the Commission, which will perhaps report to one of the forthcoming meetings of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on what is happening about Galileo and the satellite system. I started by describing the Commission proposal as bolder but rather more risky – the latter insofar as we are dependent on a satellite system, Galileo in particular. It appears to me that there will be major problems with using the satellite-based system in Europe, for I hear that the Americans are bringing certain pressure to bear – we are having separate and specific talks with them – concerning the American influence on the system, which is being made somewhat less precise, and can, if it comes to that, even be switched off. I do not know whether the Commissioner wants to say something about this at the end of this debate or whether she will be able, when next the opportunity arises, to report to the committee on the actual state of play in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to revisit the objective of this directive, which is, of course, the interoperability of electronic toll collection systems. It is, however, abundantly clear that the real objective goes deeper than this, namely the internalisation of the external environmental costs. Amendments have been tabled to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the key problems surrounding traffic still exist. Now, more than four years after I entered this House, those discussions are still going on. The problems are obvious: the environment, noise, emissions, congestion, lack of safety – I could go on in this vein for some time. These problems are inextricably linked to economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly all transport economists are in agreement that the use of tolls to restrict and influence traffic is the only way to tackle that problem. Today’s headlines in the Netherlands read: ‘Tolls at different levels help counter tailbacks’. This is the theory, but the heart of the problem, does, of course, lie to some extent with the Council of Ministers. At the beginning of this month, we received the report from the Council of Ministers that the ministers and transport ministers, at all levels, are hopelessly undecided about collection on a per-kilometre basis. I heard the proposals from Mrs Peijs, formerly an MEP, and currently Transport Minister in the Netherlands, which are tantamount to ‘flat-rate collection’.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is collection based on price, location, and type of vehicle and on a whole list of other things. This requires modern technology. We nonetheless share the rapporteur’s view that, at present, we should not simply, <span class="italic">en passant</span>, ditch such things as microwave communication. That is taking matters too far. I also think that we are taking matters one step too far by using this so-called Galileo technology. Why do we insist on doing this? GSM and GPS technology already exists, and GPS2 is only around the corner. The discussion surrounding Galileo is sufficiently known; we have had it here too. What we are about to receive now, is a sort of truck system, which I do not regard as strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the examples in Switzerland, and at the <span class="italic">autostradas</span>, and so on, we conclude that we require an abundance of forward-looking technology. In my opinion, we should not only have Galileo, but also perhaps GSM. It should also be compatible, as we have agreed before. We would make a great deal of progress with this, and we hope that we can solve this future problem. I urge the transport ministers in any case to speak out about the way in which we use the money, whether we transfer money or not, what we collect for, for example, improving rail systems and so on, in other words ‘cross pricing’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that this proposal for a directive will serve to simplify and, therefore, to some extent to promote the widespread use of systems of charging by means of tolls, rights of use and other means, but the subject of the directive is not so much charging as the interoperability of the different systems. For us, this was a goal which really was indispensable, in that only by guaranteeing interoperability can barriers to trade and potential distortions of the internal market be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, what we are doing is not supporting exploitative or technological monopolies but establishing the indispensable need for interoperability. I have no objection to resolute investment in pioneering technologies or the satellite sector as set out by the rapporteur. I have listened on a number of occasions to objections relating to the ‘Big Brother’ risk. I am no advocate of ‘Big Brother’, but, quite frankly, I would not like it whatever country it came from. It would not be right for any of us to be totally indifferent to Mr Bush’s ‘Big Brother’ and to be concerned solely about the European ‘Big Brother’, although, clearly, if I have to choose between them, I would choose the European branch of the family.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: the interoperability obligation must apply to contractual regulations too. We have to make things simpler for users and taxpayers too, with clear rules which make contractual relationships and regulations applying to individual operators flexible and open to common use by all operators. Legal, fiscal and other barriers make the obligatory reference to a single-contract system more complex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can be best achieved by the introduction, where appropriate and where there is local support, of charging schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Congestion charging plays a key role in combating congestion, pollution and global warming. The successful and popular Central London charging scheme is an example of this new approach and represents the most ambitious urban road pricing scheme in Europe. Other towns and cities in the UK are pursuing similar initiatives. For lorries, Labour in the UK advocates the introduction of a lorry user charge, which is to be introduced in 2006 and, incidentally, is strongly supported by the main haulage-trade associations. Therefore, whilst we fully support the principle of interoperability of toll systems, it is essential that these pioneering British initiatives are not in any way prejudiced. We therefore support EU action to agree minimum technical standards to permit interoperability of tolling technology, so as to avoid vehicle owners having to install a number of separate units, with obvious consequences regarding cost and inconvenience.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be wrong to prescribe the type of technology. We therefore welcome the Sommer report and would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, which fully addresses these concerns, seeking compatibility rather than rigidly prescribing the type of technology, which should rightly be left to the market or, under the principle of subsidiarity, to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One area where there could be clarification is the role of regional and local authorities, and we urge Members to support Amendment No 45, which makes it clear that is the appropriate level for decision-making in some cases. We also advocate support for Amendment No 44, which seeks to clarify that onboard equipment is not compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us all make it clear that if we adopt this report tomorrow we are not forcing <span class="italic">any</span> Member State or local authority to charge motorists or hauliers. We are reasonably and sensibly seeking to ensure compatibility between schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rapporteur, I believe that the Commission proposal must contribute to the smoother operation of the internal market. From the users’ point of view, then, the directive could facilitate toll charging in the various Member States, eliminating waiting times and consequently increasing capacities for infrastructure use.</p>
<p class="contents">The current system, specifically as regards international freight hauliers, who might be obliged to acquire separate devices, each with its own contract and to install them in their vehicles, makes no sense at all. I wish, however, to make a few observations on some points that I feel are relevant and to which, I believe, this House must pay particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the need to make it perfectly clear that the directive does not affect Member States’ freedom to decide on their own system of infrastructure charging for roads. The directive only covers the charging system and does not include road-charging policy as such. Furthermore, and as regards the timetable for interoperability, I share the rapporteur’s view that this should start on 1 January 2007, because this date would guarantee sufficient and necessary time for the industry and those managing infrastructures to define and install equipment that meets the new standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to emphasise that the directive must not ignore essential elements on which its success depends. These are: creating awareness-raising activities for users as regards technological developments, implementing legal procedures for monitoring and preventing fraud, analysing types of compensation for investments that have been made or which are being made by operators in parallel technological, financial or commercial processes whose viability is threatened by the requirement to switch to the new system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our essential need is for a toll system that is compatible right across Europe and built to a standard that will last into the future. Europe has, since the 1990s, seen the introduction of a multitude of different toll systems, all stitched together in a patchwork, and there would be many more patches were it not for this directive. The directive is intended to make it possible, in future, to get right across Europe with one technological item and one contract, and what that means is that the systems will have to be compatible by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking further ahead, it recommends the introduction of a satellite-based toll system and, at the same time, calls on the Commission to submit, by 2009, a strategy for the conversion of the services. That was what our group had demanded, and I am glad that we have the rapporteur’s backing in this. Why are we recommending a satellite-based toll system? We do so because it has the potential to add value to our transport policy. If I might use a rather laboured analogy, I do not buy a typewriter and then a computer if I am going to be putting my documents on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future, firstly, because it can – provided that the political will is present – provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles, and, secondly, because – as my colleague Mr Swoboda said – it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked. Thirdly, it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services, such as, for example, rapid help in the event of accidents, local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods, to name but a few. Perhaps the Commission should have put greater emphasis on these technical considerations. I would be happy if we could complete this directive within the life of this Parliament; after first reading would be best of all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we have another buzzword: the European Union is no longer to regulate every detail of everything, but it is to concentrate primarily on the interoperability of systems. Unfortunately, though, we often do not adhere to this principle, and that is the problem in this instance, but not with the directive itself, of which there has already been much criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a system for the future, admittedly one whose target date is a long way in the distance. As the Commissioner said, the only thing is that it probably will not work, and that is not what we want. We need workable systems – note the plural – that must be in place, that must work, and must be interoperable. I have nothing against satellite technology, and there is much to be said for it, but not when it is like this. Is the collapse in Germany not enough for us? What we need right now is technological neutrality, and we will carry on needing it for a number of years. Looked at from that angle, we must warmly thank our rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for, at an early stage – which was the right one – steering the committee’s discussions in the direction that we need, concentrating on the need to guarantee interoperability, above all, too, on making things simpler for the user, and on ensuring that the system can work.</p>
<p class="contents">That leads me also to warmly thank Mr Turmes, who was right to warn us against losing our grip on reality when dealing with the topic of tolls and toll systems. When he started speaking, it almost sounded as if he were already talking about ecopoints, which are the next item on the agenda, but I can agree with him on that and also on what he has said on this item for discussion: we should not get airborne over this. Let us ensure that there are workable systems for our transport system as a whole, or else we may end up organising some things better, but we will be wrecking many more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an MEP representing London, I obviously have concerns about the way that this report may affect the very successful congestion charge scheme that has been operating in London for the past year or so. We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are two things I still want to talk about. One is that, at the moment, the London scheme does not use microwave technology, but may well move towards doing that. This would require onboard units and will bring the scheme very much under this directive. If we are then required to move to some kind of satellite system, that really would cause enormous problems, because satellite systems are not designed for urban environments and there would be difficulties of visibility – of actually seeing traffic in the way that is required. There is also the matter of barriers and, obviously, a city requires a barrier-free environment. So, if we move to satellite technology there could be very real technical problems in operating it, not only in London but also in other urban environments which may introduce similar schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are extremely concerned about this and the effects that this directive might have on what is still a new scheme in London but one that has been extremely successful. The London congestion charge has reduced significantly the amount of traffic going into the centre, with the obvious benefits for the environment, etc. Therefore, I hope we will get the assurances that we are seeking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are necessary. It is just a question of how we can minimise the bother they cause and the costs that result.</p>
<p class="contents">Various systems have now been introduced at local and national level, but they are not compatible. Obviously, to avoid problems, they have to be harmonised. The excellent aim of this Commission proposal is that each and everyone should have just one contract and every vehicle just one box, for the internal market to function properly. This is only reasonable. I agree with Mrs Sommer that the interoperability of road tolls is the objective, rather than the means of achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would disagree somewhat with the Commission: in my opinion, we need to be more flexible as far as local authorities are concerned, because then good, viable schemes already in operation would not have to be scrapped just because satellite systems are being adopted too rapidly. The fact that the systems should be mutually functional is the goal, not that they should work using microwaves or any other waves. That is why it is sufficient that general requirements should be determined to achieve the basic object of the directive, which is the interoperability of the systems. That is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">A dynamic Europe needs road transport. An ever more affluent Europe needs mobility. Good though it might be that we standardise these systems, we must also make sure that we keep costs at a reasonable level and do not voluntarily place ourselves in a straitjacket. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course tempting to talk about tolls as if they were quite self-explanatory, for there are so many aspects to them. The regulation they provide can benefit the environment; they can promote safety; they also produce income, and one can of course have exciting discussions about what is to be done with it. I believe, though, that we would be ill-advised to confuse the two issues, as we will have the opportunity to discuss the first of them later on, so let us concentrate on the technology. Past experience has taught us that discussing this is extremely useful. We have ourselves seen the chaos that can result if each country insists on using its own recipe for technology, and Toll Collect in Germany was a good example of that. I do not believe that monopolies provide the answer in this area; we should simply aim to have good technology, and I believe that the Commission proposal and what the rapporteur has suggested are going the right way about achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘one contract per user’ principle is, I believe, desirable and will remain so. Unlike Mrs Honeyball and Mr Watts, I do not live in London, but at a distance of seven kilometres from two countries, and I can tell you that it would be a nightmare for HGV drivers among others if they had to reckon on needing to install in their vehicles a different monitoring system for each country. That is not on, and I believe that we should, in future, outlaw it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the technology should not be too precisely specified, but should, quite simply, be reliable, efficient and compatible; in other words, its interoperability must be guaranteed. Past experience has shown us what we have coming to us if these criteria are not met.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, I hope that, whatever system is introduced, we will not repeat the experience we have had only recently. Haulage operators sacrificed thousands of working hours in installing systems, only for a country and a region to then decide to do without them. There is neither point nor purpose to such an exercise, which, I believe, completely fails to achieve something that I regard as a very good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be our mission to encourage the taking of still greater steps, but the committee’s report is a disappointment as far as that is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the committee considers the issue from many angles but does not question the fact that the system only applies to commercial transport. Secondly, the committee still seems to think that road tolls should cover the costs of road maintenance. Thirdly, with the approach the committee is proposing the EU will not achieve sufficient lift-off as far as sustainable development is concerned. I now want to go into rather more detail regarding these three factors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the adoption of road toll systems one has to be wary of a situation where an increase in private transport completely cancels out the benefit of a reduction in commercial transport. The only sustainable solution is for the system to apply to all road transport in the same way right from the start. This solution is not unfair to private motorists because satellite positioning equipment is rapidly becoming more and more common in cars. There will be a significant proportion of them by 2008 when the European Galileo system becomes operational.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to take the external costs of traffic into account so that with any road toll imposed the marginal cost matches the ceiling amount charged. In this way traffic would not have to pay the present external cost, but one based on a new balanced charge that reflects the volume of traffic. What should therefore be regarded as the prime objective is that the volume of traffic on a route or in a zone where charges apply is at an optimal level at different times and that what constitutes that optimal level is determined by market mechanisms. In my view these conditions will be met most easily with satellite positioning systems and that is why we should venture to agree, as the Commission has proposed, to adopt this technology promptly as a basis for a European system. In this way bringing technology onto the market will also mean large-scale benefits that transport companies above all will enjoy in terms of decreasing costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I imagine people are muttering to themselves about the inadequacy of legislative powers. I would remind them, however, of the ever greater part traffic plays as a producer of carbon dioxide emissions. Although the car industry, with EU support, has done and is doing important work to develop low emission vehicles there is good reason to introduce road toll systems specifically to reduce emissions. I refer to Article 174 of the Treaty on European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Microwave technology is in competition with satellite positioning and mobile communications, and important amendments now indicate its advantages in comparison with other systems. To be sure, there are parallel systems over stretches of road, and perhaps not only for a transitional period, but the simple fact is that progressive conversion to satellite positioning and mobile communications technology offers a more realistic prospect of achieving interoperability and hence guaranteeing the absence of problems with road traffic by means of a working system of toll collection and without excessively expensive investments in infrastructure. We have already heard how, in the sphere of satellite positioning the European satellite navigation system Galileo, which is currently under construction, will, from 2008 onwards, provide information of superior quality to that provided by the present-day GPS and will be ideally suited to telematics services in road traffic. This is about using the opportunities opened up to us by Galileo in the area of toll charging.</p>
<p class="contents">Not in any way, though, is this about using toll-collecting technology as a means of justifying the extension of Galileo. Let us not make the mistake of taking the disaster that befell the introduction of German lorry tolls as a reason not to give toll charging by satellite a chance. That would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It does not follow that there has to be repetition of the financial failures, bad luck and accidents that attended the introduction of the German HGV tolls, so let us keep our cool. As I have said, I do not favour the mandatory introduction of satellite-based toll charging systems, but I do have confidence that, at the end of the day, the best system will prevail on the market, for that is what is demanded by the interests of the matter in hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, Loyola,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for the wonderful work she has done, and express my gratitude for the discussions and progress which have resulted from the joint work of the three institutions with a view to achieving approval at first reading, because I believe that the objections we had in relation to some of the points which had been adopted in the first report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have been entirely altered by means of certain compromise amendments which are acceptable to the Commission and which I also believe will be acceptable to the Council when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that tomorrow, with the ratification by this plenary of the rapporteur’s suggestions, we may see the approval by the Council of Parliament’s proposal, which – I would insist – the Commission could accept in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to reply briefly to some of the concerns expressed by the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the issue of subsidiarity, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you that this is guaranteed. What we are essentially proposing is a single legal contract, which allows for a payment for the use of an infrastructure, wherever that use takes place, at the place of origin, from the user's current account. In other words, for example, just as the charges for the use of a mobile phone or a credit card in any part of the European Union are subsequently charged to our bank accounts, we are trying to create a similar situation for road tolls: that the use of an infrastructure in a third country is charged to our bank account.</p>
<p class="contents">This will have to be done by means of contracts and with sufficient guarantees, as in the sectors I have mentioned as examples.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to do that not only do we need a single contract but also we need to make progress in order to take full advantage of these conditions in relation to the interoperability and compatibility of systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, despite the fact that Mrs Sommer and certain other speakers have said that it is premature to commit ourselves now to a system – such as the satellite system, which has not been fully tested – and that I believe we could perhaps have made more progress, the final result of the debate we have held is positive. I also believe that a strong recommendation for the future in favour of the Galileo system sends an appropriate message to the whole sector which is going to invest, which is investing or intends to implement the Galileo system and, therefore, we are providing support for the Galileo system – which is a European system – with the necessary flexibility so that each country can, nevertheless, take the corresponding measures, provided that they are compatible and interoperable, although there may possibly be other solutions in the event that there are, for example, problems relating to investments, the repayment of investments, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">To reply very briefly to the question from Mr Swoboda on the negotiations with the United States, I would like to take this opportunity to say that they are moving ahead very positively. In recent times, in relation to the problem of overlapping of frequencies, we have now fully resolved – in a way which is satisfactory to both parties – the overlapping of code M of the American GPS – which is the maximum security code – with our own signal – the closed security signal, reserved for public authorities within the Galileo system – and we have found formulae which have in no way prejudiced the quality of the Galileo system and which at the same time offer the security guarantees called for by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains for us to resolve the overlapping which occurs – according to the Americans – between our open signal and one of their signals. We have made it very clear that what we cannot accept is the United States’ initial proposal – which means moving from 1 5 1 5 (which is what we would like) to 1 1 (the Americans’ preference) – because we believe the quality of our service would be greatly reduced. Furthermore, we believe that on 1 5 we do not create security problems for the American security system. In any event, we are bringing these discussions to an end, but I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no greater difficulties arise and that we will have a complete solution, since almost all the issues have practically been resolved, something I am extremely happy about. To this we should add the interest expressed by countries such as China, India, Brazil and other third countries in participating in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue I would like to mention very briefly is the case of London, although we could consider other cities. Ladies and gentlemen, the field in which we demand interoperability and compatibility does not apply to the London toll, amongst other reasons, firstly, because it is a local area, which does not fall within our competences and above all because in London no equipment is installed. Furthermore, it is pointed out that it would not be applied in cases in which the intended objective implies an excessive or unbalanced cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying that, for the sake of conciseness and in order to ensure precision in an area of a highly technical nature, we believe that we should partially revise the wording – not the substance – of Amendments Nos 2, 14, 18 and 32. Apart from that, Mr President, it only remains for me to thank Mrs Sommer for her wonderful work and the honourable Members for your cooperation and to sum up by saying that this is the technological system which later on will allow us to appropriately apply the Eurovignette Directive. Today we are not talking about tolls as such, but of methods for charging tolls more simply, which create fewer problems for the users and which facilitate the operation of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
