<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, I may be a bit longer than normal, but Rio was not short either. I would like to start by thanking the Members of the Parliament who, despite many difficulties, decided to join the conference in their personal capacity. I appreciate the exchanges we had during the conference and I am pleased that you can now share your impressions of the complex negotiations with other honourable Members too.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to recognise up front that the Rio+20 outcomes document is less ambitious than what the European Union had planned and wanted. However, after long negotiations, the European Union and its Member States decided to support its adoption as a step in the right direction. There are a number of areas where the European Union would have hoped for a more ambitious outcome. This applies, for instance, to setting concrete timelines for the specific commitments in the priority areas, or to institutional aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, the final outcome still remains close to a range of initial objectives of the EU and, more importantly, it provides a basis for further work in the right direction if properly implemented. But this must be done with a sense of urgency, because the planet and the poorest in the world cannot afford any delays. This is why we decided that it is better to have this agreement than no agreement at all. As you know, the challenges are global as are, in many cases, the solutions and we need to continue working with our partners also in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome document acknowledges the important role of an inclusive green economy in achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication. It is recognised as an important tool for achieving sustainable development for all countries. It will enhance our ability to manage natural resources sustainably, increase resource efficiency and reduce waste. It relates to changing the way we consume and produce today to adapt our economies to the boundaries of our planet and to allow future generations to meet their own needs. Overall support for this was confirmed by a number of countries during months of preparations and by positive references to the green economy in the final statements made by most Heads of State, including Heads of State from the majority of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The document also recognises the need for broader measures of progress to complement GDP in order to have more solid policy decisions, as well as the importance of corporate sustainable reporting. The outcome document provides the necessary basis to turn these words into actions at various levels. At a time when our society suffers widespread unemployment, we are also satisfied that Rio+20 was given a stronger social angle to sustainable development on matters such as decent work, green jobs and social protection floors, thereby enhancing the linkages between its three dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also contributed actively to highlighting that democracy, human rights, the rule of law, good governance and gender equality and empowerment of women are indispensable to achieve sustainable development. These are the European values we will never back off from. The fact that these concepts have been made more operational at Rio, for instance, in relation to the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, is important progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning civil society and the private sector, the European Union has fought for and secured a good outcome in relation to the fundamental role of civil society and stakeholders in the realisation of sustainable development. We will keep working throughout the next reforms to increase their participation in the decision-making process. In the new UNEP, for instance, we have agreed to ensure the active participation of all relevant stakeholders and to explore new mechanisms to promote transparency and the effective engagement of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight that Rio Principle 10 on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice has been extended at Rio+20 from environmental matters to sustainable development as a whole. The inclusive green economy can bring fundamental changes to progress towards sustainable development because it will change the economic fabric. We have seen enormous engagement by the private sector in Rio. This gives me hope that the top-down endorsement, even if weaker than we wanted, and the strong bottom-up movement, will actually bring about change faster than we could have hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">The private sector, if given the direction and framework ensuring public goods, can create investment, prosperity and well-being, decent employment and green jobs and help to promote sharing of know-how and development and diffusion of innovative technology. This will be fundamental to the necessary mobilisation of all means of implementation from all sources. This is the key to moving away from focus on the official development assistance approach alone.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads us to the means of implementation, and that is also why the European Union has taken the position that first and foremost, each country must take the necessary measures to put in place an enabling environment of domestic policies that is designed to be self-sustaining.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, progress towards sustainable development entails providing the right financial instruments. We repeated our commitment to official development assistance, but order alone is not the answer. Public and private funding and business expertise should go hand in hand in establishing appropriate financing strategies. Innovative sources of financing should be encouraged and emerging economies should take a stronger role proportionate to their evolving international status.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, moving towards more sustainable development also depends on skills, know-how and technology diffusion. In this regard, the European Union research framework programmes are open to all countries, including support for researchers in developing countries. The green economy can also make a real difference in the development and diffusion of green technologies to the countries having most natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">On the goals, targets and SDGs,<span class="bold"> t</span>he European Union has made efforts to make the text more operational, including by proposing goals and targets with timelines in several areas, as you know. We have not obtained the timelines we sought, with exceptions such as the commitment to achieve sustainable reduction of marine litter by 2025, but the EU has achieved the integration of most of its proposed targets into the main text in the form of express commitments, for example, on future action concerning extending the protection of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">This has reinforced the text to make it more action-orientated. These efforts of the European Union to focus attention on key issues such as sustainable energy, water, oceans, land and biodiversity, food security and resource efficiency, should also bear fruit in the next month in the process to develop sustainable development goals or SDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision at Rio to develop SDGs and make them operational is indeed one of the main outcomes of Rio+20. For the EU, the work on SDGs should be coordinated and coherent with the review process of the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, without deviating from efforts towards their achievement by 2015. It would be important to have an overarching framework for post-2015 that encompasses the three dimensions of sustainable development with goals that address key challenges in a holistic and coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the agreement to launch the SDG process also means bringing a fresh impetus to a concept that was shown to be at risk at Rio. I refer to sustainable development taken as a holistic notion. Indeed, at Rio+20, in spite of initial difficulties, we have reaffirmed the need to put together our efforts to eradicate poverty and to secure sustainability within our planetary limits. In retrospect, reaffirming the holistic vision was more important than we initially thought in view of the resistance from many sides to continuing to address these two matters in conjunction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the institutional framework, overall, we welcome the agreement to reinforce the institutional framework for sustainable development. Rio has reinforced international environmental governance by strengthening and upgrading UNEP. It will now have universal membership and must become our common home to set the global environmental agenda. In this new set-up, a truly global UNEP will have a new authority that will allow it to take actions that were, until now, beyond its reach. We have already started the strategic reflection on this new potential strength. We will, however, continue to work together with our partners towards the creation of a fully-fledged United Nations environmental organisation to allow it to function on an equal footing with other UN organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The other institutional reform is the decision to establish a new high-level political forum on sustainable development which will replace the Commission on Sustainable Development. It should allow the regular participation of Heads of State in reviewing the progress of all our commitments. The EU has ensured that it will have most of the functions required and it will be important to make sure that this reform brings real change.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, at Rio we reaffirmed that we share the same planet and that we share the same common responsibility towards future generations. None of the countries and regions present at Rio achieved in full what was wanted initially. This also applies to the European Union, but we have worked together with all the other countries to develop common ground, and it is a fact that the document would be less ambitious and less concrete without hard work and also commitment from many who worked on the side of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rio+20 has not gone as far as most Europeans would have wanted, but the key message today is that we agreed on many useful elements, many more than first reactions would lead us to believe, and this is why we should now focus on implementing them and building on them. The fate of the question of whether Rio+20 was a failure or a success is actually still in our hands. It will depend on what we do with it from this point in time in implementing it in full.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission intends to do the necessary to build on what has been agreed at the highest level. We are looking forward to the European Parliament’s view on how this can be best done, and count on you to keep the ambition and positive energy generated in the run-up to Rio alive in the years to come at international, national and also local levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The global transition to a sustainable model of development is obviously far from easy, and that was what Rio was actually all about. It demands courage, vision, coherence, trust-building, but also time, which we do not have in abundant quantities, due to the urgency of the challenges we are facing, but that transition is simply inevitable. So, instead of repeating what Rio did not deliver, let us rather join forces, find friends, find partners who share our analysis and also our determination, and start to deliver many of the ideas mentioned in the Rio document, in Europe and also globally. Nobody is actually preventing us from doing so, and time is running on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should mainly like to focus on the following question: why have we been so disappointed? I was in Rio 20 years ago as a young MEP and I would have welcomed the opportunity to attend the Rio+20 conference 20 years later. The committee, in its wisdom, however, decided not to travel and, out of solidarity, I stayed away too. Commissioner, how could it happen that the technicians who were in Rio one week before you had almost signed off on a finished result, while the parliamentarians had no opportunity to intervene in relation to the substance of the agreement? This is what I have been told and this is also what I hear from your office.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that the three pillars of the environment, the economy and social affairs are now fundamental components within the United Nations, as this is part and parcel of a socially and environmentally responsible economy. As you have pointed out yourself, Commissioner, we do not have much time left, which is why I am broaching the subject now. We must ensure that what was agreed in Rio, even if it was not very much, is finally put into action.</p>
<p class="contents">We should then first turn to the question of whether we need to place the UN and our contribution to UN environmental and climate policy on a completely new footing. This is something we have called for in all climate conferences. We need a more efficient target. We do not need other people to tell us how difficult it is to put forward a single opinion when one has 27 Member States. How much more difficult must it be to organise an opinion with 192 countries? That is difficult and absolute unanimity is not possible. That is why we need a different organisational format for these issues, so that those who want to move forward can do so, but under orderly conditions, so that Europe’s competitiveness is not permanently damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what interests me personally in this question is the fact that we in Europe have a marked tendency to come up with a new dossier every week. The Directorate General for Climate Action has now placed a land use paper on the table. We only have a couple of weeks in which to discuss this. The paper will have a dramatic influence on the way land is managed in Europe. Why, Commissioner, do we not finally take the step of implementing something that was agreed on many years ago? We have directives on plant protection and fertiliser use, we have an erosion protection programme, we have a Habitats Directive for flora and fauna, a Water Framework Directive and a directive on air quality systems. Why not implement these? If we were to do this, we would look a lot better in the eyes of the rest of the world at future conferences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No binding document, no definition of the future we want, but of course, without Mr Obama, Mr Cameron and Ms Merkel – who alone represent more than 30% of the entire gross domestic product and who were, in fact, in Mexico at the G20 summit – what could have been decided? Only safe ideas for those who want business as usual, such as the green economy, masterfully represented as one of the instruments available in order to achieve sustainable growth, and for the adoption of policies, which should not, however, be subject to rigid rules. The divisions, inconsistencies and injustices will therefore remain and the separation of economic, social and environmental spheres will continue to cause disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes to recognising climate change, reducing natural disasters, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and yet nothing concrete – as if to say, the house is burning and we are not doing anything to put out the fire. Other evident sticking points: that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did not become a real environment body and that no High Commissioner was appointed for future generations. What can we do now? Only be aware that interdependence can help us cope with the crisis we are experiencing and therefore that a new governance is absolutely necessary in order to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could set an example: get the financial institutions responsible for a large part of this crisis around a table and ask them to commit to a plan of growth, inclusion, fairness and development, which respects and protects the environment and people. For its part, Parliament can come up with a universal statement of interdependence and democracy, which also guarantees right of access to natural resources and then ask the biggest States in the world to join in. For once, it would not be up to the young people or banks or large corporations, but the democratically elected representatives to decide the future we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had high hopes that Rio+20 would deliver something that we need in this world, but we have to be realistic. The Rio+20 document is a huge disappointment and a huge missed opportunity. What is quite threatening is that the EU was totally isolated in Rio. There were several reasons for this. First of all, the developing world, along with the United States of America, does not want any restrictions on its growth ambitions. Secondly – and I am still not certain whether this is really the case – the EU might have realised too late that the rest of the world considered Rio+20 a social summit instead of a sustainability summit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not only pessimistic about Rio. I felt there was a growing awareness that business as usual will not deliver the growth that countries need, and that greening the economy is a necessity. Even the countries that were deliberately trying to get rid of all ambitions in the final outcome were, at the same time, working on the ground, with organisations like the United Nations Environment Programme, to green their own economies. I think that is a very promising development.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, it is important to consider how to move forward. I strongly believe that the EU needs a very pragmatic approach. We have to establish bilateral partnerships with countries that want to green their economy: for example, on trade relations, giving preferential treatment to countries that want to green their economies through our development policy – and it was a good thing that Development Commissioner Piebalgs was present in Rio. This is the type of approach that we need, and I think that, at the multilateral level, the EU can also play a crucial role in pursuit of the sustainable development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the top-down approach did not work. I think it is time for a much stronger bottom-up approach which includes the business community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it!</p>
<p class="contents">This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of the Rio Summit was to make specific agreements and guidelines on sustainable and social development and poverty reduction. Despite the high cost and the fuss, the summit has clearly not worked. Prior to the summit, Parliament emphasised the necessary measures to increase the use of renewable energies and improve energy efficiency worldwide, highlighting that this did not mean nuclear power, because that is not a sustainable source.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the conference, I also called for much less deforestation, especially in Latin America. The equivalent of 36 football pitches are being cleared of trees every minute worldwide, with much of this activity taking place in Brazil. It is therefore strange than virtually nothing has been agreed on this issue in Rio de Janeiro of all places. If we fail to do that now, then when are we going to do it? The same goes for Europe. The rainforests in Latin America are being cut down in order to grow GMOs for the European market. Europe is thus partly responsible for this importation of soya and ought to curb it. If it did, we could at least then save a couple of football pitches per minute.</p>
<p class="contents">Just briefly on gender equality. The UN’s outcome document is completely meaningless. When are we finally going to address gender equality in the context of sustainable development? Millions of women are waiting for an answer. I hope that, in the EU policy, we will simply stick to the ambitious plans we had before and not descend to the level of Rio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The assessments made by some NGOs and by a number of speakers here sometimes remind me of the assessment of wishes for the New Year: the more you wish for, the more you seem to have achieved. I believe, however, that what counts is what one has genuinely achieved at the end of the year, rather than what one wishes for and resolves to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the long-term trends of the last 20 years, it is evident that we have achieved quite a lot. That must also be acknowledged. If we consider access to drinking water, we will see that we are almost on the point of achieving our targets, while things do not look too bad for waste water treatment either. Nonetheless, the problem remains of how we can help the developing world and sustain it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is also necessary, however, to face up to realities. A great deal has changed in the world in the last 20 years. The countries that were more or less on the threshold of development, for example, China and many of the G77 states, have become very strong. That is why the approach of taking action within the United Nations system is certainly justified. I am not so sure, however, that the upgrading of the United Nations Environment Programme to a fully-fledged UN organisation is really the panacea we seek.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the green economy, I might remind you that we really do seem to be blind in one eye. The point there, too, is that we must involve the private sector on a massive scale, rather than just hoping to achieve success on a top-down basis using the old systems, in other words, development aid. That is why it is so important to take a realistic approach. Europe has achieved a lot here as a driving force, and should remain a driving force. I do not think it is right to start criticising everything at this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be said however, that, in the final analysis, the result achieved in Rio is fairly unimpressive. Mr Prodi expressed our disappointment in a nutshell, calling it Rio minus 20! Some NGOs described the result the same way. What has been achieved in the conference is really very little indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to consider whether there is much point holding conferences in this format. We have been through Copenhagen, which was a disaster, and now we have had Rio+20: we are moving from one disappointment to the next. I think that the upgrading of the UN Environment Programme, putting it on an almost equal footing with the WHO, is the right approach, as it will give this organisation more authority and more enforcement powers than was previously the case. This is a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to witness the world’s population grow to 9 billion. We are heading for a catastrophe if things keep going like this. If more and more people live in industrialised nations and want access to energy and if we do not take radical steps to avert this, we shall encounter enormous problems. That is why we need a new development strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been no public debate on this issue, even in advance of Rio. When I consider what we voted on yesterday – ACTA – and the number of e-mails and letters, etc. we received on this issue, then I believe that we also need to move towards a sustainable planet in the digital community too. After all, this world is the only one we have got. We can play our part here by changing our strategy and bringing more people along with us, and then perhaps the Angela Merkels of this world will travel to the next summit and really put their heads together to produce concrete results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is truly paradoxical that all the Heads of State or Government who were present – few in number but present nonetheless – recognised the seriousness of the situation and, at the same time, were totally powerless to act. Perhaps more importantly, the lawyers are at the stage of proposing a principle of non-regression in environmental law, while for thirty or forty years we have been pushing, and those very same lawyers have been pushing, for progress in environmental law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear that we cannot remain in this situation and that we need to re-examine our governance at global level. Even if the powers of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) are extended, this programme is not a global environmental organisation. We need an international criminal court dealing exclusively with environmental law to address crimes which may be committed and offences which cannot be tried, and I reaffirm this very solemnly.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you have said a lot about the bottom up approach. It is quite clear that we must find another way of working with civil society, which, in many countries, is the driving force, through a sequence of small operations, behind the change we all need and which safeguards, albeit sometimes modestly, the general interest, so that civil society can be represented in the negotiations, exert its influence, make proposals and take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to review the whole issue of governance. This will enable us to truly put in place a green economy, to ensure that global trade is not abandoned to total freedom regardless of social and environmental rules and, lastly, it will enable Europe to fully play its role once again. Today, the European Union is regarded as the sick man of the global economy. Well, we must spearhead the green economy and the ability to overcome national egoisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can actually conclude that, 20 years ago, it was politics that led the way. Now, however, in 2012, as politicians, we are hopelessly out of touch with the trends and changes we see in society. And, if you are a politician, that is a painful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we should also critically examine Europe’s role. Did Europe play its hand well in Rio de Janeiro? Firstly, the question: did Europe put forward its ‘green economy’ agenda in a timely way? What do we mean by that? And is it not the case that, for some countries in Europe, a green economy mainly means business as usual, with a little bit of green round the edges, rather than a genuine transition to a new economy, which is how you think about it. However, we all know that Europe is far from being unanimous on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also Europe’s second problem: credibility. In Rio de Janeiro, we called for a real transition to a new economy. But what are we doing ourselves? Look at how we are trying to get out of this crisis. It is business as usual<span class="italic">.</span> Even the Commission is just handing out more money for the construction of new roads in Greece, as if that were the way we are supposed to extricate ourselves from this crisis? That is too narrow an approach!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what did we bring to Rio? We asked for the world, but ultimately we had too little to bring. We now have to do two things and they are very simple. To demonstrate ourselves that we really are serious about the green economy and, secondly, to make a real step towards that new economy, in the company of the countries which actually want to achieve it, like Mexico and South Korea, because the new economy can only be a green economy or else there will be nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it says much about the inconsequentiality of the agreement in Rio that it was finalised even before the meeting began’.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is a pretty fair judgment on the structure of the summit, and I hope its failure will lead to a re-evaluation of the efficacy of these set-piece events. I would ask the Commissioner to take a lead from Parliament and consider the cost to taxpayers of mass attendance. I do, however, welcome one outcome and that is the setting up of the new high-level group. It will meet regularly and, I hope, avoid future dependence on these events, concentrating on true environmental sustainability, without all the social ‘fluffy stuff’ that has been associated with the Rio talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to Parliament working closely with Commissioner Potočnik in developing what Mr Gerbrandy so eloquently described as a ‘bottom-up’ approach – an approach that I fully support. If we are disappointed with the outcome for oceans, we have our common fisheries policy. If we are disappointed with the outcome for the environment, we have our land-use policy.

The most profound of these contradictions has not always been the most visible, but it is certainly the most decisive. The globally dominant economic and social system has shown itself to be incapable of meeting the most basic needs of millions upon millions of human beings and, at the same time, it consumes and degrades the planet’s resources at a faster rate than the planet’s natural ability to replace them. Breakdown is inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, some think that it is time to pull a rabbit out of the hat. They call it the ‘green economy’. The concept’s lack of definition and ambiguity have catered to all opportunists, including those who say that they want to save the environment without changing the system that degrades and threatens it, those who say that they want to fight hunger and other social ills without addressing their underlying causes. Genuinely sustainable development based on a sustainable relationship between mankind and nature will not be possible without questioning capitalism’s laws and dogmas, however much they would like to paint it green.</p>
<p class="contents">We must break away from growth that sacrifices natural resources and the workforce, the creative and transformative energy of human beings, for the growing accumulation of profit and the private appropriation of the social wealth produced. We have to safeguard not only natural resources, but also their democratic enjoyment; defend local production, reducing the size of production and consumption cycles; restrict global free trade, which encourages increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions despite their serious economic and social consequences; protect natural terrestrial and marine ecosystems; recover degraded ecosystems, valuing the role they play in carbon cycle regulation; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but through legal means and not through mechanisms that leave these objectives at the whim of market moods.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish, Mr President, by saying that the fight for a healthy planet is inseparable from the fight for a fairer world, for the valuation of workers and for a society where the principles of democracy are placed above the laws of the so-called market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have to ask why, and the truth is that nobody believes in climate change any more. There has been no global warming for 15 years. Sea levels are not rising significantly. Countries like India, China and the USA will not sacrifice economic progress for speculative and alarmist theories about climate change and our European taxpayers will no longer pay for it.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more scientists are rejecting the alarmist case. Earlier this week in this Parliament, we heard from Professor Fritz Vahrenholt. Professor Vahrenholt has been, for decades, a German socialist politician and green activist. He has been an environmental regulator and most recently he was CEO of RWE Renewables. But after a lifetime of environmentalism, he has looked again at the facts and concluded that carbon dioxide is not a significant driver of climate change. I commend to colleagues his important book ‘The Cold Sun’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that renewable energy will become cost competitive as the price of fossil fuels rises, but the price of fossil fuels is not rising. New oil finds are coming on-stream. The world is awash with natural gas. The USA and China may soon become net exporters, and beyond shale gas we have methane hydrates which offer more energy than all other known fossil fuel reserves put together.</p>
<p class="contents">The price of electricity in the USA has halved on the back of shale gas. Natural gas in the USA is one fifth of the price in Germany. How is Europe supposed to compete with those prices?</p>
<p class="contents">We have voluntarily made decisions on energy which will marginalise and deindustrialise Europe. We are driving energy-intensive businesses with their jobs and investment out of Europe altogether. We are forcing households and pensioners into fuel poverty. We have chosen to impoverish our children and our grandchildren.

<p class="contents">In Europe, we are a leader in environmentally friendly technologies. We are a leader in the field of clean technologies and a leader in renewable energy sources. In Europe, we are leading by example – that is, the example we are setting by raising the awareness of 500 million Europeans about sustainability, a healthy environment and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">Our challenge is how to promote further research and how to apply that philosophy in real life. A lot of what is a matter of course for us is very much more remote for others. We therefore need to bring our communication in line with that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to talk in India about a low-carbon society while 500 million people there have no access to electricity. However, what we can talk about are opportunities for solar power plants and renewable energy sources. Though it is hard to say that they should no longer be allowed to use coal, we can talk about the clean technologies that we have mastered and thereby achieve identical objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, our attention should be focused primarily on the economic crisis. We cannot saw off the branches that support millions of jobs. The process of restructuring into green jobs will obviously take longer than all of us would like it to.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are heading in the right direction and the time for this is ripe. Parliament and Commissioner Potočnik have invested a lot of energy and commitment into ensuring that global political commitment becomes more tangible. The conference in Rio has partially contributed to this. The cheapest and most effective cure for a lack of political commitment is the global awareness of people. Informed people will help speed up political commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see the glass as half empty rather than half full because the world continues to be ravaged and we have still failed to identify sufficient specific objectives and schedules or concrete obligations to enable us to change course in favour of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The shift in power evident in Rio has been remarkable. It is interesting that an emerging economy like Brazil, supported by China and India, should present a document without there being the opportunity to change it. I would have liked to have seen more courage from Europe – acting together with the African Union perhaps – in support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exerting more pressure so that the UNEP would become a UN organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens next? Of course we have our hopes. I believe that hopes spring from the grass roots: green cities and green business. The Rio conference hosted more mayors and more CEOs than any previous environmental summit. We should identify the urban environment as a focus area in the seventh EU Environmental Action Programme. The majority of people now live in cities, which is where the greatest amount of energy and most resources are consumed, providing a good starting point. The same applies to progressive enterprises. They have understood that it is only possible to do business when the fundamental structures for commerce are in place. We need to establish an alliance with green business.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament also need to take action. The UN has established eight major groups: business, urban areas, women, trade unions, etc. Parliaments also need to become more involved, which is why it was a pity that we did not have an official delegation at the conference. We should form a major group at UN conferences under the ‘parliaments’ banner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Worse than this, the solutions emerging from Rio aim to overcome the environmental crisis by monetising the environment, through more carbon trading, free emissions bonuses and now also green property assets.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Potočnik spoke here optimistically about the inclusive green economy. How is this possible, though, when this transition would require an investment of 2% of global GDP in 10 key sectors and we know that the United Nations Environment Programme proposes acquiring these resources from the financial sector? It is a recipe for disaster! The proposed response to the environmental crisis caused by the greed of the market, which transforms resources into profit for the few and shortages for the many, is more market. Public policies are replaced by speculative mechanisms, and the common interest by private benefit. There will be no climatic, environmental and social solution without attacking the root of the problem: this economic system that condemns millions to poverty and ravages the planet. Having destroyed the global economy, big money is now being handed the planet. You do not put out a fire with petrol and you do not save the planet by selling it off bit by bit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite its 53 pages, we have very little news to report: we encourage, we emphasise, we underline, we reaffirm. What this basically comes down to is that we are calling on ourselves to finally do what we actually agreed to do years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years after the first major UN conference in Stockholm in 1972, a Dutch poet wrote: ‘All things of value are defenceless’. And now, almost 40 years down the line, we have to conclude that sustainability, environment and social rights are still not being given enough attention in our global economic system. Obviously, some steps have been taken, as the Commissioner has said, for example, in the area of marine environment. However, what will really make a difference now is the readiness to translate vague words into concrete actions. Ladies and gentlemen, some of you will not want to hear this, but the business world also has a role to play here, for example, in developing and drawing up ambitious sustainability criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Union should take the lead in translating these rather vague words into concrete actions. But, it should do it in such a way that we can spur the rest of the world into action. We have to do this internationally because, for example, our debate on whether we in Europe should move from 20% to 30% CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, now that difference equals 1.7 days’ emissions in China. So, let us deploy our efforts internationally! I wish the European Commission every success in that respect, as I do indeed to us, too. </p>
<p class="contents">Since I have about a minute left, may I remind Mr Helmer, who has, of course, already left, that the UK Government has had to adapt its plan that protects London against floods with the Thames barrier. I come from a country that saw a big flood in 1953 in which thousands of people died. I wish for the United Kingdom that the same does not happen to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Sea water levels are rising and my country and Mr Helmer’s country have to protect themselves against the North Sea, but I am afraid that Mr Helmer’s party will only recognise climate change by the time that more than one million people in the London area have wet feet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, it is often better to have a weak agreement which is fully implemented, than a wonderful agreement which is not.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let us fulfil those obligations. We have many opportunities to do so. Let us fulfil the obligation on the oceans. Let us make the world environment organisation a reality. Let us build on the momentum that has been built globally, moving beyond GDP.</p>

If you want to connect people within a protected area, there are other ways to do so other than by roads e.g. railways and waterways.</p>

For me, this is an empty shell. I remember Rio 20 years ago when it inspired all of us to get to grips with the problems at local level. I believe we are back at that stage again. We cannot wait for global leaders to stop listening to businesses and suddenly start to act quickly enough. We can only overcome the challenges that we are facing if we start from the bottom and work upwards – for people in their everyday lives to start to treat our planet and our economy differently.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a completely unsustainable economy that is entirely based on non-renewable resources, and a dramatic switch to a green economy will not mean green growth. Green growth is an illusion based on completely unrealistic ideas of the efficient use of resources. It is totally impossible to achieve. We therefore need a different economy that is genuinely green.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only achieve this if we monitor different targets. If we only measure economic activity, then that is what we will get. If we monitor other targets, the result will instead be a better planet. Let us go down that route. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The alarming consequences of the unsustainable exploitation of our planet are known to us all, while the necessary technology and knowledge is available to reverse the process. Unfortunately there is still a lack of political will, and action is frequently taken in fits and starts. Therefore, the implementation of the fine-sounding goals adopted in Rio remains our joint responsibility. In this respect, plenty of work lies ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of Hungary, János Áder, my predecessor in the European Parliament, represented Hungary at the Rio+20 conference and made the following remark: sustainable development is about us and our children, our lives and our future prospects. While it is a commonplace that water is the source of life and mankind’s greatest treasure, it is astonishing that according to the prognoses of the United Nations, by 2025, two-thirds of the Earth’s population will face continuous water supply problems. That is a shocking figure. Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a situation in which tens and hundreds of millions of children do not have access to drinking water, causing the Earth’s child mortality rates to worsen further. We cannot be so irresponsible. I believe that politicians and economic leaders need to take immediate action in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shocking figure that today, half of the world’s hospital beds are occupied by people who have fallen ill because of poor quality drinking water, and that annually, almost 2 million children under five die because of problems with drinking water supply and sewage treatment, not to mention the people, primarily in the developing world, who do not even reach hospital in order to receive hospital care. They die without even featuring in the statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union recognised the strategic importance of water early on and is leading the way towards sustainable water management. The European Union, however, cannot solve the global problems of water supply alone. That is precisely why it is in our basic interest for effective international cooperation to be established in the field of water policy, before a lack of water prompts migration waves and we are threatened by wars waged for water. Think of Mad Max, the film made by George Miller in 1979. I would not like my children to grow up in such a world, which is why I believe that we are running out of time and we all need to take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is another thing that is also clear, namely, the fact that if an agenda is about everything – because the agenda in Rio was very broad – then, in fact, it will ultimately be about nothing. We can see that in this summit’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is encouraging, however, is the genuine concern about the plastic soup in the ocean, the huge mountain of plastic waste floating on the sea. What we see now is only the tip of the iceberg, because a lot of small parts have been found in fish and birds. According to the outcome document, we need to achieve a significant reduction by 2025 and we need to take action. Can you make this more specific? Who is going to do what, when and how much will it cost? Are agreements going to be reached about the banning of free plastic bags or bottles? And if we want to lead by example, when is Europe going to do that?</p>
<p class="contents">Two more things. I have another question for you. Natural resources are mainly used for industry, energy and meat production. The outcome document is totally silent on the impact of our meat consumption and production, while increasing meat consumption is placing heavy demands on resources and on land, and rainforests are being cleared because growing animal feed requires huge areas of land. What proposals have you put forward to address this?</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of agreeing percentages at major world conferences, we want to lead by example. And the strongest incentive that Europe can now give is to show that we can get out of this crisis with green production and consumption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was 40 years ago and a great deal has happened since then. For example, there is very broad knowledge and awareness with regard to the environment and sustainable development today. Mr Helmer of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is entirely alone in his views; the majority of other people are aware that major events are happening in the area of the environment that we need to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that the measures we have decided on hitherto at international or national level have not been able to hold back the rapid changes, given the continually increasing environmental and climate-forcing stresses. Many people are disappointed by the Rio Summit, and therefore I would ask the question: what did we actually believe would happen? Do we believe that it is possible to create political pressure in connection with long-term issues of survival when the economic crisis is forcing so many people to worry about how they are going to keep body and soul together in the short term? Did we really believe that this was possible?</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe that the Rio Summit was a wake-up call, because it clearly linked issues of social justice with climate and environmental issues, and that is something that we need to bear in mind in our ongoing work. If we are to make any progress, we must now always combine social justice with questions relating to our common long-term survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The document addresses a vast range of issues from eradication of poverty to paving the way to a green economy as well as recognising, noting and acknowledging the problems that the world is facing, but it lacks a credible and concrete road map towards achieving any of those goals.</p>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, you have most of the people here, the more sensible people, who realise, in fact, that we are the custodians of the current environment and that the next generation will actually indict us unless we do something about the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to Ms de Lange and she was absolutely right in relation to Mr Helmer from the UKIP Party. He is part of a growing minority who say that there is no such thing as climate change; that nothing has changed and that there is no need to take any steps in order to rectify the situation. What world does he live in?</p>
<p class="contents">We have floods where we never had floods before. We have tornadoes where we never had tornadoes before. We have storms where we never had storms before. We have earthquakes. The ice caps are melting and, at the same time, Mr Helmer and his UKIP colleagues – as always – are running from reality and are whistling past the graveyard; and the graveyard is there to see. We have a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years ago, we had the 1992 Earth summit. If you look at the statistics in the meantime, global emissions have risen by 48%, 300 million hectares of forests have been cleared and the population of the world has increased by 1.6 billion people. Despite a reduction in poverty, one in six people are malnourished.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner, he has a very difficult job. There are conflicting commercial interests. Countries are looking to themselves and their own selfish independent interests rather than looking at the bigger question: that is, the global question.</p>
<p class="contents">So I wish you well, Commissioner. I know there has been much criticism but I think this is a step forward and I know that you have then necessary ability, the will, the commitment and the determination to ensure that you will be the Commissioner that will get universal agreement in relation to how we go forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The outcome document does recognise the importance of the green economy and stresses a number of vital issues, such as the need to improve gender equality and engage civil society. However, the overall commitments are worryingly minimal and disappointing, not least in terms of lacking a timeframe for the implementation of the objectives. In this respect, the outcome document can hardly be seen as an instrument for the achievement of a green and socially inclusive economy and for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is highly regrettable that while the participating countries recognise the need to integrate reproductive health into national strategies, the language of reproductive rights was not expressed in the outcome document. In short, there is some limited added value in the 700-plus commitments voiced at the conference, but they do not translate into a concrete action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could be said that it was not Rio+20 but Rio-20. The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse, with a text devoid of clear-cut commitments, which reveals behind the scenes that we are not in control of the new international balances.</p>
<p class="contents">With the absence of Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Vladimir Putin, the disappointment was even worse than the bother. The fiasco of Copenhagen on climate change is back to haunt us. The green economy, which was a central theme of the conference, was reduced to its simplest expression. However, that was only to expected at a time of economic and ecological crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was unconvincing. It once again found itself marginalised with regard to the BRIC countries. How can our voice continue to be heard when we are competing with young nations hungry for economic growth? How can we set an example to those who do not wish to follow it? With the best will in the world, are many European companies concerned about what method to choose for the transition to the green economy when the imperative issue for them is to fill their order books and to preserve the jobs that are left? It is impossible to negotiate this kind of agreement in an economic context which continues to send us very bad signals. How can we think of the future when the present is uncertain?</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not give up the fight; as the Commissioner rightly said, the clock is ticking. The real issue today is the ability of Europe to lead the way in these climate negotiations because we have the right answers. Unfortunately, these negotiations have brought to the fore the failure of the strategy of the European Union. This summit has demonstrated the paralysis of the process. To obtain unanimity among so many countries is a challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore contemplate reforming the functioning of this system and imagine other avenues of negotiation; urgent action is needed to prevent a tragedy for future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He understands that my main role at the summit was to press the case for mandatory sustainability reporting by business. Again, paragraph 47 of the summit’s conclusions represented only a limited success. I made the case for voluntary calls for business to report. Ten years ago, in paragraph 17 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the European Commission itself did so in 2002, as did the G8 countries in 2007, but since then, we have seen perhaps only 6 000 of the world’s 80 000 multinational companies begin to report. We have to do more, more quickly, and the experience of Denmark, Sweden, South Africa and others is that regulation is an essential part of enabling us to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of paragraph 47 is that it names governments and the UN itself in calling for action on corporate sustainability reporting. It specifically uses the concept of integration and seeks to build on not duplicating existing frameworks. I would specifically name the Global Reporting Initiative and the International Integrated Reporting Council in this respect. I am proud that Denmark and France have joined the Friends of Paragraph 47 as governments in taking this forward. I hope that in his reply, Commissioner Potočnik will express his support for his colleague, Commissioner Barnier, in bringing forward regulation at European level on binding corporate sustainability reporting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many observers, perhaps the majority in fact, said that the money for this major summit could have been saved because the results were already a foregone conclusion and were not very far-reaching.</p>
<p class="contents">To this extent at least, it could be claimed that we did everything by the book. In view of the high costs facing us, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety decided to withdraw its delegation and not to travel. I believe, however, that we cannot just sit back and relax. We need to learn lessons and to make sure that things are handled differently the next time around. First, this means, in practical terms, that we need to investigate how we can participate in events like this without placing an excessive burden on the taxpayer. Secondly, and much more importantly, we need to organise the process more efficiently, so that we do not have another disappointment like this time. Thirdly, we will have to do our homework. It is true that the European Union has already achieved a great deal in terms of sustainable development, which is something we should also be proud of. However, problems also exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the problems in relation to emissions trading. We currently have a much lower price than envisaged in 2008, when we accepted reformed emissions trading. As a result, investors do not have sufficient incentives to invest in low carbon technology. The Member States also have less revenue to pay for the changeover to a green economy, because the income from the emissions trade was to be used for this purpose. We will also have less income to pay for international environmental policies if emissions trading does not work. That is why we need a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament adopted the Davis report with a large majority and, during the negotiations in relation to the Energy Efficiency Directive, we also pressed for a reform in emissions trading. The Commission issued us with a declaration. I would ask the Commissioner to pass this declaration on to all the other commissioners, as it must be upheld. It states that we urgently need a solution – a revised approach to the auctioning of allowances. I hear that the lobbyists are currently working very hard against this, looking for a postponement. Commissioner, I am a doctor by profession, and I can tell you it would be a pretty terrible doctor who first told his patient that he is an emergency case and then blithely took off on holiday. Accordingly, we need to address this problem before the summer recess. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner spoke of progress with regard to women’s rights, but there have been regressions in this area. The replacement of reproductive rights with reproductive health is an unacceptable concession to the Vatican, which has been criticised by various policy makers, including Hillary Clinton and the former Prime Minister of Norway.

We are well aware that we are already living beyond our means. If everyone in the world lived like a Swede, for example, we would consume our planet 3.25 times over. This realisation was clearly not enough, but we must use our resources more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, growth has largely occurred as a result of us having had cheap raw materials and cheap energy, but it will not be possible for that to continue.

<p class="contents">It is possible to do this even now. We know, for example, that it pays to be more energy efficient, and I believe that it is time for us to show that this is possible. It is possible to have a good life and, at the same time, live in a sustainable way. That is how we can encourage others to follow us on the international stage – not with threats or scaremongering, but by showing that it is genuinely possible and does not need to entail massive social problems.

Not being ambitious leads to floods, droughts and fires, as have occurred in Valencia, in Spain.

I ask for accountability given that cutbacks in the public system also lead to fires.</p>
<p class="contents">I denounce my regional government for the lack of coordination in extinguishing the fire, in the evacuation and in the release of information. The citizens of Valencia, Spain, are also EU citizens and I therefore request solidarity aid to alleviate the damage caused by this fire and, above all, to prevent new fires from starting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is whether the summit was a success or a failure. Certainly, it cannot be described as a success, though I am not disappointed personally, because I did not expect and we did not have cause to expect great results under the circumstances. Naturally, we will endeavour to maintain our existing enthusiasm, but the question is for how long we will manage to find suitable partners for it, and whether the policy we have pursued so far is sustainable at all in the long term. As Mr Florenz, the rapporteur, remarked, we are running out of time. We need to perform much more effectively and resolutely on the international stage in order to stand a chance to put into practice the little we have achieved. That primarily requires, however, that the Member States and the political groups reach agreement among themselves. We are aware how greatly our opinions differ on the subject of energy policy, which is closely connected to the fight against climate change. Putting the Energy Efficiency Directive into practice and further development of clean and safe nuclear energy can make a significant, positive contribution to the fight against climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recognise that Europe cannot force its ideas in relation to environmental policy on the rest of the world. This phase of disillusionment can also be seen as an opportunity, however. Europe can act as a role model. That is my first point. My second point is that we need to focus more on adjusting to the new situation brought about by climate change, as well as working towards climate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I believe that Europe’s development organisations, research institutions, universities and private enterprises can make a significant contribution; after all, we need to see economic development and environmental policy as two sides of the same coin. Weaker countries will only be able to pursue environmental policies if they also make progress on the economic development front. So, let us press forward with environmental technology. This is something Europe can offer other countries. Perhaps we need to question the idea of greening. Perhaps we should create blue growth that is mainly based on technology. As the world’s population continues to grow, this will only be possible if we see economics and environmental policy as inextricably linked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally believe it is not to be expected that countries such as China, Brazil, Russia and possibly the US would contribute to our initiative and develop a green policy as intensively as the EU seeks to.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, I believe that we should focus on getting these countries to join in monitoring and tracking meteorological changes in relation, of course, to industrial production and to the ways in which the environment is polluted. Perhaps when they collect data and information more intensively, we will reach a joint conclusion as to the changes and the measures that must be adopted first and foremost so that we can stop climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I believe it is therefore necessary to focus mainly on getting them more closely involved in gathering data, analysing and reviewing the forecasts, and then perhaps they, too, will conclude that certain policy changes need to be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to thank Members for all their interventions. I will not tire you with an assessment of how serious the situation is and so on, because I have said that in this Chamber many times. I also share with many of you the frustration sometimes of not having enough energy and determination to move things forward. To some extent, this reflects the reality not only of the conference which we attended but also of many of the decisions we are taking in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to touch on first, which many of you have commented on, is the process itself. The process did not start in Rio; I could say it did not even finish there. It started a year ago, in New York, negotiations were long and tiring, and there were many sessions, so basically what happened in Rio was the final stage when the host country, Brazil, took the process into its hands. The way they handled it is, of course, their decision and it is true, as some have said, that it was decided before the majority of the Ministers, especially the leaders of the countries, arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not make it true that it was the technical experts who decided. That is not true, because they were the ones who were consulting their capitals at every turn, but it is true that some of the work we had invested in preparing good strong partnerships prior to the meeting could not materialise at the meeting because there was simply no chance for us to meet with many of the delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we played our cards well or not, as you said, Mr Eickhout, is something I shall have to review some time over the summer, but it is true that when we have to be critical of ourselves, we always lose too much time in defining our own positions and do not have enough time to share those positions with our partners. That has been a weak link in the European Union approach at all the conferences which I have attended. I personally believe that what we reached in Rio was as far as one could go and that we have to understand that not everybody thinks the way we do in the European Union, that they have different interests, different views on development.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that when I visited Brazil, for example, a few months before the conference, the discussion I had about the concept of the green economy, which is pretty well understood here, is far from a concept which everybody would stand behind. I think acknowledging that concept in the paper, in as black-and-white a form as it appears today, was quite a major achievement – provided, of course, that the next steps, which should follow, ultimately materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you mentioned that the leaders – or some of them – were not present. Quite a lot actually were present. I would just like to remind you that the presence of leaders does not guarantee success. They were in Copenhagen as you know, while not many of them were in Nagoya or in Durban, where we achieved quite a lot. I think their presence gives an important political message, but, on the other hand, it would not have guaranteed that the document would be more ambitious or would go further than the one which has emerged from the negotiations now.</p>
<p class="contents">It was mentioned by Mr Gerbrandy that the EU was isolated. It is really an interesting thing to look at the international stage and see that we, who are in the deepest crisis economically and financially, are basically the leaders in the field when it comes to sustainability. That is a fact, and I think it is a fact of which we should be proud, but I would say that we were not as isolated as it looks if you only look at the outcome of the document.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many countries with whom we had spoken before and with whom we are still in contact, who pretty much share our views and objectives. I think it would be really important, after Rio, for us to continue working with them, to deepen our relations, to find the friends, the partnerships which are absolutely necessary if we want to push forward some of the agendas to which we have subscribed here in the document agreed in Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing which I find is really a major breakthrough in the philosophy is the concept of green economics. In many of what I would regard as solid analyses after Rio, this is seen as probably the most major breakthrough and way ahead. Green capital accounting, corporate sustainability reporting beyond GDP: if we focus on that and if we get a solid background on which we can build political decisions, then we can really move things forward. You do not take into account what you do not measure is an absolute fact in politics. I think it is important that we start to focus more on the basics of the green economy, on the fact that we should take natural capital into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">So the role of business was honestly quite impressive, as was the role of civil society there. I have never seen such power in one place and, believe me, if they invested the money which they invested to be there, they knew why they were investing it. This is an important message from their side also and we should acknowledge that instead of criticising their presence.</p>
<p class="contents">Working with civil society is, for me, something on which I absolutely have to concentrate in the future. Rio was different from Nagoya, it was different from Durban, it was much broader, and it was different from Rio+20. I would not go as far as saying that Rio+20 was a step backwards. I think that is not a fair assessment. It is a step in the right direction, especially because at Rio 92, the top-down and bottom-up diverged, they went in two different directions. At Rio 2012, actually for the first time, they went together, but we have to work on the top-down, on the political part, where we did not reach as far as we would have wanted to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">On the means of implementation, at all those conferences, as you know – like it or not – there is a bit of a divide between developed countries and developing countries. Often, developing countries expect more of the carrot and more of the direct development aid. I think again that we should be quite proud of what Europe has done there. We have again committed to 0.7%. I would not like to remind you that we are currently on 0.41% of GDP. The figure of 0.7% by 2005 is a serious additional amount of money because 0.41% is approximately EUR 53 billion. I will leave you to do the calculations, but this was the commitment which was made by all European countries, and I think it is important that we keep that commitment alive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, with the means of implementation, we have to be clear that there is no public money which could turn countries, including ourselves, from the current economic model to a green economic model. So you need private financing as well as public financing at home. For example, not supporting the paragraph on removing environmentally harmful subsidies, which we were very much pushing for, and requesting more official development aid, does not really make sense. It is not consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">So, all incentives which you send into the systems need to be consistent. That is why I think we should insist on the broader picture regarding the means of implementation. On UNEP, I can promise you that we will continue working with Africa and ACP countries. Quite a strong power actually emerged and we believe that this is the way in which we should continue. However, in Rio, it was simply impossible to reach that, because there were such clear statements from some strong partners in negotiations that they were not ready to support that in Rio, and that it was impossible to go that far.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what should we do? I think we should simply continue work in the European Union. We should simply try to identify our partners, use all possible institutions, hooks, conventions and continue our work. Basically, without everybody on board, there will be no green economy. The green economy, by definition, is about economic stakeholders and the business sector. Without them on board, we will not change the reality from the top down. We have to work with them and we have to use the positive powers which evolved there.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are basically talking about the very essence of the question of changing the production and consumption models. This is absolutely something where you need bottom-up and top-down approaches and where you need practically everybody on board.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as I have mentioned already to some friends who were in Rio, I came from Rio not with any kind of bad conscience but, yes, with some bad feelings. In order to conquer those feelings, I think the only way is to work hard in the European Union to deliver what we have committed ourselves to many times. To be honest, I have seen recent opinion polls showing where our public is placing its attention. Even pushing the agenda which we are all subscribed to will not be easy, but we should basically sometimes ‘walk the talk’ ourselves. I think that is the most we can do at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, we should share the responsibility with the rest of the world and build trust. I really feel that this is necessary because, at these big conferences, the real question is always the lack of trust. We should work on that. Even if we have the feeling that we are not reaching as far as we should and that the urgency of the situation is much more pressing than anybody thinks, we should continue working with the rest of the world. We should do so because many of those questions simply have no proper answer if we do not get everybody on board.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning, I do not think that the destiny of the success of Rio has yet been defined but, if we create a strong partnership with your help, I think we can make it better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was presumed that the high-level conference would scrutinise the most severe global problems and draw up specific strategies in order to achieve goals not met in the past two decades. However, despite the efforts of many thousands of civil organisations, there is little hope of implementing the outcome document of the summit at the political level. In my view, the outcome document ‘The Future We Want’ merely reaffirmed the earlier agreements, failing to set out new goals and make a commitment to goals. It contains short-term plans at the national level, but fails to take into account the limits of the Earth’s ability to sustain itself. Although the document is a political position statement about sustainability, it is dominated by the paradigm of economic growth. I myself also believe such change needs to be effected at every level with the application of the basic principle of subsidiarity. However, it is crucial for global and international-level decision making to set an example with regard to the necessary changes and to the development of ways to manage the increasing economic, social and environmental challenges appropriately. In that light, the European Parliament, which is endeavouring to restrict the use of resources, urges limitation of the use of all raw material types. I believe that is the only way to reduce the current wasteful consumption in an effective way and limit the unsustainable use of resources and its impact on both the natural environment and human communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU was particularly disappointed that the host country, Brazil, which had taken over the Presidency from the UN, pushed through the outcome document before the ministers had had time to get there, and decided to strip the text of all its controversial elements. As a result of what was a wretched process of facilitation, the EU was unable to form its coalition, and many of its priorities were not recorded or were entirely ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">It is common knowledge what I think about the UN’s climate processes. Rio+20 was not a climate conference, but what they have in common is that the processes in their current form achieve nothing meaningful. The decision makers at Rio should have had an opportunity, for example, to use the nine Major Groups – Business and Industry, Children and Youth, Farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and so on – as a resource for determining the content of the outcome document. The disappointed Major Groups, who were prepared to assist the decision makers, marched out of the meeting and dissociated themselves from the section of the opening address that proclaimed that the outcome document had been finalised through consultation with them. The future that they wanted to see was not achieved, for which we can primarily blame the process and the EU’s intrusive marketing strategy for the green economy. The developing countries began to consider the concept to be a conspiracy theory that obstructed their economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will implement the EU’s priorities within the Union, and not dash the hopes that civil society had for us. Future generations will need jobs, sustainable forms of energy, the chance to consume sustainably and a voice in decision making. Fortunately, the ‘sustainable development goals’ process was initiated and the initiative on water and sanitation as a human right, as promoted by Finland, was mentioned for the first time in a UN document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have my doubts about the functioning of democracy during multilateral negotiations. Associations that promote or that do not exclude abortion as a tool for controlling birth suffered a severe setback through the failure of the demands made throughout the Rio+20 negotiations. It should be noted that the phrase ‘sexual and reproductive health and associated rights’ was, in fact, deleted in the final statement. Yes, there are political issues and human problems that are indeed more urgent than the promotion of abortion around the world. Sustainable development, human progress for all and peace throughout the world will not be achieved without justice for all. Nevertheless, throughout the negotiations, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), Marie Stopes International, the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) and other organisations financed by the EU budget have explicitly established a link between sexual and reproductive health, abortion and sustainable development. Shockingly, these associations would have us believe that the children of the poorest families are children too many for humanity. They did not succeed. I therefore call on the Commission to abide by the outcome of Rio+20 and to stop financing these associations, since their actions no longer enjoy international consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was yet another summit that brought no significant results. In the light of the economic problems and the jobs crisis, it is naïve to think that the leaders of China, India or the USA will agree to the European Union’s eco-friendly ideals. At present, under pressure from ecologists and left-leaning politicians, the EU has set itself ambitious emission reduction targets. However, it is not the European Union – which produces only 11% of the greenhouse gases emitted globally – but the countries cited above that are responsible for most of the world’s industrial emissions as well as for the use of natural resources. It is China and the USA that have become the largest oil importers and the most energy-intensive economies. For a long time now, both countries have been resolutely opposed to any attempts at reducing emissions. As a result, the EU stands alone with its ambitious targets. The unilateral restrictions adopted by the European Union are weighing ever more heavily on Member States. Social costs are rising and the competitiveness of the EU economy and the profitability of manufacturing are falling. For this reason, guided by a concern for the natural environment as well as the future of Europe, we should do everything to encourage the international community to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This time, however, without our participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
