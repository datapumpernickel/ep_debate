<p class="contents">Madam President, Europeans have been seafarers since the earliest decades of history. Not only European integration but the growing together of Europe has its first roots in the sea voyages of antiquity which took merchants and explorers from the east coast of the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and to the British Isles. But globalisation, our globe that is growing ever closer, began with sea travels that made contacts between people on different continents possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The maritime sector has throughout the course of European history played a crucial role in the political, economic, social and scientific development of our nations. Seafaring and ship building remain crucial fields of activity in today's European Union. The merchant shipping sector is, for example, of strategic importance to the economic well-being of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The last two decades have unfortunately seen a sharp decline in the number of EU seafarers. This is caused mainly by two factors. First, EU shipowners have a lower demand for EU seafarers because of financial considerations. Third-country nationals who might not be as highly educated and trained as their EU colleagues are employed instead. Secondly, the supply of well-qualified EU seafarers is declining since fewer and fewer young Europeans choose maritime careers.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the causes that underlie the unwillingness of young Europeans to choose maritime careers can clearly be identified. Community and international law on living and working conditions is inadequately applied on EU merchant vessels. Modern technologies are not used enough to improve living and working conditions on board. National authorities and the social partners will have to step up their efforts and see to it that existing legislation is fully applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime training in the EU needs to be developed further. A high-quality system of maritime education and training is vital to the future of EU seafaring. I encourage, therefore, the building of networks between the academic institutions for seafarers' education and training. Cooperation between training institutions and companies in this sector should be increased. For example, the sharing of facilities and specialisation may allow institutions to purchase capital equipment and to launch courses for the new target groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community offers financial support for training and human resource development, so these should be used to their full extent. I urge Member States and social partners to exploit fully all possibilities of funding, such as the European Social Fund, Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. The existing Community funds should be used to supplement existing funding from national and regional budgets for maritime education and training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication is an excellent resumé of the current situation. We in Parliament thus ask the Commission to enlarge its valuable analyses further. Employment and training of seafarers depends closely on the market conditions of the maritime transport sector. I therefore urge the Commission also to provide an analysis of the underlying economic variables relating to maritime transport, in particular with regard to the competitive position of the EU fleet. The industry, in discussion with MET institutes and the social partners, should intensify its efforts to develop career paths, training and job content that take account of opportunities available in the wider maritime sector, following time employed at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I will summarise by saying that the shortfall of EU seafarers in general, of well-trained personnel, is likely to have negative consequences as far as safe navigation, number of accidents and marine pollution are concerned. These accidents are mostly caused by human error. There is a clear need to safeguard the employment of EU seafarers on board and on shore, to preserve the maritime know-how in the Community, to develop maritime skills and to improve the safety of maritime transport. This requires high-standard training possibilities as well as adequate employment and career prospects. The responsibility for the necessary action is shared between the industry, the social partners and the Member States' authorities. But you clearly know that the Commission has a big role to play in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is with great pleasure that I speak on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who sent me to this beautiful city of Strasbourg to attempt to remind people of their existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kauppi’s document, whose content, proposals and analysis of the difficult situation of seafarers I fully support, takes me back in time to when I was the age Mrs Kauppi is now. I was not a member of a parliament, I sailed in the ships which take American tourists from New York to the Bahamas and vice versa. Being a seafarer myself, I met a number of people who worked on the ships. At that time, seafarers were fortunate individuals with extremely high wages; jobs as crewmembers<span class="bold"> </span>of<span class="bold"> </span>both passenger and cargo ships and even oil tankers were sought after. However, now, 35 years on, I have met friends who used to sail with me again and they tell me that everything is different now, for the ships that sail the seas of Europe are now manned by Indonesian and Colombian seafarers and seafarers from all the world’s poor States, and their wages are a maximum of EUR 100/150 per month, that is less than 10% of the wages of European seafarers. I therefore feel we must work to ensure that, whatever the flag flying on the ships sailing the European seas, the crewmembers have agreements laying down the same wages as those of workers on dry land. Seafarers must not be exploited on European ships just because they come from poor regions of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to begin by congratulating both the Commission and the rapporteur, who highlights some of the aspects of strategic importance to maintaining the high professional standards that it is considered will meet the needs that the Union is going to have if it wishes to maintain, and put into practice, a mechanism on which it legislated recently, intended to ensure maritime safety. This mechanism requires a new professional approach in ports, new competences in the field of inspections and, above all, new requirements for the seafarers working in the Union’s exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that all of these matters fall within the competence of Member States, but we have already seen that, in the field of safety, if there is no strategy there will be no effectiveness. We also know that 80% of accidents are attributed to crewmembers. This is an unacceptable factor, which has its roots in the fact that our ship-owners, and our entire maritime transport system, are dependent on a single factor that is decisive in human activity, for reasons of competitiveness and of the very survival of the industry, but which must be regulated within the Community<span class="italic"> </span>and also in the international institutions, whether it be the IMO or the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, on this matter, the Member States have had no development strategy in place. Employment has fallen in this sector by 40% and salaries have also decreased. This has led to these professions, especially those of experienced officers, who are essential for navigating the specific coastal characteristics of the Union and for meeting the needs that I have mentioned, being taken over by citizens of third countries who do not even share the same language or the same ability to communicate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, Madam President, we repeat that the Commission must regulate and harmonise not only training courses but also pay and living conditions on board and the safety of crewmembers, and it must also act together with other economic blocs that have unilaterally expanded the market, leaving it uncontrolled, or which have established protectionist practices, as the United States has done.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the Commission is genuinely able to ensure – and is on the way to doing so – that the Member States continue to supply high-quality seafarers, in order not only to do justice to our past but also to our future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to admit that representing London I do not have too many fishermen in my constituency and I am delighted to be able to put forward a few comments on behalf of Mrs Scallon who, unfortunately, cannot be here today as she has a pressing engagement. She has followed this dossier very carefully because of the large fishing industry in her constituency in Ireland. I should like to pass on her and my thanks to the Commission for focusing on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">When speaking to stakeholders in this industry, Mrs Scallon found that they were very concerned about the concept of flagging out, which was one of the root causes of the sharp decline in EU seafarers and the increase in the use of third-country ratings and junior officers. EU crew members suffer a severe competitive disadvantage; with their working conditions of working one week on, one week off with full pay on passenger ferries, they find it very difficult to compete with non-EU crew members working nine months on, and one month off without pay. As a result, there are few training places available for EU junior officers and ratings and, sadly, redundancy is being offered to many in this industry in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with many of the points highlighted in the report, Mrs Scallon heard that there was concern regarding the lower standard of EU training and the possible danger to public safety that might be caused by language difficulties with multilingual crews, where no translation was available. Both Mrs Scallon and I would definitely like to see more training places available if we are to stop this decline. Experienced seafarers are also ideal for other temporary, onshore work off-season in areas such as recruitment, training, freight forwarding, insurance and arbitration. As part of the suggested awareness campaign, we should also look at the possibility of funding the promotion of seafaring at secondary-school level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Scallon closed by remarking that it was sad that even in the fishing villages of her own country, seafaring, rowing and sailing were not subjects which played a great part in the curriculum. That is something that we both regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication on the training and recruitment of seafarers, which we are discussing today, is an important document for the Commission, intended to stimulate a debate at European level on the worrying problem of the falling number of Community seafarers. The Commission takes the view that the European Union in general, and its maritime industry in particular, cannot do without well-trained, efficient and motivated seafarers. 90% of the Union’s external trade and more than 35% of its internal trade depend on maritime transport, which means this activity is crucial to the economy of the Union. The communication explains that the Community cannot afford to lose its vital pool of experience unless it wishes to endanger safety and the environment<span class="italic">, </span>as well<span class="italic"> </span>as the competitiveness of maritime transport and of related sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the long term, the predicted dearth of Community seafarers will lead to a shortage of workers in the European Union in land-based activities related to maritime transport. We must conserve the knowledge and the experience gained by Community seafarers during their time at sea if the European Union wishes to avoid damaging the naval industry as a whole. The communication proposes various recommendations. All of the proposals are based on the principle that, whilst it remains relatively unattractive from the social and financial point of view in comparison with land-based work, a seafaring career will not be able to attract high-quality seafarers and, consequently, guarantee operational efficiency, safe seafaring and the proper maintenance of ships or achieve the reduction, which the maritime community needs to see, in the number of accidents and in marine pollution. This is especially true today, since, given the recent terrorist attacks, greater attention still needs to be paid to the human factor in all sectors, including the maritime sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to see that the European Parliament subscribes to this philosophy and supported most of our recommendations, at the same time making its own contribution with proposals that I feel are very constructive. I should, therefore, Madam President, like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, first of all, and then the entire European Parliament too, for the reception our communication has received.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that Parliament is going to adopt today will make a major contribution to stimulating the political debate on this issue. I can only hope that the Member States also agree swiftly to address the matter. The fact is that most of the actions proposed by the Commission, and which I hope Parliament will support, will have to be undertaken by the Member States, the naval institutes, the maritime sector and the social partners, and we hope shortly to see things set in motion. Today, we call on these bodies to act and the Commission wishes to express its thanks in advance. We are willing to continue research in the field of the employment, education and training of seafarers and to undertake a study of the economic variables that underpin maritime transport, as requested in Mrs Kauppi’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
