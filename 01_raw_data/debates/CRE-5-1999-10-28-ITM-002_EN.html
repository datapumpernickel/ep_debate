The question is whether this should be dealt with here, i.e. after a discussion in the Committee on Budgets, or whether it should be discussed as part of an extensive debate about the re-structuring of the Commission as a whole in all the relevant committees. We are concerned that a whole spate of amendments will not actually benefit the management of the Commission. My group will therefore vote against this amendment but many subsequent amendments will also contain this particular issue. I therefore want to point out that, as of today, we will only vote on the additional points in those amendments and that our vote, as far as this aspect is concerned, will remain unchanged throughout the voting procedure, because otherwise, I would have lumbered you with more than twenty split votes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, we held a consultative meeting with the coordinators of the various Groups and a compromise was arrived at between the coordinators regarding the amendments to sub-section B1-4.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise involves a change to the amounts of the amendments adopted by the Commission on Budgets. It makes it possible to cover all the lines in sub-section B1­4. If this amendment were to be voted in, the request for a separate vote introduced by Mr Walter, the coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and others, would then have to be withdrawn. So, if this compromise is adopted, we should still have to vote on the heading for line B1­4050, amendment 507, with a favourable opinion from the Committee on Budgets and in a split vote requested by the Group of the Greens, as well as the heading for line B1­406 on Amendment No 69, this time with a vote by roll call.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the compromise amendment concerns lines B1­400, B1­401, B1­402, B1­4030, B1­404, B1­4050, B1­406, B1­4070, B1­408 and concerns a total amount of EUR 115 million, or, more precisely, it deducts EUR 115 million from the margin.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is the content of the oral amendment. I believe that we must vote on this and then, if it is adopted, obviously the whole section will be finalised in the way I have just described. Thank you. I cannot be associated with it in my official capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets. I shall be voting on this amendment in a personal capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Bourlanges (PPE), </span><span class="italic">general rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the amendments relating to the fifth framework programme for research have had to be changed following a compromise which was reached yesterday with the Commission. This was a compromise which was difficult to reach, and I have to thank Mrs Schreyer for having ensured that it was achieved. This compromise met with the approval not only of the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the committee responsible, with the particular support of Mrs McNally, its rapporteur, whom I must thank for her cooperation. In terms of procedure, this means that amendments 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653 and 654 must be voted on separately. Moreover, one line for administrative expenses has been created for each programme and the amounts for the various key measures will be entered in the remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the compromise arrived at is a very simple one. It was a question of whether to create one line per key measure, as had been envisaged by the Committee on Budgets, or to maintain a single overall line for research, as the executive committee wished, in exchange for guarantees that information would be provided on the transfers of funds between key measures within this line. Since these assurances were given by Mrs Schreyer, we can therefore vote on the compromise according to the procedural conditions which I have just described.</p>

Thus we have an amendment from the Committee on Budgets which, I must say, was voted on in a state of some confusion, and which represents a hybrid entity since it has the European Women's Lobby’s title and the content of Mrs Scallon’s amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, it will not have escaped you that in some respects the positions of the European Women’s Lobby and Mrs Scallon are not identical, but this is the amendment which the Committee on Budgets has voted on. I can understand people voting against it. I am supposed to be supporting it, but I find it somewhat incoherent. If Parliament votes against it, then we will then have to vote for or against the amendment of the European Women’s Lobby. Procedure does not allow for Mrs Scallon’s amendment to be reintroduced into the cycle since there is no compromise basis for an oral amendment to be submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply think that the problems that have arisen on this occasion will certainly be examined by the Committee on Budgets, within the working party specifically set up by chairman Wynn to deal with the subject of this institution’s policy on subsidies as a whole. I wish to reassure my fellow Member on that point, but, in my opinion, we can vote only on the two amendments which have been submitted: the Committee on Budgets’ amendment and the amendment reintroduced by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>

It is a considerable task that we have completed with the help of the rapporteurs, the members of the Committee on Budgets, and all of you, and I am naturally rather excited to receive these votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to thank everyone who voted for this budget, and also those who voted against, thus contributing to democratic expression. Above all, I would like particularly to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Budgets which has carried out a truly considerable task.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">You have to be a rapporteur to know the extent to which the life of all the Members of the Secretariat of the Committee on Budgets is disrupted by the infernal pace of this procedure, and I think this is something we must be aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides that, I should like to say a couple of things, with your permission, to the Council and the Commission. Council Member, Commissioner, I think that you have been able to observe the extent to which Parliament was united, united in fighting not only for its rights but also for a number of fundamental changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The year that we are currently living through has been characterised by two fundamental crises, the international crisis in the Balkans, and the crisis affecting our own institutions with the departure of the Commission. On both these points, ladies and gentlemen, the votes you have expressed show the determination of this Parliament to lead the way and to find the necessary solutions to both these problems. Tomorrow, we shall be open to discussion with the Council and with the Commission, but have no doubts, ladies and gentlemen, about dialogue between institutions, do not harbour any doubts about the determination of this House!</p>

But in the report, as it now stands before us, there are still some points of uncertainty with reference to two matters. Firstly, there is no clear definition of members and elected representatives. This is worth clarifying. Secondly, there is uncertainty and a procedure, which we consider incorrect, stating that, in the event of errors in Parliament, officials should report back to other officials. We, on the other hand, are of the opinion that, if there are irregularities, officials must report back to the President of the Parliament. We must come back to these matters again. We therefore request that the report be referred back to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee could call an extraordinary meeting in the course of the next week and, if necessary, in Brussels on Thursday of next week we could then finally proceed to the vote, making it possible to gain the broad support of the whole House, if the requisite clarifications have been made. But, failing this referral to Committee, today unfortunately we are not in a position to give this report our approval, to our great regret.</p>
<p class="contents">With the intention of achieving a broad consensus on this important question, we therefore demand that the report be referred back to Committee.</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, it is an interinstitutional agreement which was signed by the previous President of this Parliament. The political persuasion of the President does not matter. It was Mr Gil-Robles, the President of our Parliament. And Parliament was in agreement. And we have to honour our own acts.</p>
<p class="contents">I, today, have just found out about two new reasons to re-examine this report and it surprises me, because in fact it deals with something else, of another political approach, and I would welcome its being done clearly. From the point of view, not of my political group, but of the previous Parliament, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which unanimously approved this report, there is really no lack of clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">And, furthermore, with regard to the possible lack of clarity between MEPs and officials, I must say that the Bureau of the Parliament which you, Mr President, form part of, clearly adopted amendment instructions last Monday for this regulation in accordance with their competences.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there is no lack of clarity. Furthermore, we have been subject to a summons by the Council for the last month because we have not honoured our word.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there is no lack of clarity here. Here there is a political will to create a conflict with the Council and not to respect our word. My group therefore radically opposes this proposal.</p>

It is not a matter of obstructing the work of OLAF, or not facilitating it. We all want OLAF to be able to commence its work properly as soon as possible and work effectively for the benefit of the European Union. But this proposal contains considerable legal weaknesses which require further consultation. Articles 2 and 4 of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure contain conditions which are clearly in contradiction of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which concern the status of elected representatives and which also, incidentally, lay down the rules governing the question of immunity aside from what is stated in the relevant regulations of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. I am therefore convinced that this needs revising in the interests of the case, and would therefore like to request that we adopt Mr Poettering’s suggestion.</p>

The request is completely unexpected. In this House, on Monday, we discussed the report I tabled on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted it unanimously. Also, two influential Members, representatives of the Group of the European People’s Party – the ones who spoke on behalf of the Group – spoke clearly in favour of the report on Monday. Now we are told, no less, that there are serious legal gaps. I, naturally, respect the legal background of the Member who spoke, but I am also surprised by the fact that these serious gaps were not regarded as such by the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – who, in terms of legal knowledge, are deemed second to none. What I mean is, the Committee cannot, under any circumstances, go any further than it has done already, as the inclusion of this Interinstitutional Agreement in the Rules of Procedure does require technical adjustments, but these must not call into question the agreement negotiated and signed on behalf of Parliament. </p>

In my opinion Mr Corbett’s point is not acceptable. We are dealing with an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and the seriousness of this vote necessitates the decision that you were just making.

But the addition of an Annex to the Rules of Procedure is quite clearly an amendment to the actual Rules of Procedure and, as such, requires an absolute majority. We can never amend the actual Rules of Procedure by means of an Annex. That is perfectly clear. We have just decided, may I remind you, that the common regulation contained in the interinstitutional agreement, with the necessary measures to facilitate the trouble-free conduct of OLAF inquiries in accordance with the Parliament resolution, which is appended as an Annex to the Rules of Procedure, is applicable within Parliament. This resolution did not achieve the necessary majority. It cannot therefore claim validity on the basis of the Rules of Procedure. I believe we would be well advised to refer this matter back to the competent committee for consultation now and discontinue the debate on the Rules of Procedure here.</p>

Namely, last Thursday, at the President’s meeting, two compromises were made among the leaders of the groups. The first was that to which Mr Poettering referred this morning, which is to say that there is no mention of the name of Michelin in the resolution on the relocation of companies. On this I agree with Mr Barón Crespo in an earlier discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we made another agreement as well. As certain groups feared the delicate nature of this report, we decided that a debate should be organised on it on Monday and a vote on it on Thursday. In this way the groups had a whole week to debate the sensitive points in this proposal. I do not understand why the chairmen of certain groups refer to the agreements in other connections, but in some cases these agreements do not mean anything. I think we should have discussed the matter according to the normal order of events and voted on it today, with no undue incident.</p>

Personally, I believe that we are making a mistake, largely due to the way the original regulations of OLAF were put together, but that is another question. Here we must have a very clear idea about why this Parliament requires an absolute majority for questions which affect MEPs. You have given the reason, Mr President: because we are looking for a broad consensus. We cannot hide behind a technical question that there are agreements which are not incorporated in the regulations. This is a matter which must remain outside the regulations and therefore the logical and reasonable thing – and rules, when the law is the law and not just formal texts, must be reasonable – should be that this be supported by an absolute majority in this Parliament. Any other approach would fundamentally contravene the very essence of the parliamentary Rules of Procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anything which affects Parliament’s right to self-regulation affects a core element which allows it, or rather enables it, to perform its sovereign functions as the people’s representative. This is found in the constitutional history of all parliaments. This is the reason why specific precautions are introduced to prevent this sovereignty being limited in any way. If we take an impulsive, majority decision on a matter of this kind and interpret the annexes without taking into account how these agreements affect fundamental issues, we will in some way contravene the basic rationale, the objective of the legislation we are addressing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither do I dispute the fact that an amendment to the Rules of Procedure is to be approved. But it was clear this week, having discussed this amendment extensively, that leading members from all groups were in favour of amending these Rules of Procedure now. It completely staggers me to think that political rearguard action has led to a situation where the largest group of this Parliament is now prepared to give out negative vibes to the outside world. We warned against this happening only this week. We said: please do not hide behind formal objections. Nobody has been able to prove that the formal objections will remain a reality after this amendment is adopted. Rumour now has it that there is no majority for this amendment itself. Well, I can tell you this much: we are repeating the same mistake we made in May. We gave bad vibes then too, namely that, despite all agreements, there continues to be a majority here in favour of maintaining a privileged situation. As far as I am concerned, these agreements are sacred. I do hope that we can approve this amendment. </p>

Clearly, we need to avoid a repeat of the debate which we had this morning, both as regards the agreement existing between the Groups on whether we should mention the firm we discussed at such length this morning and also as regards the specific question of whether the signatories of a specific compromise text were aware of the fact that a part of the text had been changed. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two proposals. Firstly, I think that the Secretary-General of Parliament should carry out a swift investigation into what actually happened. I think it is right for all of us to be informed for the sake of clarification. Some Members say they signed one text, but other Members say they signed a different one. I think that it is right for us to be informed as to what really happened. The Secretary-General of Parliament will inform us as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the point under discussion is concerned, I have the following proposal to make. If there are no objections, I can also put to the vote the part of an agreed text with regard to which there is a difference of opinion over whether or not it exists in the compromise text. However, I will only put this part to the vote if you all agree because, given that there are two versions, I cannot say that there is agreement. It is, however, possible for everyone to agree that, despite this different interpretation, it is appropriate to vote separately on the part which is controversial. I repeat – I can only go ahead with this vote if everyone agrees. I will obviously not be able to put that part to the vote if any of you is against this working hypothesis. </p>
<p class="contents">To avoid restarting the debate, I would ask the Members who do not agree with the proposal which I have just made to say so immediately, so that we know whether, when we reach that part, we can vote on it or not. If there is an objection, I repeat, we will not be able to put it to the vote. Is there an objection to this proposal or do you all agree that that part of the amendment can be put to the vote anyway? There are no objections? Good. Well, when the time comes, we shall have a separate vote on each part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to draw attention to two specific points, which I think are extremely indicative of the spirit and the methods which predominate within the Union’s institutions. Firstly, the stubbornness with which the European Parliament, despite all the regulations in force, persists in seeking to hand the taxpayers’ money over to so-called European political parties. The Council of Amsterdam which signed and approved the Treaty of the same name had looked into this question and explicitly refused to recognise the existence of European political parties, and still less to finance them from public funds. We must therefore refer back to the current edition of Article 191 of the Treaty, formerly Article 138A, which only mentions, in a rather vague way, the action of political parties, I quote, “at European level”, which is a very different matter, or so the Amsterdam Council and the Treaty intended it at any rate, from the idea of a “European political party” strictly speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in the Parliament budget, under Category 3710, we are surprised to read an entry relating to contributions to European political parties, with an explanation to the effect that the Commission is shortly to present a statute for European political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a brief reference and yet it contains three instances of irregularity. There is no European political party, there is no provision for the allocation of public funds to them, and the Commission has no right to prepare a statute of this type, which is not in accordance with the Treaty. In doing this, the European Parliament is moving its pawns in an illegal manner. Admittedly, for the moment no appropriations have been allocated to this item, but, even so – and this is my second point – it has set aside an enormous appropriation, of EUR 60 million, in a reserve for the Members’ Statute, which is rather mysterious, since the statute does not yet exist and, in any case, even if such a Members’ Statute were to be adopted, it would certainly not apply within the present term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">These two problems, apparently unrelated, lead me to draw a common conclusion. As recently as last year, the Court of Justice of the European Communities severely reprimanded the Commission for making budget expenditure commitments without a legal basis, with the collusion of the European Parliament. I observe that these practices are continuing and even getting worse, since now the European Parliament itself is taking a direct part in it. Thus the old European rule is still being applied here: every base act is permitted as long as it contributes to the construction of a federal Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Council has stated, no precise estimates of the aid requirements have been presented other than those regarding Kosovo.

<p class="contents">The vote on the budget is a key point in the parliamentary calendar. Throughout the process of drawing up the budget, the Group of the Party of European Socialists forcefully defended the principles of Union solidarity and political commitment with regard to the most disadvantaged in order to meet the objective of eradicating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I paid particular attention to the development of Category 4, intended to finance the Union’s external policies and to promote development aid. Indeed, the Community’s historical and political responsibility towards developing countries must be fully taken up by this House and represents one of our absolute priorities. Despite the rationale of the general reduction of appropriations allocated to development aid, the European Community is, and must remain, the main partner of the most disadvantaged countries. In this respect, we cannot accept the Council proposal to implement a 10% reduction in the appropriations allocated for cooperation and development in order to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo and aid to Turkey following the earthquake, or support for East Timor. The cost of these displays of solidarity, all perfectly legitimate, must not be borne by the poorest countries on earth. Indeed, how could we sanction any reduction in the amounts allocated to the prevention of AIDS when it is known that 25 million people on the continent of Africa are already condemned to die from this scourge? Industrialised countries in general and the Member States of the Union in particular must not withdraw from their development aid commitment as that would have social, economic, political and health-related repercussions on the ever fragile equilibrium of the most disadvantaged countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, while being fully aware that the increase in Community spending is occasionally hard for the public finances of Member States to bear, I voted, in spite of everything, in favour of the resolution proposed by the general rapporteur for the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korakas (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">in writing</span>.<span class="bold"> –</span> <span class="italic">(EL)</span> The Commission’s draft and more so the Council’s draft EU budget for 2000 are marked by their austerity and drastic cuts, even in relation to the decisions reached at the European Council meeting in Berlin. </p>
<p class="contents">Budget 2000 is an austerity budget with drastic cuts in agricultural, structural and social expenditure. It is a budget tailor made to the Stability Pact and to the drastic cuts imposed on Member States both within and outside the euro zone. The victims of this policy are the public at large, workers, farmers, artisans, young people and women. </p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural section of the budget, it is evident that even before the start of the multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organisation, the EU wishes to join forces with the Americans and reduce protection and intervention by reducing the funds allocated to individual agricultural products. In turn, this will entail further cuts in producers’ income and further restrictions on farming. What is particularly worrying is the fact that, alongside the reduction in support expenditure for agricultural product markets, there is also an increase in and systemisation of expenditure under the second pillar of the CAP intended to wipe out small and medium-sized farmers. </p>
<p class="contents">We have noted a reduction in the Structural Funds, which proves that the heroic declarations to iron out social and regional inequalities were merely rabble-rousing tactics. The same goes for the exceptionally limited social expenditure which is oriented not towards reducing unemployment or improving workers’ lives, but towards facilitating measures to upset working relations. </p>
<p class="contents">We wish to denounce the efforts to activate the appropriations allocated to Turkey within the framework of the Customs Union and for the promotion of Euro-Turkish relations. We are equally against the tabling of proposals to approve the necessary appropriate legal bases, when it is a well-known fact that the human rights situation in Turkey has showed no signs of improvement, that the same policy is still being pursued on the Kurdish question and that Turkey is still occupying a large part of Cyprus. We also wish to condemn the hypocrisy of the EU on the Kosovo issue. On the one hand, it has totally destroyed the area with its unprovoked and criminal attacks on Yugoslavia and, on the other hand, it is now bending over backwards with its restructuring endeavours, without prejudice of course, while at the same time demanding that the perfectly legitimate government and the President of the country be overthrown.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the report’s containing certain positive individual amendments, it embraces the restrictive and unacceptable agreements reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">It would be naïve of us to expect a different approach from the bodies of the EU, when both the community budget and national budgets have to operate within the unpopular and austere framework of the Maastricht criteria with tight cutbacks in public finances. It would be naïve to expect a different approach when the external policy of the EU is marked by crass hypocrisy, oppressive controls and the ever-increasing subjugation of countries, not to mention open and multiple intervention in their own internal affairs, as is the case with the enlargement process and the Stability Pact for south-eastern Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we shall once again be voting against the draft budget.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleagues who belong to this committee drafted an amendment in order to broaden funding for women’s groups to a wider range of women’s groups. Parliament today has debated this issue and the vote continues this monopolistic arrangement. The issue will certainly continue to be debated over the next year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of principle that all women, and the groups that are campaigning for them, should have equal access to EU funding, most of all when its aim is to allow European organisations to be represented at UN level.</p>
<p class="contents">People are well aware that sometimes it is necessary to take a stand on the principle of transparency and fairness in our democratic structures. Monopolistic arrangements cannot be allowed to continue. While I acknowledge that a monopolistic arrangement has been allowed to continue, I welcome the continuing allowance of EUR 600 000 and would welcome future increases, hoping, of course, that it will assist in making all women’s voices heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have done so firstly for basic reasons of coherence because, when the text of the Annex was signed by me in the name of this Parliament, I did so in accordance with the mandate of the competent bodies of this Parliament. Today’s vote seems serious to me because it entails the discrediting, not of me personally, which would not matter, but of the bodies of Parliament itself during the last legislature.</p>

I have to say that a section of the EPP Group were playing games on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a valid need to draw a distinction between staff matters, which are a Bureau responsibility, and Members’ matters which are a plenary responsibility. That would have been dealt with by Amendment No 2 had we reached that amendment. I was disappointed because the Christian Democrats, as well as the Socialists, had put their names to Amendment No 2 and so it would have been carried and the matter would have been covered. As Mr Gil-Robles has said, and as I said earlier, we are now in a position where the interinstitutional agreement as regards OLAF applies to the Commission, to the Council and to the staff of this institution but it does not apply to the Members of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are the institution that, quite rightly, has made great play of tackling fraud in European Community institutions, how are the citizens of Europe going to understand that the only people with whom OLAF has not reached an agreement in terms of internal investigations are Members of the European Parliament?

I have the impression that my own has been lost en route, and I would also like to give an explanation. Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the question before us is not whether or not the expenses of Members of Parliament must be strictly controlled. I am the first to say, and I explained this at length in my speech last Monday, that there must absolutely be supervision, but that this must be specific supervision, in line with our role as elected representatives, Members of Parliament. In this respect I have just heard many rough approximations, in my opinion. The institutional agreement explicitly mentions the members of institutions, true, but if you take this expression in context you see that it is more a matter of paid members, such as the members of the Commission, and that the terms established are not appropriate for elected members like those of the European Parliament. The two categories of member must not be muddled. In the Napolitano report there is, indeed, another strange confusion resulting from this, between the situation of Members of Parliament and that of officials. Quite clearly, as far as officials are concerned, the decision could have been taken long ago. Besides, Mr President, the Annex was, in my opinion, related to the main body of the text and, consequently, it was not possible, as you quite rightly decided, to vote on the Annex after rejecting the main body of the text. Referral to committee is therefore perfectly justifiable. The Napolitano report had been discussed too quickly, in haste, and many things had been overlooked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It enshrines a new mode of operation for Community institutions based on the maximum possible transparency. It is also a guarantee made to the citizens of Europe of our wish to learn the lessons from the crises which shook the European Commission at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the resignation of the European Commission, the three institutions, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council signed an interinstitutional agreement intended to specify the procedures for the implementation of the administrative inquiries of the European anti-fraud unit (OLAF).</p>
<p class="contents">These new details must be integrated into our internal Rules of Procedure. It goes without saying that we can do nothing but rejoice at the introduction of greater transparency within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision establishes an obligation to pass on information upon any EP official or agent who “becomes aware of evidence which gives rise to a presumption of the existence of possible cases of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity detrimental to the interests of the Communities.”</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">For their part, any Members of Parliament who learn of similar situations must inform the EP President of these or, if they think it useful, must inform OLAF directly. This means a firm commitment to no longer “tolerating” practices which people knew were irregular but which had become customary.</p>
<p class="contents">I will add one qualification, however. This obligation must respect the confidentiality criteria specified either in the legislative texts or in the EP Rules of Procedure (particularly facts which members of parliamentary inquiry committees become aware of).</p>
<p class="contents">I am, furthermore, very pleased to see that it has been decided to add a clause stipulating the protection of officials who observe the requirement to pass on information: they must not in any case be subjected to unfair treatment or discrimination. Just remember how the official who uncovered the scandal was treated!</p>

<p class="contents">Indeed, the European Union has a central role to play in the development of culture and the arts in Europe. In the vision of a Europe of the nations, which is the one I am arguing in favour of here, this is precisely the type of action in which European cooperation can contribute a significant added value.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must stress that we are not to be fooled, for all that. The fact that Parliament wishes to substitute the term “cultural policy” for the term “cultural cooperation” shows the temptation to standardise of a “European” cultural policy intended to replace those of Member States would have. </p>
<p class="contents">Culture must not be the test-bed used by ideologists for the creation of the “European nation”. There is no European culture, any more than there is a European nation. There are, and this is a formidable source of cultural wealth, many nations which participate in the European Union, and many national cultures. This programme will, I hope, contribute towards permitting all citizens of Member States to discover this wealth and this diversity. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group will always support programmes intended to promote exchanges, to develop the appetite for culture in the citizens of our Member States. As long as this really means exchanges and discovery and not creating the Homo Europeus who knows the speeches of Jean Monnet off by heart.</p>
<p class="contents">This new expression of European cultural cooperation is of very special importance on the eve of the Seattle negotiations which will not, I fear, do anything to challenge American cultural hegemony.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am warning the Commission and Parliament against the temptation to use these programmes as an instrument for propaganda or standardisation. There is too much at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, and in conclusion, it seems to me that the war of figures which Parliament, the Council and the Commission are waging regarding this case is particularly fruitless. We all know that the European Union must face up to decisions, painful decisions perhaps, but crucial decisions, in order to ensure its enlargement. So, please, ladies and gentlemen, let us learn to face up to our responsibilities, and let us not accuse the Council of stinginess, when it is simply facing up to the responsibilities which voters and tax payers in our Member States have entrusted to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed I believe that, even though it would be inappropriate to challenge the idea of international free trade, it should however now be forced to take account of a number of unquantified costs imposed on society in Europe. We must somehow continue to reap the advantages of free trade while neutralising its disadvantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the unquantified costs are the social costs resulting from firms relocating. Of course, the redistribution of the workforce internationally may contribute to the better use of the workforce, and thus ultimately benefit everyone. But, at the same time, competition in terms of wages marginalises the least qualified personnel in developed societies, and this is something we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Michelin, who have just implemented some controversial redundancies in France, are in precisely this type of situation, since its main competitor produces tyres in Eastern European countries where wage costs are five times less. The French Minister for Social Affairs, Mrs Aubry, put forward the idea of charging Michelin an exceptional unemployment contribution. This proposal seems absurd, since, in the event, this firm is, if anything, the victim.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, I would propose the exact opposite. Firms who have their manufacturing operations in low-wage countries should be forced to pay an exceptional unemployment contribution when they import goods into France, or into Europe. This contribution would be one element, but no doubt not the only one, in a system for balancing out social costs so as to better regulate international trade between heterogeneous areas, without however depriving us of the advantages of free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that this proposal is one that should be put on the table at the forthcoming trade talks of the Millennium Round which is about to begin in Seattle. I would furthermore like to take this opportunity to recall the main objectives of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group at the beginning of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">1) We would like the importance of the problems which were not resolved by the Uruguay Round to be stressed, problems whose harmful effects we are only just starting to perceive, in the fields of social costs, as I have just mentioned, but also those of the environment, public health, food, etc. It should be remembered, even so, that, alone against the world, or almost, we refused to approve the Uruguay Round, both in the French National Assembly and in the European Parliament, for precisely this reason, i.e. we thought it extremely dangerous to agree to significant reductions in customs tariffs without first resolving the essential collateral problems. And so now we have to try to make up for lost time by entering these matters of social, environmental and health costs on the agenda for Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">2) We want an objective and complete assessment of the Uruguay Round to be drawn up, based on the transparent consultation of governments and specialist non-governmental organisations. We refuse to negotiate in the dark, as at present. It is inappropriate for negotiations to begin in such conditions, and a period of moratorium must be decided while waiting for the assessment to be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">3) We object all the more to a number of matters which the European Union presently proposes to add to the Seattle agenda, subjects whose consequences we shall absolutely not be able to control. I shall cite in particular the question of international investments, which would lead to a second attempt to establish the ghastly Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). I shall also cite the definition of a world competition policy which, as presented today, even more surely than current European policy would lead to public services being compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">4) Finally, we demand that future negotiations openly acknowledge one fundamental principle from the outset, the principle that each nation has the right to choose its own laws, and international trade must respect them. As a logical consequence of this, every nation has the right to express choices and preferences. Areas of preference, be they regionally-based (European Community) or functionally-based (the Lomé Convention), must immediately be recognised as legitimate if they are founded on the democratic decisions of the peoples concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately for the European Parliament, which should have strongly denounced the attitude of the Michelin management which has just announced a massive series of cuts in workforce and redundancies, even though the returns and profits for this firm increased substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">The simultaneous nature of the announcements, of course, blatantly exposed the scandalous and unfair aspect of current economic reasoning and this financial capitalism which has gained the upper hand in Europe and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in the first place, the European Parliament must, in this specific instance, strongly condemn the Michelin management, and request that the firm reconsiders these job losses, and assure the group’s employees of its solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">But this House must also learn the lessons necessary to improve Community legislation, in order to provide some protection for employees against such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the directive on collective redundancy procedure must be reviewed and measures which afford greater protection for workers and for jobs must be included in it. In particular, it is necessary for employees to be able to challenge the actual basis for these redundancies and the economic motives for these before they are actually implemented, and this at a very early stage of the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the establishment of real group level works councils, European Committees with real powers, becomes ever more essential. Once more, the European Parliament should review its directive on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution is singularly lacking in determination and it is to be feared that, unless widespread forces are mobilised, Social Europe will go unheeded on a long-term basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Goodyear, Renault and now Michelin, having adapted themselves to the growth models created by the single market and integrated into the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties and EMU, have turned the climate of unaccountability to their advantage by gradually annihilating every form of social responsibility and protection of workers. This has created more unemployment and increased levels of social exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">Extensive restructuring and company mergers have favoured increased profit-yielding activities at the cost of productive investments which, in turn, has led to mass redundancies. Pretexts are hardly even needed now in the climate of rampant competition and unaccountability of big business<span class="bold">,</span> as is apparent from the announcements by the Michelin management of a 17% increase in profits and 7,500 redundancies, adding to the 15,000 redundancies in recent years. This callousness and cynicism are not only endorsed by the EU and its various bodies; they are also being funded in the context of direct or indirect financial aid intended to safeguard competitiveness on a global scale. </p>
<p class="contents">The human factor has been largely overridden by the most barbaric form of capitalism. Employees are expected, with a gun threatening unemployment held to their heads, to underwrite increased profits and to accept humiliating agreements on terms, conditions and salaries, as in the Michelin case, only to find that their jobs are eventually axed anyway. </p>
<p class="contents">EMU is a one-way street for monopolies whose only aim is to increase profits and consolidate their power. Employees have nothing to gain by following this route which only leads to unemployment, a lower quality of life, marginalisation and eventual destitution. Since employee protection is being violated and disregarded altogether and since employees’ rights are being flagrantly trampled underfoot, the only way open to employees is to protest, fight, challenge the choices made by the monopolies and EMU and fight for full employment, improved living conditions, real social development and prosperity. </p>
<p class="contents">Today’s resolution, in effect, renders the European Parliament jointly responsible for implementing more unpopular policies to the detriment of workers. It is an unacceptable resolution and, on behalf of all working people, we shall be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the recent Senate decision to restart the famous “Star Wars” by voting for further funding, in contravention of the ABM Agreement, its refusal to ratify the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons demonstrates out and out contempt towards worldwide demands for a general and comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing. </p>
<p class="contents">At present, popular movements are fighting for the total abolition of nuclear weapons and, with the threat looming of a resurgence of nuclear rivalry, the general public is calling for a reduction in military defence expenditure to avert the danger of a nuclear disaster. Nevertheless, the USA is not only adopting an extremely defiant stance by blocking efforts to stabilise international relations but it is deliberately undermining endeavours to build a climate of international peace and security. </p>
<p class="contents">This move has evoked considerable concern over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the extensive armament of certain regions of the world and the modernisation of weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p class="contents">Recent revelations concerning the proliferation of nuclear weapons and warheads to third countries which are not nuclear powers, and unbeknownst to their citizens, have added a new terrorist dimension to the threat of a nuclear disaster. Unfortunately, some EU Member States, Greece for example, are included in those countries. </p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that the aspirations of the peace movement are respected all over the world, we are calling for immediate and specific initiatives to be introduced to abolish all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. We are also calling for a general and definitive end to nuclear tests, a ban on the deployment of nuclear weapons outside the boundaries of the countries that own them, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the withdrawal of all atomic weapons which are either deployed or stored in other countries and a ban on the export of all nuclear waste.</p>
<p class="contents">If the funds for nuclear testing and armament were released and channelled towards more productive investments in economic and social cohesion, education, culture and the protection of the environment, then this could ensure conciliation and peaceful co-existence and enhance mutual relations and equal cooperation. This and only this can encourage, strengthen and guarantee stability and peace. The rest would simply overfeed the greedy interests of monopolies and imperialism, particularly American imperialism which is a constant threat to all the people on earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
