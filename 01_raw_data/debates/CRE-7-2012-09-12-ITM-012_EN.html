Unfortunately my concerns have now increased in other areas. This is important because there is a single-market cost benefit in making the European Central Bank the euro zone supervisor. I am concerned that this benefit is now more marginal. We will, of course, aim to rebalance that.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the Treaty provisions – which I must say now look extremely deficient in the area of financial services – I supported the ECB as euro zone supervisor in the interests of credibility. However, we should not pretend that this is a mutualisation that gives over the pockets of the ECB to backing euro zone banks. The only back-up is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is in fact dubious and indirect now. After that, in terms of accountability, it is the pockets of the Member States that are relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposals themselves, Parliament must be fully involved in both pieces of legislation. There are ways that this can be done, and the moral pressure is enormous. We are turning the ECB into the banking supervisor at a time of crisis and a time when the ECB itself has moved centre stage in both economic and political events. Furthermore, given that the transfer of power to the ECB is not comfortable for many Member States – indeed maybe not for the majority of them – nor easy to balance in terms of single market procedures and accountability, it is all the more important that this directly elected House be seen to play a strong role beyond that of merely giving an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that you, Commissioner, and President Barroso have both spoken of this being treated as a package.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to accountability, Parliament’s role must stretch beyond occasional hearings in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I have conspicuously defended the independence of the ECB in monetary policy, but this must not inhibit due process on the supervisory side. We do not expect regulatory failure but, in such an event, an inquiry has to be possible. Without such inquiries we would not have found out about many aspects of the financial crisis and what went wrong. Waiving independence in this respect would help to demonstrate the separation of the supervisory side of the ECB from the monetary policy side.</p>
<p class="contents">On disciplinary matters, the procedure should, as far as possible, mirror the norms of national procedures. The ECB will, in effect, be prosecutor and judge, with the possibility of review by the European Court of Justice. If a banking licence is at stake then this review procedure is not fast enough. When it comes to procedures for hearings, the ECON Committee has more than once indicated dissatisfaction with the DG COMP hearing process and the lack of clarity in charges and evidence. I do not wish to see that as the model to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">More work needs to be done to protect the single market. A duty of care must be required from the ECB in relation to the single market, in the same way that it is required of the Commission. The interaction of the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA) needs adjustment to make sure that it is fair to all parties, and I know how difficult that will be. The ECB must adopt an outward-looking approach: for example, supervising all banks, including branches of third-country megabanks. That is a role for an international supervisor. There is, of course, also an issue of ensuring gender balance on the supervisory board. Having the Chair and Vice-Chair selected from the ECB’s men-only pool is not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, supervisory policy is a matter for the single market and the EBA, not just the ECB. A single rulebook is no longer sufficient: we must have a single supervisory handbook, compiled using the expertise of supervisors from across the Union under the auspices of the EBA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These, honourable Members, are challenges that you know well as you have been taking action and talking about them for a long time now.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the link between the situation of the banking sector and sovereign debt, a link that we want to break. The second concerns the temptation banks have to turn in on themselves, when in difficulties, and retreat to their national domain. It is therefore high time that we took action, and that is what we are doing today with these two legislative proposals, which are complementary and which should allow for the introduction of a single, efficient supervisory mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission presents a proposal for a regulation based on Article 127(6) of the Treaty to entrust the European Central Bank with specific missions in the area of prudential supervision. This is a simple system, it is credible and we believe that it is robust. It will enable the European Stability Mechanism to play its role if necessary, in accordance with the rules laid down in its decision-making procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a credible system because the European Central Bank will, ultimately, be responsible for taking key supervisory decisions, namely those which have an impact on or consequences for financial stability. Other supervisory decisions, for example, and your Assembly pays very close attention to these in the case of consumer protection, will remain clearly within the sphere of competence of national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">The single supervisor will thus be able to grant and withdraw licences from banks, check the risk management of a bank or even require it, within the framework of a European prudential regulation, to increase its funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is as simple as it is because we plan to make the European Central Bank responsible for the supervision of all the credit institutions in the euro area. These, ladies and gentlemen, are, quite simply, the lessons that we have drawn from the crisis. Systemic crises can be caused, as we have seen, by difficulties in medium-sized banks, sometimes even small banks, and not only by major international groups.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is also robust because, quite clearly, it is not a question of asking the European Central Bank to do everything by itself. We want to retain a role and responsibility within the joint supervisory framework for national supervisors who, as we are well aware, have resources, expertise and experience in each country. This single supervision will need these to plan its decisions, carry them out and implement and apply what I shall call the manual for single supervision for each of the banks, but do it at national level, once again, relying on a national supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this system will be open, so to speak. We are proposing to those Member States that are not, or not yet, in the euro area to join the single supervisory mechanism voluntarily.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that some of you are concerned about the legal basis that we have chosen. These people rightly point out that this basis does not provide for a co-decision procedure, but rather the unanimity of the Council, even though Parliament played a crucial role, which I do not forget, in the introduction of supervisory authorities for markets, banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to be perfectly frank as I have always been with you, the choice that we made is the result of several objective considerations. Article 127(6) of the Treaty has the precise objective of entrusting supervisory tasks to the European Central Bank. That was therefore a logical and solid basis, and that is why the Heads of State or Government of the euro area explicitly requested the Commission to work on this basis in their declaration of 29 June. However, Parliament, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, will have its role to play. That I know and that is what I wish. I shall pay attention to any comments, proposals or criticisms that you make, because the two proposals that we are making today, for the regulation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and for supervision, go together, as President Barroso said this morning to you and in your name.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the texts that we propose introduce a genuine system of accountability of the new and future supervisory Council vis-à-vis Parliament, which I think is a big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the second regulation that I have just mentioned will be targeted at adapting the functioning of the EBA to take account of the new balance arising from the single supervisory mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is based on Article 114 of the Treaty, which provides for the ordinary legislative procedure. This proposal amends certain voting procedures within the EBA to enable to it continue to play a full role in developing common standards for the single market as a whole. This amendment is also targeted at enabling decisions to be taken and guaranteeing the single market as a whole, while protecting the rights and interests of each of its members.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are putting forward a document which provides the background to this single supervision project. We cannot put together integrated, efficient supervision without solid foundations, and these foundations, these bases for the 27 countries of the European Union – and that is why I do not want us to confuse the scope of the regulation, which is the same as that of all the other texts we have been putting together for the last two and a half years and that of the supervision – are the legislative proposals already on the table, and partly also adopted, and in some cases already implemented, concerning the future resolution of banking crises, the deposit guarantee system and the requirement for own resources through Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV).</p>
<p class="contents">These initiatives are key elements in what we together have called the ‘single rulebook’, for the internal market, which should indeed apply to all 27 Member States. The Commission does not therefore intend to withdraw either of these two proposals, which not only are compatible with banking union, but are also essential to its development and essential if we want to protect and consolidate the single rulebook, this common regulation for the European banking union as a whole. That is why I want Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and this is something we will discuss with the ministers tomorrow in Cyprus, to come to an agreement as soon as possible on these texts.</p>
<p class="contents">This clearly shows that strengthening the single market and single supervision are two complementary processes. Naturally, the introduction of this banking union will take us further on the way towards strengthening our dispute resolution and guarantee mechanisms, in accordance with the guidelines that have been clearly laid out in the report by the four Presidents and in the European Commission’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are all well aware that there is an urgent need to pull the euro area out of the crisis that it is in, and for the European Union, with its single market, to recover the growth that its citizens expect.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to draw attention to this urgent need, and that is why the Commission, since 29 June, has worked tirelessly, seriously and yet fast, to be able to put on the table in front of you and the governments these two proposals, which go together, to create an open, robust and credible supervisory system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rest assured, however, that I will examine your reply carefully, as I have someone here to listen to you.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, I welcome the proposal. The proposal’s only flaw is that it is late and I therefore wish you the best of luck in developing it. However, the devil is in the detail and, as you know, in 2010 this Parliament requested many of these initiatives, but none of them has been adopted thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to meet two objectives. The first is to guarantee citizens’ deposits. The second objective is that, in the event of a bank failure, we end what has been happening to date, in that citizens have paid for this failure. This, however, is the vaguest area of the proposal tabled here. How should the orderly resolution of a failed bank be organised? What is the timetable for establishing the new authority that will manage this process? How will the prudential powers of the European Central Bank (ECB) then be transferred to the new entity?</p>
<p class="contents">This aspect of managing a bank failure without charging citizens is a key factor in the viability of this proposal. Finally, how do you ensure that the European Central Bank has some appeal mechanism, so that citizens or national supervisors may appeal against decisions by the European Central Bank, which currently has absolutely intrusive and greater powers, and will this probably have to be the way forward?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I end Mr President by asking how you ensure that there is no imbalance in the application of the relevant regulations between the practical supervision of the ECB and other countries and countries that are outside the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, in any event, aware of the fact that this is a complex subject, which should not be over-simplified and which should be examined in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see that you need to manage two contradictory aims. On the one hand, you have the unity of the internal market about which we care a great deal and on which, as you said, we worked two years ago. We have the right of oversight over an institution to which we have contributed. On the other hand, there is the perfectly legitimate right of the euro area to enhance its credibility in the sovereign debt crisis. I believe you also have tried to strike a balance. In the forthcoming discussions, we will see if it is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out two things. You have been brave enough to decide to place all banks under the responsibility of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is, I believe, the right approach in terms of competition. Furthermore, it allows you to make the point to the outside world that the supervision of the banks in the euro area is a European affair, and that is obviously an important point to make. It is also very important to emphasise that we are opening up to countries which are not yet members of the euro area, and to which, I believe, we should appear to be welcoming. Therefore, we shall of course deal with these issues as coherently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a small concern about the change to which this might give rise for the Central Bank. I am not saying that it should not be done. I believe that we must look at things carefully. The strength of the ECB today is its independence, the narrowness of its mandate and its federal structure. What we want is an institution which is more accountable to the elected representatives, with a much wider mandate and one that is part of a network. We must ensure that we retain all the qualities of the Central Bank, when we give it another function.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point, you will doubtless remember that, when we proposed a much more integrated supervision, we were very aware of those companies which act as a bank and an insurance company at the same time. We proposed bringing together the banking and insurance authorities in Frankfurt. Keep that in mind. The closer people are to each other and the more we work together, the better it will be for companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be very important to my colleague that work should progress quickly and reliably on this file in the coming weeks and months. All eyes are on us and the Council in this regard, waiting for us to overcome the crisis with the banks in Europe with a further step towards Europeanisation, namely a European banking union. It should be pointed out that Parliament demanded this with a broad majority two years ago. We held 26 trialogues. We made some progress in this direction, but unfortunately we did not get as far as we really needed to. This resulted in several billions more being added to the bill. It is good that the Council has now seen the writing on the wall and wishes to take things one step further for the good of the euro area. It is praiseworthy that the Commission has drawn up the proposals so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some difficulties with the Council’s proposal that the European Central Bank (ECB) should become the euro area watchdog, however. This results in unanimity in the Council, and means that Parliament is no longer involved in this matter in the codecision procedure. In the light of our experience with the supervisory package, this is not acceptable. That is why it is important that we should work quickly and that we should also negotiate this proposal regarding changes in the ECB as a package with the necessary changes in the existing supervisory regime, thereby securing the principle of the democratic involvement of Parliament on a de facto basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Other challenges also exist on a democratic level. The ECB is independent in terms of monetary policy, but not in terms of fiscal policy, for which it has had no responsibility until now. If it is now made responsible for bank supervision, Parliament needs full budgetary rights, control rights, questioning rights and appointment rights, and I am certain that Parliament will support this with a broad majority. We shall have to discuss the complex additional questions relating to the internal market, consumer protection and the balance between European power and financial responsibility in detail in the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, just like Mr Gauzès, I think the proposal we are talking about today first and foremost deserves a more general debate. It is also necessary to view the debate in the context of what we heard today from Mr Barroso, who told us that banking union is only part of the plan for deeper currency union, for the completion of fiscal union and for the completion of political union. These cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply do not agree that banking union is the miracle solution to all current economic problems. We believe that individual Member States must make serious structural reforms, and we see instead in the banking union proposal a postponement of these reforms, we see instead something that helps states to leapfrog them, something that transfers all debts to the supranational level and something that for a time, shall we say, should address at a supranational level the serious, profound and age-old problems which this proposal addresses only in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am saying this, and if what Mr Barroso said today holds true, then we must say that such a process has to be legitimised in a fundamentally democratic way. It cannot take place - and I apologise to the chamber - but it cannot take place only in these half-empty rows of seats. It must be the subject of serious and profound debate in the individual national parliaments. Citizens must be seriously informed about what is being planned, about what the consequences are for their states and for their pockets, what the benefits are and what the costs are. In my opinion, this is not possible without a fundamental and serious debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I also have another concern, which is an underlying concern: the EU controls monetary policy instruments, monetary policy is the EU’s responsibility, and banking supervision also becomes the EU’s responsibility. However, if everything goes wrong, if the banks fail, the responsibility for paying for this failure falls to the taxpayers of the Member States and it remains a national responsibility. This is not a minor problem; it is a fundamental problem that is not resolved. Finally, I would also like to mention another unresolved problem: the fact that we continue to tie monetary policy to inflation, which is a secondary issue in the current climate, and not to job creation and growth, as it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now faced with Article 12 of the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) without a ratification process, in other words, broken taboos are now to be followed by broken laws. We have heard that it is not only the ESM members, in other words the countries themselves, that are to receive financing, but also the banks directly. By breaking this taboo we have a situation whereby funds are to be paid out via the ESM and the supervision of the banks is to be handled by the bank that is increasingly becoming a bad bank because it is to buy up all the scrap loans of the bankrupt states of Europe. This system is doomed to failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the previous proposals in relation to bank supervision are in no way suitable for controlling the financial markets. If we really want to control the financial markets, this bank supervision by the ECB is wholly inadequate. The supervision of the financial markets that would be needed in order to take control in this area has failed mainly due to the resistance of the United Kingdom, which is unwilling to place its own financial economy under the control of the European Union. Thus, we find ourselves in an absolute dilemma. Nothing that is being done is sufficient. In the final analysis it will cost the taxpayer billions, taking us one step closer towards a union of the permanent debtors of the rest of Europe, a new USSR in other words. The countries with a healthy balance sheet are constantly required to pay for those countries that previously received low interest rates, despite the fact that they did not have the balance sheets to warrant these. This is a complete dead-end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a good thing because it is now clear that, following in the Council’s footsteps, the Commission has now reached the same conclusions as Parliament in 2010, namely that we need a banking union. Secondly, this is positive because the creation of a European surveillance mechanism offers the prospect of breaking the vicious circle between the banking problems and those of national debt, and thus the taxpayers. The third reason why this is to be welcomed is because concrete policy processes have now been put into motion. It is only with solid and conclusive decisions and with serious concrete steps forward that we will be able to regain the confidence of the people and the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now discuss this in detail. This is a proposal that demands a lot of attention because it is a very radical proposal. Later, we will definitely have the opportunity to return to this issue. But what I would now like to add is: in Parliament we have been concerned on at least one occasion about the democratic dimensions of this issue and– as you have already indicated – about its legal basis and the consequences of that basis on the involvement that Parliament can have in this important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we will not be choosing a different legal basis: we would need at least another six months, and that is a considerable loss of time, time that we cannot afford to lose. So, I am pleased that you have announced – as Mr Barroso said this morning – that we should debate these two proposals together. We trust that that will take place and that there is an agreement with the Council on that. It is the best guarantee of achieving high-quality surveillance, the kind of surveillance that is necessary to ensure that the banks again play the role that they have to play, and that is being at the service of the real economy and ensuring growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to working constructively with everyone involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA).</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I really cannot see how we could have gone any further than what you are proposing. I think you have scored 20 out of 20 here. You are trying to supervise all the banks in Europe, and not only some of them. You are aiming for simplicity and I think that we can only welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">Where you have perhaps shown a little less ambition, is when you said, ‘We accepted the legal basis that the Council recommended to us.’ I would nonetheless like to remind you that it is you, and you alone, who have the right of initiative, and therefore you were perfectly at liberty to choose another procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, obviously I understand the choice of the European Central Bank, but I think that it causes us two problems. It causes us the problem of the concentration of power. I do not think that it is healthy, in a democratic system, for one institution in particular to accumulate too much power. However, here, in the context of crisis management and monetary policy, we are witnessing a kind of mission creep at the Central Bank, a change in its mandate, the temptation, in brief, to extend its powers, and here, we are going to increase them even further. I think that we should pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: we are dealing with an institution whose traditions do not include democratic accountability, in other words one in which independence is a deeply rooted family tradition. I find it hard to see how those very people who pride themselves on their total independence when they come before us as a monetary authority can then show the requisite deference to the democratic institutions when they act as supervisors. I think that we would need a great deal of imagination to introduce provisions and rules to ensure that there are no abuses of power or lack of democratic accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is clear that, by subjecting all European banks to European supervision, you are breaking not only the unhealthy link between public debt and private debts, but you are also perhaps breaking another link, that is the rather excessive complicity between the supervised and the supervisors at national level. That incestuous behaviour should cease and you will contribute to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How are the non-euro zone Member States’ banks going to interact within euro zone countries? How will cross-border and third country relationships in the financial services be treated? How will the single market and the single rule book for the 27 be preserved and how is the EBA (the European Banking Authority) going to function with 17 Members represented by a single body balanced against the other ten? Solving the constitutional quandary will not be easy, and in doing so I hope that the Commissioner will be able to answer all of these questions to the satisfaction of this House and all 27 governments. The EU Treaty article being used might seem convenient to redistribute the powers of supervision, but the barrier of unanimity is going to be a difficult safeguard to overcome.</p>

I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And that is the very thing that is crucial for growth and jobs. I wish to compliment Commissioner Barnier on the proposals he has tabled today. The direction he has taken is good because it means giving intervention powers to the ECB. However, we have to see how well this will be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to focus on certain considerations. We must not distort the internal market, but strengthen it. That means a strong role for the EBA as guardian of the simple European ‘rulebook’. But, how will this work in the future? Will it be revoked by the ECB with additional capital or liquidity requirements? What is the connection between the two? In addition, we need to expand banking supervision as soon as possible to as many banks as possible in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies my second point of concern. Because, despite what you said, a wall is likely to be erected between banks in the countries within the euro area and those outside it. There, too, there are banks that have been infected by the crisis virus and there, too, there are many countries, such as Poland, Hungary and others that would like to join. We need to deal with that seriously because, ultimately, we want stability throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries have already tried to take the edge off the proposals. But, we need to <span class="italic">strengthen</span> those proposals and, to do that, we need Parliament! This was the case when it came to the establishment of the European supervisory authorities. This was the case when it came to decision making for the six-pack for economic governance. We must also strengthen our co-legislative role for proposals for which we have advisory powers. We have proved that with the six-pack, too.</p>
<p class="contents">With this package, we want to create the momentum to make it as robust as possible for a stronger Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the UK, the socialist government gave away that power and it was a very expensive mistake. Therefore, the euro zone central bank supervision of euro zone banks makes some sense for the euro zone but not for those of us who are outside the euro zone. Also you cannot have strong supervision without strong rules. In our backroom negotiations on banking rules we are going round and round in circles. Sometimes a single rulebook is far from a single market and it feels as if, within that market, each market stallholder is setting their own standards. Sometimes those are far from the global minimum standards. In the cross-border world of banking that exposes us all to risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK supported the EBA to be a police enforcer to pull up standards across the single market. We must not confuse the role of the ECB as supervisor with that of the EBA as single market enforcer. Votes matter. If the ECB was to block-vote against the non-euro zone Member States and that was perceived as trying to drop standards within Europe, then that would undermine the euro zone even further. So the votes will matter.</p>

This project failed because of the Member States, and the Commission accepted the result. If things have changed, then I am unreservedly in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">However, serious concerns exist in relation to the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the legal basis; they also relate to the fact that all 6 000 banks in the euro area are now to be controlled by a European super-authority in the shape of the ECB. This proposal runs counter to the principle of subsidiarity, disempowers the national supervisory authorities and emasculates the European Banking Authority (EBA). New rules have been introduced that favour the non-euro area members of the EBA. In other words, this entire system will not lead to the implementation of uniform regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Council will not accept this proposal in this form. This is why Parliament has the right to insist on a different legal basis and thus, in particular, to make the EBA the cornerstone, rather than the European Central Bank. The establishment of uniform regulations for all locations and all authorities and banks is the right approach. Greater, risk-based distribution of supervision is also right. Last week, Mr Draghi said he was considering a matrix in the distribution of functions involving the balance sheet total, international business and risk weighting. I see no evidence of this in the proposal. The Commissioner has once again identified regional banks like Bankia, which has a balance sheet of EUR 310 billion, or Dexia with EUR 560 billion, or Northern Rock with EUR 150 billion, as small banks. This has been established within national competences, under EU competition law, not with excessive bank supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not my main point, however. I am also in favour of the fund, of restructuring, of the EUR 150 billion fund that Mr Van Rompuy is to propose. I am opposed to a uniform deposit guarantee scheme throughout Europe. After all, this would mean that first taxpayers, and then savers, would have to pay for the banking crisis. Parliament, or at least part of it, will resist this very strongly.</p>

The rules also defined by the Basel Committee state that: a large supervised financial investment company is considered large if it has a balance sheet valued at over EUR 70 billion. This is a workable yardstick. Following the principle of subsidiarity, why should smaller banks not also be supervised by the national authorities according to the same rules? Why not?

The proposal for a single banking supervisory mechanism, and in the longer term the setting up of a banking union has motivated my delegation to address a question to the European Commission. We are concerned primarily with the issue of the terms on which countries outside the eurozone would participate in the supervisory mechanism, countries such as Poland, whose government has already – probably too easily - indicated a willingness to surrender a part of its sovereignty. We await a detailed reply from the Commission regarding the functioning of this forced mechanism and its decision making process, which includes so-called voluntary members from outside the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is simple: how important will these countries be? Will they have a right to vote and what will they be able to influence? I am afraid that if there is further integration of banking in the eurozone, the impact will be felt also by financial institutions outside the eurozone, since capital is extensively and closely connected in the current global situation. We therefore call for a very detailed and careful approach in reaching a decision on this matter, and for the importance of those countries that form part of the European Union, but do not currently form part of the eurozone, to be taken into account also.</p>

It makes the decisions reached at the June summit more credible because it provides more concrete information. We must now turn to the legislation. A common currency needs a common supervisory authority for all banks, a common budget and a common tax policy, a common banking, fiscal, economic and social union, as well as a political union as an objective. The banking union is a tiny element along the way in learning lessons from the crisis and providing answers to the common currency. We might say, why not act immediately? We called for this two years ago, but were blocked by the Council until the autumn of last year. Let us not start blocking the proposals in every detail once again instead of setting to work implementing them and realising the goals. No more blocking tactics!</p>

That is the crucial decision that the European Council has taken and which involves conferring new powers on the European Central Bank, an institution which, in addition to being completely federal and integrated, has also shown its expertise since the beginning of the crisis of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is essential for this decision not to be questioned in the forthcoming legislative process.

<p class="contents">We should also be careful not to make public institutions, whether national or European, compete with each other. I understand that the European Banking Association (EBA) retains duties which are not insignificant, but it is clear, to my mind, that, of the two, it is the European Central Bank that is set to play a crucial role. The work that is starting now should not serve to reopen discussions which have been settled. The more complex and fragmented the supervisory architecture is in France, the less robust the European banking landscape will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not confer any rights, yet it immediately imposes obligations on the entrant without offering any protection. If a country does not join, it might be that it will not receive any information, meaning that it could be left out of everything. However, regardless of whether a country joins or not, if it is a non-euro-area country it will not have access to the ESM, meaning, Commissioner, that it can rely on its own strength alone.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened to each of your speeches with particular attention; please forgive me, for once, for not being able to respond to you individually, but I have to be away from the building shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would sincerely like to thank you for the wide range of points of view you have expressed, for the constructive and critical approach, which I welcome, that you have adopted towards these two regulations proposed by the Commission. What has cost taxpayers money, as I mentioned to some of you, is the fact that certain banks had been poorly supervised. What we propose is for banks, whatever their size, in the euro area and in any country that so wishes, for this is an open process, to be supervised in a serious, integrated and effective manner, precisely to protect consumers, companies and citizens. We shall go further, Mr Klute, on the question of consumer protection, over the next few months. The proposals that we have made are balanced. Many of you, Ms Bowles first of all, have mentioned the single market. I would like to point out that we must not confuse regulation with supervision. Regulation falls within the powers of the 27 countries and the single market, which I support, as do you, and for which we are responsible. We shall continue to create the different elements of this package with supervision for 27, with capitalisation for the 27 countries and 8 000 banks, with credit and deposit guarantee schemes and with dispute resolution systems. The 27 countries need this regulation, as well as the other two parts of the package that we will propose on the parallel banking system and the separation of risks in banks, following the Liikanen report. This regulation will belong to the 27 and to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here, because there is the euro on one hand and an additional need for stability on the other, is that within the euro area the personality and nature of the supervision will be different. It will be more integrated. Mr Langen, we shall take account of the role and position of national regulators. We are not going to do that from Frankfurt, on a daily basis, for all 6 000 banks. There will be work to be done in a coordinated framework, and it will be broadly decentralised at the level of all the banks. In our proposal I, as indeed all of us are, am extremely concerned about the ways in which those countries either not yet or not in the euro area could be associated to this regulatory system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you all already know, I, like President Barroso, am committed to Parliament. We were careful to plan for parliamentary control systems for this supervisory mechanism and I shall act as guarantor of the proper exercise of this parliamentary control in the introduction of this new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the stability of the euro area, because that is what is at issue, is not of concern only to the countries of the euro area. It concerns the whole of Europe. When the euro area is fragile, when it is in crisis, Europe as a whole suffers the consequences. We must give ourselves the means to guarantee the stability of this area. This is not the only response, but it is a fundamental and far-reaching element, I admit, in terms of integration in the euro area to guarantee the stability of this area and, beyond that, the stability of the entire single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the short term, it had to underwrite limitless sovereign debt to save the euro and to overcome the unfair financial instability in several countries for the benefit of others, but in the medium and long term there is a need to change the baton and rhythm of this out-of-tune European orchestra. Instead of cutting back on consolidated rights, it needs to be tough on profiteers, tax havens and subsidies for unproductive companies. There needs to be more union and political decisiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposal to equalise income made by a leader, as long as it is not an obstacle, meaning that the countries with healthier finances, which earn through borrowing money, stop stimulating their own economy and those of their neighbours and partners in the common European company.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Asturias, for example, my constituency of origin, an important French newspaper asked whether the closed coalmines would need to be reopened on yesterday’s front page. Let us consider very carefully whether it would be better not to close those that remain open, which provide energy and social security. I was a tennis player, and I know that after you have saved a ‘match point’ the next return of serve is equally or even more important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
