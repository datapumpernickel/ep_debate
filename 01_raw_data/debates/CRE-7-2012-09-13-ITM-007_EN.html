Works that are locked away in this manner often constitute up to 45% of the entire collections of these institutions. Cultural heritage should be useful to society and not just be imprisoned by copyright. This issue affects all kinds of publications: books, newspapers, photographs, radio and TV recordings. Speaking as a person who has worked for many years in the cultural sphere, it is important for me for this problem to be resolved on a legislative level throughout the European Union in order to return these forgotten works to society by digitising them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that in March of this year, the Committee on Legal Affairs adopted my report on the use of orphan works. It states that, if extensive investigations show that identifying the author or the copyright holder of a work is not possible, the work can achieve ‘orphan’ status. This means it will be possible to make the work publicly available on a non-commercial basis, which means without making a profit. It will also be possible to store and restore works digitally. In addition, a work that has been deemed to be an orphan in one country will automatically gain ‘orphan’ status in others. If, however, the author or copyright holder comes forward, then they can request appropriate compensation if they can show that they incurred real losses by their work being made available in this way. In my opinion, this is an excellent example of the fact that relaxing rather than strengthening copyright law could be beneficial for all parties. During my work as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have conducted negotiations on this issue, first of all with the Council under the Polish Presidency, then under the Danish Presidency, and today my report will be put to the vote in plenary, which will mean the realisation of one of the priorities of the Cyprus Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a derogation to the law on intellectual property in order to make cultural heritage available through public institutions for educational purposes and in order to disseminate culture will open a new chapter in intellectual property law. This is a particularly important directive, since it is the first to establish a legislative basis in a new and so far unregulated area of law. As a result, the beneficiaries, who so far have avoided digitisation out of concerns about any court cases for huge amounts of compensation if an author should come forward, can now breathe easily. Compensation worked out by way of a compromise will ensure legal certainty in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Works that have many owners, that is, so-called ‘partial orphan works’, can also be digitised and made available to a wide range of users. Libraries, archives and museums have long been waiting for clear regulations that would allow them to make available treasures that have been hidden away for years and to prevent them from being forgotten or even destroyed. The digitisation which, thanks to this directive, will finally be possible, solves this problem. However, what is most important, and this I count as one of the greatest successes in our negotiations, is that thanks to the new Article 6(2), public institutions will have a real opportunity to generate income from the use of orphan works, which will supplement the small sums allocated for the digitisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Commercial use of works is given a precise definition in the text and is linked to the issue of compensation for the author if the author should appear. As regards this issue, too, I believe that we were able to reach a balanced compromise between protecting copyright and the possibility of a derogation for the use of orphan works. What is more, we put in a provision in the review clause stating that, a year after the directive comes into force, the European Commission should consider its effects and introduce any changes or improvements that are required and, if necessary, also introduce a wider range of beneficiaries to include, for example, private institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations were difficult. We did not always agree on all the issues but I am pleased with the final compromise solutions and am convinced that this directive will be a useful and effective tool to make cultural artefacts that have been hidden away available to a larger number of users. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs as well as the European Commission and the Council for the fruitful negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important milestone because this directive will help our public libraries, archives, museums, educational establishments and broadcasters to bring a significant part of the EU’s cultural heritage back to life. It will allow this heritage to be more easily available online for all our citizens to enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is important not only because it is a tangible implementation of the intellectual property strategy adopted by the Commission last year, but also because it proves that by working together, it is possible to bridge the gap between copyright and technology in the Internet age. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Angelika Niebler, Ms Alexandra Thein and Mr Christian Engström, for their constructive and collaborative approach, which made it possible to reach a compromise agreement at first reading with the Council and the Member States. Let me take this opportunity also to congratulate the Presidencies of Poland, Denmark and now Cyprus for their work and their commitment to ensuring a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us targets the specific copyright issues relating to orphan works. The lack of knowledge about who owns the rights to a literary, musical or audiovisual work presents our cultural institutions with a dilemma: how can they digitise and put the works online, so that everyone can access them without infringing copyright. The directive resolves that dilemma. It provides our cultural institutions with the legal certainty they need to use orphan works, once they have carried out a diligent search to identify the rights holders.</p>
<p class="contents">The text before us is, in some ways, different to the one that we presented to you last year. I will mention, for example, the inclusion of unpublished works and of so-called ‘partial orphan works’, or the setting up of an EU-wide database on orphan works, which will avoid the multiplicity of databases at national level and make it easier for rights holders and beneficiaries to check the status of the use of orphan works. These are very positive changes that the Commission welcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the flexibility shown by the colegislators to enable the beneficiaries to retrieve some of the digitisation costs by allowing them to generate revenues when they use orphan works in the pursuit of their mission of public interest. This is an important consideration, especially given the economic difficulties we currently face.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that reappearing rights holders, as the case may be, will be entitled to fair compensation for the use made of their works if a number of criteria are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">The constructive discussions that we have today and have had over the past year demonstrate our mutual interest in building a digital single market, step by step, block by block, but we must make sure that both European citizens and our cultural institutions are in a position to reap the benefits of the directive as soon as possible. I therefore urge the Council, after Parliament, to support the compromise text agreed in trialogues last June. I would also like to call on the Member States to ensure a timely implementation of the directive once it enters into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the directive, books, films, photographs or other intellectual creations for which no rights holder can be found are to be made available to the public. This will create a cultural treasure trove. For us in the Committee on Culture and Education, it was of very particular importance to emphasise the special importance of the diversity of the cultural heritage of the European Union in this legislative initiative. In the archives of our museums, libraries, publishing houses and broadcasters, countless unused works are to be found which, until now, were not made available purely because the rights holders were unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will change that. It will make it possible for these cultural assets to be used in future, provided that it is ensured that a diligent search is carried out before publication. This is a very important point, as it prevents people from breezily declaring that the rights holder just cannot be found. There is a need, after all, to find a balance between the real, existing rights of the creators of works and the public’s need to be able to use works where the rights situation cannot be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, there is a particular focus on the need to ensure that both known and unknown rights holders must continue to be fully protected. Where rights holders cannot be found, the proposals make it possible to make use of the digitisation of the orphan works. Projects such as Europeana, and other major European digitisation projects, but also our museums, archives, educational institutions and public broadcasters, will benefit from this arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, however, orphan works in the archives of private publishers must also be made available to the public. In my view, this draft directive and the compromise that has now been reached really represent a compromise and a first step in the right direction. I believe that the cultural treasure trove that is up for grabs holds an enormous potential. We should continue to work on that when we revise the directive in two years’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The adoption of this directive provides a solution to a particular problem, that is the use of books, archives and other works protected by copyright when the rights holders have not been identified.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in striking a balance between protecting authors and creators, meaning that a diligent search should be carried out prior to use of the work, and the interests of libraries, museums and public service broadcasters. Let us not forget that these bodies contribute to the preservation and dissemination of European cultural heritage. It was essential to allow them to use these works, but also to finalise agreements, including public-private partnership agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We must understand that this directive is not the final step but merely an additional step towards our objective: the large-scale digitisation of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will coexist with other national regulations and with initiatives at European level, such as the Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation of Out-of-Commerce Works, which was signed on 20 September 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of this directive on orphan works, we are showing that copyright is not a hindrance, but rather a response to the needs and expectations of users in the digital age.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for intellectual property goes hand in hand with the development and provision of new digital services, and it therefore encourages the growth of this economic sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a very good opportunity, and I think we missed it. There was a proposal from the Commission, which was limited in scope and I would have wanted it to be better, but it was good. Unfortunately, it got watered down, first by the processing in Parliament, then in the Committee and then in the trialogue. So, what we have now is a directive that, on the surface, if you read it through quickly, gives the impression or the hope that it will be helpful. I do not think it will be, in practice, because there are so many details that restrict what the museums, archives and libraries are allowed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one very good thing in this directive: it introduces the new principle of mutual recognition of orphan work status after a diligent search. That is a very good and sensible principle. This means that, for example, if it is a Swedish author, you only have to search in Sweden – unless there are specific reasons to think that an author may be found elsewhere but, basically, for a Swedish author you search in Sweden, and then it is declared orphan all over the Union. That is good, but where are the provisions?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission proposal, there was an Article 7 that allowed museums and libraries to do some, quite limited, searches but still to have some commercial possibilities – that was taken out. Instead, what was inserted in it was that the museums and libraries will have a liability if they digitise and make available a work and the right holder reappears. Now, we all agree that, if a right holder reappears, he or she should have the right to say: take it down, here I am, and this is mine. That is fine. But what was added also was that the museums and libraries have to pay compensation. Now, the risk is that this will make the directive more or less useless anyway because, if they do not have the legal certainty, there is a big risk that they will not dare to digitise our common cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want the same thing here. We would all love to see Europeana filled with lots of works from every Member State. Unfortunately, I do not think this directive will do that. Ms Gallo said that this is not the end of the road, and I want to pick up that. Several other speakers have also said that this is a first step. Yes, it is a first step. It is a very small step, but we will have to return to this. We have not solved the problem, and that makes me a little bit sad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The digitisation of cultural works represents a serious issue: the issue of access to our heritage for as many people as possible. However, it must be done with strict respect for copyright, and therefore by guaranteeing remuneration for authors. Reconciling these issues is the focus of our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather tragic that European citizens do not have access to part of this cultural heritage because the authors are not or are no longer known. The digitisation of works must therefore come about through strict respect for the public interest missions of the public bodies concerned. Yet, in this period of budgetary austerity, forgive me, but it seems to me that Google is casting something of a shadow over our work.</p>
<p class="contents">Within our group, we are concerned about the use of certain provisions contained in the draft that has been presented to us. Why, for example, should out-of-commerce works be excluded when many of these are orphan works? What is worse is that respect for public-private partnerships risks leaving the door wide open for the commercialisation of this sector.</p>

This directive, like all other projects relating to the issue of protecting intellectual property rights, aroused considerable emotion and controversy. Regulating access to works that are real cultural treasures, but which are currently languishing on the shelves of libraries and numerous archives may seem to be a very small step, but it is, without doubt, a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present atmosphere of general confusion surrounding the very definition of intellectual property and the rights conferred by that definition, in an atmosphere of heated discussion that pays little attention to substantive issues but is inflamed by various groups which – using defence of liberty as their catchword – are interested in obtaining free access to almost anything that someone else has created or invented, especially if such access should take place via the Internet, Ms Geringer de Oedenberg’s report is like a light in the darkness. It is a light which gives hope that a discussion concerning the protection of creative thinking in the European Union will take place at a realistic level, supported by proper arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on this dossier has shown that it is possible to bring together views that initially appeared to be very divergent. What is necessary, and perhaps this needs to be spelt out, is to undertake a dialogue based on rational argument that takes into account the situation both of the creators and of the users. For this reason, I also hope that work on future legislation in the area of intellectual property will be conducted in the spirit of substantive discussion that does not get exploited for populist appeals and various types of political manoeuvring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach.</p>
<p class="contents">The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am assured by practitioners in the field that access to European cultural assets will not, to this extent, open up access to our cultural heritage following the entry into force of this legislation. In essence, the truth is that, the longer the duration of copyright – and sadly we extended that a little while ago – the bigger the problem. It goes without saying that the same situation applies to orphan works.</p>
<p class="contents">A documentary in which the writer of a piece of music played in the background can no longer be traced will ultimately remain barred and not traceable for us, as the devil is in the detail of this legislation. We have built in a great many small obstacles to making works available.

The purpose of the directive is not, as agreed with the Council, to save, maintain, promote, disseminate and grant access to cultural creations and heritage; it is a highly profitable activity in the form of the large-scale digitisation of archives and collections and the creation of European online libraries.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, everyone agrees that our European cultural heritage should be disseminated and that so-called orphan works should be freely accessible, but that is not what is at issue here. The directive uses cleverly worded provisions to very openly pave the way for the commercialisation of orphan works and use of them for the benefit of private capital. Thus, firstly, research to locate authors can be outsourced to private companies for a consideration and, secondly, digitisation can be outsourced to private individuals, through public-private partnerships, and user charges can be imposed on the pretext of the digitisation of such works. Thus, the entire job of digitisation and sales will be handled by business groups and the workers will be required to pay dearly to use these works. We see yet again that all decisions by the European Union result in commercialisation. This policy lays a bomb under the foundations of culture and is a policy that must be changed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to maintain the diversity of European culture, it is therefore necessary to make these works available at cross-border level.</p>
<p class="contents">Orphan works are works whose right holder cannot be identified or found. We are therefore not coming into conflict with copyright ownership. Making works available to the public, however, requires the permission of the rights holders, in accordance with the principles of copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently applicable European legislation does, however, provide for certain exceptions that allow scanning for preservation purposes, but they do not allow libraries to make the digitised works available online on the Internet, even for non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in the digital era, however. The rational dissemination of information online can bring enormous advantages to the internal market. We should also be encouraging the digitisation of cultural material at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has, in the past, expressed its support for the idea of finding a legislative solution to the problematic area of these so-called orphan works. A new law in the future will enable Europe-wide online access to these works. The Commission’s proposal is therefore more than welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Copyright is the foundation for innovation, creation, investment and production in the creative industries. We must, however, improve the system currently in force and adapt it to today’s digital world. Online accessibility of the so-called orphan works across the EU will lead to the promotion of Europe’s cultural diversity and to broader sources of knowledge and education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. It is still a shame that this is a directive and not a regulation because, as you know, I am strongly in favour of regulations which work in the same way in all Member States. However, now we will again see different ways of implementing the directive and that is a shame.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that copyright has been included in the directive and is now recognised as an economic basis for the creative sector. It is now unambiguously included and I hope we all agree on that point, because it is important. It is time we started thinking about new business models in the context of new technologies and the digital age because we have now been debating the issue of access to one thing or another and whether or not they may be copied for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is important that we as politicians, as Parliament, start looking for a new European approach to copyright in order to bring this debate to an end in view of the digital age that lies ahead. What is a shame, and what has not been included in the directive, is the provision that copyright only takes effect if the author is known. If orphan works are now digitised, and if the author becomes known only after the event, I fear this could lead to legal action that could throw up difficulties in terms of making that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, I think we have achieved a good outcome and I hope that Europe’s cultural heritage will become accessible to a wide audience as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As ever in situations of this kind, the question that arises is: is the glass half-full or half-empty? From my point of view, there are open questions here, and there are also problems that have not been resolved. That is not something I am happy about, but I nevertheless believe that, in the current situation, it is incredibly important to now be able to provide a legal status to orphan works. We have fought for that for a long time. It is a tangible improvement. Further steps must follow. That is why the envisaged review clause is important, so that, in two years’ time, we can evaluate what our experiences are and what shortcomings there are.

<p class="contents">The non-commercial use of orphan works could indeed add social and economic value to society as a whole, but we believe that copyright principles must be safeguarded. If used for commercial purposes, it is vital that compensation be paid to copyright protection organisations or to other state organisations, since direct remuneration of the authors, artists or creators is impossible in the case of orphan works.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we repeat that the objective of this recognition must never be to promote the diffusion of the works for the purpose of consolidating the single market and competition between companies, which would allow the ownership of these works to be monopolised. It must solely be to disseminate cultural heritage in the different Member States and in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights.

The problem is, however, that if we lock away so many of these works, all that withers away. If we cannot find rights holders and the search for them is so costly and associated with legal uncertainty, something is going badly wrong. That leads to these works not being orphaned, but lost. We urgently need innovation in Europe. Research and development are to be promoted. Clearly, in order to bring that situation about, we need simple legal, cross-border online access to these orphan works, as one piece in the jigsaw.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, and many of the shadow rapporteurs have produced a fine piece of work. I do note, however, that there are a few spanners in the works, as I see them, in the compromises. The report contains many positive elements. It is an important first step. The next step, however – and thank goodness that a review clause was provided – must be approached in an even more committed manner. It is good that this is being regulated at European level at all. It is good that the principle of mutual recognition is to be included. The rules governing partially orphaned works and, in particular, the practically significant rule that a database of orphan works is to be established, are particularly worthy of note.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules governing the diligent search are sound in principle, as is the fact that we now talk of compensation rather than remuneration. Here, too, however, you can see the glass as half-full or half-empty, as legal uncertainties remain, and here, too, we may be dealing with something of a sword of Damocles for those who attempt to perform as diligent a search as possible when trying to discover the creator, but who have no ultimate certainty in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called ‘profit ban’ on profit-oriented exploitation is more than a fly in the ointment. I say the ‘so-called’ profit ban, as profits will clearly continue to be made, the question is always just, by whom? The majority of the works will thus continue to rest dormant.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind everyone of our own goal. We should prevent there being so many orphan works in Europe in the first place. In this respect, the long durations of protection are, of course, the major cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that today, we can send two important and significant messages to our citizens. The first is that we have a great opportunity to speed up the digitisation of cultural works in Europe: all those hundreds of thousands of works that today are kept in the archives of museums and libraries and that cannot, for legal reasons, be made more widely available. Young people today – and this is particularly the case with young people – are mobile, so the issue of searching for cultural works is of profound importance and this is, in practice, available only via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, thanks to the legal provisions that we are considering today, there will be an opportunity for all public institutions, libraries and institutes of learning to offer the possibility of publishing these works. I believe that all the solutions that have been used here, including, <span class="italic">inter alia, </span>mutual recognition of works, could be a good step in the direction of making cultural heritage in the European Union very widely available. Many congratulations to all those who worked on this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to the legislative process regarding copyright protection and cultural and creative industries that was started at European level recently, Europe is beginning to catch up, and this has a positive impact on our competitiveness. Similarly, in respect of orphan works, we are attempting to find a solution to a need which will facilitate the work of researchers, students and EU citizens. The digital world often knows no bounds. An appropriate EU legal framework, however, can ensure the protection of copyright holders and users as well. Parliament has added substantive elements to this proposal, including an extension of its material scope to photographic works of art.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive intends to reduce the informational and knowledge gap between the United States and Europe. In the future, it would be better if European legislators did not just seek to respond to policies outside the EU. European legal culture has sufficient potential to ensure a well-functioning, modern background of legal protection even in cross-border cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Copyright helps encourage innovation, investment and production. In other words, it provides the foundation for the creative sector.

<p class="contents">I am personally in favour of cultural and educational institutions being allowed to use orphan works to meet specific objectives.

Ensuring the European publicity of such works and harmonising the various Member State legal practices in this regard is vital to the preservation of European cultural heritage.

<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by offering my thanks to the rapporteur for her work on the amendments and on the whole text. I hope that this will resolve the legal difficulties in which we have been entangled and will provide wide-ranging access to orphan works. This is particularly important in the context of protests submitted by organisations involved in the dissemination of knowledge. They have been telling us for a long time now about the problems involved in using this type of material, for example, in audiovisual processes. The directive under consideration and the proposed amendments provide greater flexibility, particularly as regards non-profit activities, although these clauses would not appear to be well adapted to market requirements. As many as 69% of those asked on one website said that they were in favour of the possibility of using orphan works for profit. It is therefore worth considering the possibility of making further amendments to the directive in order to make it possible to use orphan works commercially. This would provide a strong stimulus to make them more widely available, and this type of change would also increase the number of potential beneficiaries. As regards the amendments themselves, I am pleased to see that the interests of any heirs of authors of works have been protected. On the other hand, this imposes legal conditions on institutions that are difficult to fulfil. Over the long term, this may mean the road that books, photographs and pictures have to travel before reaching a wide audience is somewhat longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that soon, many pearls of our culture and heritage which have so far been hidden will see the light of day and be available to a wide audience, and I think that this is a first step, perhaps a small one, but nevertheless an important step, towards full harmonisation of copyright law throughout the European Union in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Danish Presidency for very fruitful cooperation, and I would particularly like to thank Ambassador Liisberg. I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for many useful meetings and discussions, along with Commissioner Kroes who, one could say, was the fairy godmother for this project. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs, Angelika Niebler, who was a shadow rapporteur, and Mariella Gallo, who was very committed to the work. I would also like to thank Alexandra Thein, who is with us today, for her support, and also Christian Engström, even though we differed on some issues, but this was a very important discussion. I would also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs and all the assistants who worked with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised by the position taken by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, which supported our work throughout the negotiation period and expressed their support, or at other times did not take part in negotiations. I am surprised by your position, taken at the last moment, that you wish to abstain. I would encourage you to support a good first step towards harmonisation of that part of copyright law that relates to orphan works. Thank you and I would encourage you to vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps, therefore, there is a problem with the discussion you have had, but as far as I am concerned, I usually participate in this kind of work.

So there must be a problem within the GUE/NGL Group.

If the author cannot be found and consent cannot be obtained, the relevant work cannot then be used. As protection lasts for a very long time (the author’s lifetime + 70 years) and the number of works published continues to grow, these cases are being encountered ever more frequently. Ignoring the fact that, in general, these works are actually used more often without consent being requested, I think that, legally speaking, there is a problem that needs to be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the report also addresses the matter of rights holders being able to request that their works not be considered ‘orphan works’ and, at the same time, provides appropriate protection for public institutions. I believe that the latter refrain from using such works for fear that without the consent of the right holder, they could be fined millions of euro. It is not unusual for such works to constitute 70% of the collections of some institutions. Additionally, I would like to point out that I personally did not consider the European Commission’s legal policy starting point to be constructive; I feel that it is much more a partially negative response to the book digitisation project launched by Google. As such, the model to be introduced under the directive could certainly be able to effectively compete with this US company in the short and medium term, but in the long term, it would once again fall by the wayside due to the failure to establish a legislative environment enabling creative use in a digital environment. I commend the rapporteur for recognising this possibility; she guided the original proposal in the right direction, emphasising that we should move towards new areas in legislation as well. As Ms Geringer de Oedenberg mentioned, the new European model must facilitate the creation of a simplified procedural system. I fully agree with her on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
