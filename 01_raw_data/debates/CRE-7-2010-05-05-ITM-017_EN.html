Der Sommer war sehr groß...</span>’<span class="italic">.</span> Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard.</p>
<p class="contents">That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP’s mandate lasts for five years. This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36). The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36).</p>
<p class="contents">Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports. I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference. As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term. Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate. I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I am going to ask for a ‘yes’ vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved. We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This particular case is quite paradoxical, because both Mr Méndez de Vigo and I formed part of the Convention that drew up a Constitution for Europe. In this case, the aim is to try and avoid this procedure, given that we are dealing with a very minor change – just one of form, in fact – to the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that in this way, if Parliament passes the motion put forward by Mr Méndez de Vigo, and after an Intergovernmental Conference has been held and the corresponding ratification procedures have been completed in the 27 parliaments of the European Union Member States, a further 18 MEPs from 12 countries – the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Poland, the Netherlands, Malta, Latvia, Italy, Bulgaria, Sweden, France, Austria and Spain – can come as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the citizens of these countries will be even better represented in the European Parliament. That is why I am pleased that this report has been drawn up by Mr Méndez de Vigo and that it has been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the form that he proposed. I also hope that there will be widespread approval here at this plenary session and that we will be able to see these 18 missing MEPs here in Parliament as soon as possible, and that this will be provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Council had requested the opinion of the Commission acting on the proposal from the Spanish Government and, since the Spanish Government’s proposal reflects the long-standing political agreement to bring the additional 18 MEPs into office without delay, the Commission has recommended opening an intergovernmental conference as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to express the hope of the Commission that the limited Treaty changes to be discussed at this IGC will be agreed quickly and the ratification by Member States will allow the additional 18 MEPs to take up their mandate as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations. This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not. Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position. We therefore support what has already been said. Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it – even if it is my amendment – since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we are revising the Treaty. Soon after it came into force, we are, for the first time, proposing a revision of the Treaty. This is no light matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, however, what we are doing is restoring, confirming and creating the chance for 18 MEPs, who would have had the right to take their seats if the Treaty had been approved before the elections, to exercise that right. Moreover, we are enabling 12 countries that have the right to rearrange their situation in this Parliament, because they have an agreement with the entire European Union that they should have greater representation than at present, to exercise that right. That is all this is about, but it is an important question.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Treaty itself requires that a Convention be held to revise the Treaty. The Council quite reasonably asks us if it is necessary to hold a Convention in order to ratify an agreement reached with all of the EU Member States. Parliament responds that there is no need. There is no need on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore mandates the Council to convene an Intergovernmental Conference and to revise the Treaty, thus giving rise to the possibility that the 27 countries ratify the revision, thereby enabling the 18 MEPs to come here and the 12 countries involved to attain their full level of parliamentary representation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we are dealing with, but there is a problem. To begin with, I would like to acknowledge the fact that we had some difficulty when it came to determining if those who are coming necessarily have to be directly elected for these seats, or if they can be elected in some other way.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this problem that has come up, which must be examined and presented realistically, has been satisfactorily resolved. I wish to thank not only the rapporteur for the report, Mr Méndez de Vigo, but Mr Duff also, for the fact that we have managed to come to what is, in my view, a very important agreement among the three groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What we say is, yes, let the Treaty be revised, but without a Convention, so that a start can be made to the right to that confirmation. At the same time, however, this House would remind the national parliaments that they must send Members who have been directly elected to the European Parliament, and that here in Parliament we intend to carry out a revision of the European electoral system in order to endow the European electoral model with a unified, supranational system for electing its Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that these two considerations have enabled a balance to be struck, so that this matter can be reopened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look forward to the enlargement of Parliament and we look forward to 18 new Members. We want to create the conditions for this now so that they can come and work together with us.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one small difference of opinion, which in truth is actually very large, because it concerns the basis of our work, including our understanding of the principle of democracy and our appreciation of this House itself. It concerns the question of who decides who these new Members will be. For us, that is not a secondary issue, it is a key question. According to the Treaty, Members of the European Parliament ‘shall be elected for a term of five years by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot’. It is the citizens who do the electing. In 11 out of 12 countries that is what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">One country is now saying that that is not possible and that they will send us MEPs who were elected by their citizens for a totally different job. We do not consider that to be a satisfactory way to treat Parliament or the right of the citizens to vote and the principle of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We could dispense with a convention if this were merely a technical issue, in other words if we had agreed on the principle of compliance with the Treaties.

We doubtless also disagree on many things where the European Parliament is concerned. However, I believe that there is broad consensus that what gives the European Parliament legitimacy is that it is democratically and directly elected by the citizens. So, here we are today with a proposal that forces us to face the fact that this can change. A proposal is on the table that could put us in a situation in which, in the next four years, things can be adopted in this Parliament by people who have not been democratically elected, but rather appointed. I think this is a very bad development. I also think it is a very unfortunate development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, contrary to the Treaty. We would therefore have to revise the Treaty. However, it is also contrary to what we actually do in practice. When Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, did we tell them that they did not need to hold elections? Did we say that the Members from these countries could sit for two-and-a-half years without elections being held? No, we instructed them to hold elections, and that is what should be done in the case of new Members.

For years we have heard how the Treaty of Lisbon would be the instrument to ensure democracy, transparency and citizens’ influence on legislation in the EU. Then one of the first things the European Parliament chooses to do after telling citizens this for years is to say no to direct elections, no to convening a convention and no to all of the instruments that we have used in the past to convince citizens why this Treaty was necessary. There is something rather strange about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural thing to do, of course, would be for us to take seriously the promises we made to the electorate, to take seriously the fact that this House should be made up of people with a direct popular mandate, and to take seriously the fact that it is not governments but elected representatives who change the Treaties. Both of these fundamental elements – and, incidentally, fundamental promises – will be destroyed if the two reports are adopted. The whole idea, indeed the whole argument for having the Treaty of Lisbon – everything that was intended to convince citizens why they should give even more power to the EU – is precisely what we are turning our back on today now that we have got what we wanted.

Paragraph 2 of Mr Méndez de Vigo’s report rightly emphasises the fact that one of the Council’s proposals goes completely against the spirit of the 1976 Act. It concerns the appointment, by the national parliaments, of MEPs who, under the 1976 Act, must be elected by direct universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect to the rapporteur, I regret that he has not taken greater account of this and addressed it in a stricter, clearer and more uncompromising way in paragraph 5. It is not at all impossible to stick to the election. If the Member States do not wish to hold by-elections, they should simply consider the outcome of the election that took place in 2009 and apply, on a proportionate basis, the outcome of that vote to the new number of MEPs who have just been assigned to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Any other solution is undemocratic, especially in my country, France, where the national parliament is appointed on a non-proportional basis, without proportional rule. This would be, in fact, a form of governmental appointment that goes against the spirit of the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this unfortunate hitch will not leave problems in its wake and that the credibility of our institutions and our project will not be undermined. I shall give you a specific example: Italy is required to elect one MEP in a possible additional election, but should we be more concerned that we would have an election with a likely turnout of no more than 5% of the electorate, or that we would refer to the results of the last elections of 2009 in order to confirm the election of an MEP elected, in any case, by direct universal suffrage?</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, we must not make the situation worse: never before has it been more important for Europe to avoid institutional obstacles and delays in the process of integration. I, too, would highlight how important it is for all 18 MEPs to take up their seats in the European Parliament at the same time, in order to avoid upsetting the delicate balance between the nationalities represented in the House. This is a question – I repeat – that must be resolved immediately: I find it unthinkable that the new Members may not be elected to Parliament for the remainder of the 2009-2014 term.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must urgently adopt the recommendation and report in question so that amendment of Protocol No 36 to the Treaty of Lisbon will be given the go-ahead, without convening a convention, but by directly convening an intergovernmental conference, as proposed by the rapporteur. Indeed, we must take the quickest path, because at this stage there is little to discuss. Instead, we need to turn the page and make a fresh, constructive start following what has been, unfortunately, a very negative episode. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see no need to convene a convention. It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified. Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too. We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable. The ball is therefore back in the Council’s court. I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner. I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Méndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process. However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament. That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that. Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This higher number is to be achieved by 18 seats being distributed amongst 12 Member States and Germany losing three seats, but this cannot take place as it is unlawful to prematurely curtail the mandate of the three German MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">A further complication is that the Treaty stipulates the total number of MEPs shall not exceed 751. To include the 18 additional MEPs without losing the three German seats will require a revision of Protocol 36 of the Lisbon Treaty. This should be achieved by a convention producing proposals for agreement by Member States for incorporation into the Treaty by way of amendment. Failure to do this would render unlawful any act this Parliament takes on the basis of a 754-strong Chamber – three over the limit of 751.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before this House is that this problem be dealt with by way of an intergovernmental conference, but this is a significant revision and amendment to the Lisbon Treaty requiring ratification by all Member States and providing the opportunity for individual national referenda.

<p class="contents">Let me thank Íñigo and the coordinators for taking the decision. It was not easy. We had a problem with designating an additional 18 Members of this House because certain Member States did not actually plan for a procedure, but we decided that representativeness is the most important issue, that this is the principle which we should be guided by and that this House should have a balanced representation as quickly as possible. That is why we took a pragmatic solution, prompting Member States to complete their election procedures as quickly as possible, provided, obviously, that all the parliamentarians who are going to join us are going to be directly elected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, then, can one fail to be surprised at the total lack of preparation of a country – mine, as it happens, France – with regard to the appointment of its two new MEPs? Could it not have reasonably assumed that the Treaty of Lisbon would one day enter into force and that the issue of the new MEPs would be raised? What explains, then, such a lack of foresight, such a casual attitude?</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, by offering France the possibility, under the draft Protocol No 36, to go ahead and appoint MEPs within the national parliament – thereby allowing it to save face at little cost – we actually risk infringing the fundamental rule that stipulates that Members of the European Parliament must be elected by direct universal suffrage. This goes against the spirit of the 1976 Act on the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, and would undermine the very legitimacy and credibility of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, for their part, the elected representatives of the 11 other Member States who have been duly elected must not pay the price for such amateurishness. This situation has simply gone on for too long, for them and for their countries, and it is only right that these elected representatives be able to join us as quickly as possible and set to work. That is why we believe that this issue should be resolved via an intergovernmental conference that could quickly approve the appointment of these Members.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must insist that France fulfils its obligations just as its European partners have. Arrangements of this kind are unacceptable in the heart of the Chamber that brings together the representatives of the European people. In spite of everything, this debate will have had the virtue of implicitly demonstrating the need to make provision, in the future, for a uniform means of electing MEPs by direct universal suffrage. This reform will, for its part, have to be achieved by means of a convention. Once again, it is the voice of the peoples that must carry weight here, in this Chamber, not that of the governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an Austrian, I very much look forward to seeing Joe Weidenholzer here and I hope that we shall be able to welcome him here as a Member of Parliament as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has of course been caused, among other things, by our different election systems, which give rise to democracy-related problems. In France, for example, where candidates stand at a regional level and no lists are available, it is not very difficult to allow Members to move up. We should speak out clearly in favour of an election and not selection by a parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would also make perfect sense – and this is what the citizens expect – for us to provide specific information on the activities and earnings of Members during the observation period. This ‘phantom’ situation will certainly not do much for citizens’ confidence in the EU. We also need to provide clarification as quickly as possible as to when the new Members should come and what status they should have. Moreover, it is still not clear whether the Treaty of Lisbon will be re-examined – which would be desirable – and what the situation is with regard to Croatia’s accession. Citizens expect a quick resolution of this matter by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that it entered into force six months ago now, an intergovernmental conference to implement these changes still has not been convened. The Member States have to ratify a special protocol concerning the additional number of Members of the European Parliament. This is a big operation, but it does not alter the fact that the Treaty must be implemented in full and without delay. I share the position presented on this matter by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that it is in the interest of those Member States which have an increased national delegation under the provisions of the Treaty for their new Members to be able to represent their electorate as soon as possible. This is in accord with the fundamental democratic principles upon which the Union is based.

That is why, in the last analysis, I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo, who proposes that there is no need for a Convention, that an Intergovernmental Conference be called as soon as possible, that the 27 Member States’ parliaments ratify the decision at the earliest opportunity, and that, as a result, the 18 MEPs in question can be seen in this Parliament, as they should have been here from the outset of this parliamentary term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore I very much welcome the pragmatic approach of Mr Méndez de Vigo and the report which he prepared, and, as I can gather from the debate, it is also getting very strong support here in the plenary. I think it is very clear that our common goal is to have 18 new MEPs as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the Commission’s position, I think we have been asked very straightforward questions about how this change should be administered and through which instrument. The Commission has agreed very clearly to the IGC because of the scope and nature of the change which will be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the modalities of how the additional MEPs are chosen, this would be, I am sure, raised within the framework of an intergovernmental conference, but let me add: when the European Council was considering this matter, I think that it was quite clear that the Council was looking to seek a balance, a balance between the natural desirability that the additional MEPs are chosen in a way as close as possible to the European Parliament elections themselves and the need to respect national constitutional arrangements; that is the origin of the three options to cover the realities of today’s situation which of course will be regularised at the next elections.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude let me also welcome the internal reflections within the European Parliament about possible future changes to the European elections, but I think that we have to underline that these are, and should remain, different issues. Today we are discussing how to get 18 additional MEPs into the European Parliament. Next time we will be discussing possible changes to the electoral vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome. Therefore, we coordinators – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr Jáuregui and Mr Duff – have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow. I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament. By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark.</p>
<p class="contents">In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Šefčovič, among others, have also highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree. Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter <span class="italic">en bloc</span>, otherwise we would lose representativeness.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for them to enter <span class="italic">en bloc</span>, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report. Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one.</p>

I am not talking only on behalf of Malta which has been allocated the 6th seat but also with regards to all the other countries which found themselves in the same position. It is a fact that there are legal and constitutional constraints to be overcome in order for the new European parliamentarians to take their rightful seats. On the other hand the time which has elapsed from the EP elections of June 2009 illustrates that the EU has become a cumbersome institution which takes months, if not years, to activate parts of the Lisbon Treaty which was finally approved less than 6 months ago. Apart from the deficiency in representation regarding the countries involved, there is another element which I feel requires immediate attention. I am referring to the human element. Eighteen prospective parliamentarians must be going through a very difficult period in their life especially from the psychological point of view. I am sure that there isn't one present European parliamentarian who does not understand the plight of these eighteen politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
