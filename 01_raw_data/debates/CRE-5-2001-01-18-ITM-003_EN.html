<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seppänen (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank those who helped to have the debate on this report moved to a time when we can speak about it and vote on it today, in the daytime. If the report had been discussed in the evening it would have been insulting to the four million employees directly or indirectly connected with the forestry industry cluster. This sector is responsible for a tenth of the total industrial output for the EU and a third of the world’s forest industry production. All of us present here know the problems that the Thursday evening sittings will pose from this day on.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate on the Commission communication it became apparent that the Forestry Industry Cluster is extremely heterogeneous. Publishers and printing works use paper and other forest industry products, but many of them see themselves mainly as content producers. The content industry’s output is characterised, not just by its use of paper, but also by the new electronic industry: electronic communication. The report expresses the hope that the Commission will also take account of the special features of competitiveness in these new industries. The report recommends that the peat industry should be included in this cluster. Peat has its own part to play in forest-based industries, particularly in the Nordic countries and in Ireland. The report does not adopt a position on whether peat is a renewable or a fossil fuel. However, as it is produced industrially, these producers must have their place in EU administration. In the opinion of the rapporteur, the report contains an unnecessary number of additional conclusions relating to forestry, but it was the wish of the committee, although Parliament has already expressed its view on forestry matters in the recent Thomas report. Nothing more needs to be added; instead, its conclusions should be put into effect in the Commission in a more proactive way than is the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also carefully study the conclusions of Mr Pesälä, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The forestry cluster represents the open sector of the economy, where the activity is conducted in globally competing markets. For that reason, I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by my colleagues, Mrs Schierhuber and Mr Rübig, that the Directorate-General on Agriculture should be responsible for forestry. Agriculture in the EU is not accustomed to working in accordance with the conditions of the open sector. The same problem also relates to Mrs Ainardi’s proposed amendment. Mrs Flesch’s amendment, in my opinion, is taken account of in the text adopted by the committee and not least on the basis of her own amendments. The special needs of the content industry are dealt with thoroughly in my report, and, for that reason, I do not think this amendment is necessary at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Wood is a renewable natural resource. It has many uses; for example, it can be used in the energy industry. The report accepts the principle according to which forestry products should be used for the production of energy only at the end of the production chain, after which there is no longer any other use for it and it cannot be recycled. Member States are the best experts when it comes to managing their own forests. The multipurpose utilisation of forests, their importance as sinks of carbon dioxide, and their preservation for future generations will be best realised though the application of the principle of subsidiarity, and there is no justification for increasing the Commission's powers in forestry matters. Instead, it has an important job to do, safeguarding the competitiveness of forest-based industries. The needs of the forestry industry must also be taken into account in commercial policy. The European forestry cluster will succeed amid fierce competition if the rules are the same for all. If the over-exploitation of nature and people is not allowed in Europe, it should not be allowed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The diverse utilisation of wood can improve employment, especially in rural areas, and, consequently, forests also connect with the EU’s employment strategy. Science and research must find new uses for wood. For example, using grass to make chemical pulp would mean more wood for other purposes. Such ideas must be promoted within a new Framework Programme of research. Wood can be used more in construction, as an environmentally friendly and healthy material. And finally: if the forests do well, so will people.</p>

The Commission has drafted a creditable communication on the state of global competitiveness in the forestry industry. This document has meant that forestry matters have been made the subject of very necessary debate in the EU, which, unfortunately, happens all too rarely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is mainly satisfied with the policies set forth by the Commission and Parliament’s draft report. We would like to stress the importance of the whole forestry chain in our own opinion, and that includes the importance of the profitability of forestry and wood harvesting, which is responsible for the raw material base of the forestry industry. Sustainable agriculture in Europe still depends on the family forest businesses practised by twelve million private forest owners and the activities they are engaged in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Convention on World Climate Change failed. We, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have followed the climate agreement process actively, as, in our opinion, the Kyoto Protocol takes totally insufficient account of the importance of forests. Forests and all wood products are a considerable carbon sink, and their importance in this respect has to be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">The coordination of matters of forestry in the EU is poor. There are more Directorates-General to deal with them but there is a lack of uniformity. Personnel resources have been increased in the area of the environment, but the Directorate-General on Agriculture responsible for forestry has very few resources to work with, as does that for industry. For that reason, I support Amendment No 1 by Mrs Schierhuber on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. Likewise I want to show my support for Amendments Nos 3 and 4 in particular, which are from the opinion by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Our committee approved them by general consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have an interest in a forestry business in New Zealand, inherited from my father, so that gives me a practical interest. More recently I visited Finland to see the forestry industry at work as the guest of CEPI, the Confederation of European Paper Industries. So you see the strong Finnish theme in this report continues even with me.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I welcome this communication and express my pleasure at its emphasis on the importance of this industry. Like the rapporteur and other colleagues I recognise that forestry is a very important industry, important for the economy and important for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. In itself it has made quite a contribution towards the consumption of paper and this is to be welcomed, even if our colleagues on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy had to make it a little bit longer than he would wish. Better to say too much about forestry than too little.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with interest his reference to telecommunications and the changes in the shape of the communication industry. I happen to believe that despite all these wonderful aspects of modern technology, we will continue to need paper for our reading, because it is the medium that most people are still comfortable with and I certainly am. Also, of course, we shall continue to need timber for all the other uses to which it is put, such as in construction and other possible new uses. The rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture draw attention to the potential for research into new uses of timber.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I sound one note of warning. It is a little unrealistic to ask the Commission to ensure that paper prices in Europe are competitive. I think that might be stretching the Commissioner's powers a little bit. I see he is smiling so perhaps he agrees with me.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place. That is the key issue here, rather than trying to favour our industry. This is a valuable, sustainable industry, very important to the economy of Europe and to our environment, and this is a very timely report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One third of our land area is covered in forest, and if you include our neighbours to the east in the picture, there is still more forest. Forest-based industry actually employs two and a half million people, which is no insignificant matter, and, as we know, accounts for a tenth of industrial output.</p>
<p class="contents">When we calculate the amount of carbon that is sequestered in forests I think we also have to take into account the stands of forest stock that were grown and tended prior to 1990. Otherwise, this work of many decades will not be taken into account when the effect of greenhouse gases is calculated. And so it is that we are rewarding just those who have destroyed their forests and are now hurriedly trying to do some planting, while they have first and foremost been destroying them for centuries. They who have tended their forests properly for decades, lived off forestry and know this delicate balance, would be penalised, because there are Member States in which people no longer have anywhere to plant a tree, unless they start planting them on their own roofs. For this reason, paragraph 17 in this report is very important. Forests and seas are among the most important carbon sinks and stores, and it has also been seen that the ability of forest soil in the north to absorb carbon is even greater than that of trees. But, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is such that we cannot grow seas: of the two we can only grow forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Forests create peace. That is becoming an ever greater factor when it comes to contentment – I think it is fine for Nintendo – and it creates ecological balance. A dead tree is sympathetic, and you can lean against it, whether it is warm or cold; you can only lean against a rock when it is warm. The use of wood is thus cause for diversification, and especially now, when we are at the stage where communication is moving further away from paper, which is wood-based. I would propose that the Commission should annex to some appropriate document a set of ideas for the multipurpose use of wood, as we are now on the crest of a wave with regard to wood-based production. Now the basis of the activity is changing and the focus is on new approaches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the Commission deserves thanks for a new type of communication, in which a field of industry has been comprehensively examined from the point of view of global competitiveness. The report is comprehensive in its present form. During the Portuguese Presidency an additional objective was added to it at the committee stage: that the EU should be the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy in the forestry sector also.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the views set forth in the report and most of the amendments to it. We ourselves are tabling a few amendments, which we ask you to support. I would in particular like to mention Amendment No 3, which raises the question of the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. When it is at its best, the forestry sector can serve as a model for other sectors regarding how renewable natural resources can be exploited, how carbon from the atmosphere binds in products and how the materials supply chain works in an environmentally sustainable, yet, at the same time, economically profitable, way. In this sense, the importance of construction with wood should be highlighted more obviously.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to recognise the importance of forestry for less developed areas, and especially for rural areas in difficulties. This importance is particular evident in the area of employment. The Union should work more effectively in the future to develop small businesses that use raw timber, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commission's communication is rather a hodgepodge which lumps together willy-nilly the publishing industry which is knowledge-based and content-focused with primary forestry industries and also paper production. The publishing industry is both unhappy and bemused, to say the least, and this is not how we promote the European Union nor how things work in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The publishing industry feels that there is a lack of recognition of its particular requirements with regard to the expanding IT sector. The Commission could be open to the accusation, indeed, that perhaps it prefers an IT sector devoid of content. I would recommend, Commissioner, that you look seriously at this question and review this whole division of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also take issue with the report's paragraph 2: peat is not a wood substitute, it is a fuel/fertiliser in its own right. I know there are particular Irish and Finnish interests here, but I do not believe that we can accept peat as a forest-based industry. It is a completely separate fuel sector which has also fertiliser as a component.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change: the rapporteur makes some interesting comments here. I agree with him that we should urgently implement the Kyoto Agreement. That is what we all want to do. Forests are, of course, important storages of C02 but the potential for expansion of forests in the EU is limited, even if welcome. However, I fail to understand the reference to the oceans. We have had oceans since time immemorial, and this has nothing to do with our present problems with climate change, so I agree with my other colleagues and cannot see what possible relevance that paragraph has.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the paper industry: it should clean up its bad former record on the pollution of the environment, and it is also important to inquire into the difficulties of monopolies in the paper sector, particularly with regard to cartels in the recycling sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European agriculture will always remain critical to the well-being of European rural economies – indeed, it represents the main option for economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, production controls ensure that many farmers cannot increase their income from farming and, therefore, alternative income-generating opportunities from off-farm activities are vital if rural populations are to benefit from economic growth. We have seen the success of rural development programmes, including the LEADER scheme and other such activities which have helped create much needed employment in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas throughout Europe. However, the option to engage in forestry activity can also be a very constructive and environmentally friendly mechanism for farmers to increase their existing income.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Irish government's national development plan for 2000-2006, a total of IEP 580m is being provided for forestry activities. This would be cofunded under the common agricultural rural development programme. This latter investment will support a planting programme in Ireland of over 20 000 ha per year over the period of the plan. The focus will be for on-farm forestry, with grants, planting and maintenance, as well as income-support premium. In addition to CAP support and measures, an allocation of IEP 80m has been provided in the regional operational programme for investment in harvesting equipment, forest roads and general woodland improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the EU operational programme for forestry and the generous funding available for afforestation, it is imperative that the end product of this investment is a quality, sustainable forest product, one capable of yielding over time a return both for the individual farmer and the community.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the relative resilience of trees to survive, the necessary silvacultural practices could be neglected in the early years of establishment of new forests. This must be avoided if the European sector is to meet the challenge of quality and competitiveness in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On a broader perspective, Parliament should be aware of the serious threat to the world's tropical forests, which are diminishing by 15 million hectares annually. Not sufficient research is being done on the growing of tropical hardwoods. In this regard, we should be aware of the work of the European Forest Institute and its encouragement and research into the planting of new tropical forests. If we are to address the need for sustainability, we must tackle these problems very early on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore welcome this broadened approach to industrial policy and the Community forestry strategy. To talk of competitiveness at a time of keen worldwide competition, the challenges involved in the enlargement and restructuring of the rural world whilst acknowledging the diversity and the multi-functionality of the forest is, of course, a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel bound to inform Mr Seppänen that I was rather disappointed by his report, which seems to me to take a somewhat simplistic approach towards the competitiveness of the wood industry. I get the regrettable impression that he sees forests exclusively as industrial production units based on intensive single-crop farming necessitating a revolution every thirty years.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning from Finland, where I witnessed precisely this kind of intensive cultivation, which it is absolutely crucial to the paper industry to promote, I nevertheless think, Mr Seppänen, that the wealth of Europe resides specifically in its diversity. While I may be convinced of the validity of this approach to cultivating the Nordic forests, I think the report should have taken account of forests where biodiversity subsists, for example in France, as well as industries other than paper industries. It seems to me that there was a tendency to forget everything to do with timber and other wood-based construction materials made in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we will support this report as its approach is quite significant, as well as the excellent amendments tabled by our colleagues, except for Amendment No 5, which seems to us irrelevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to remind you about both environmental aspects and eco-social and economic aspects. As a raw material, wood is the most important renewable energy source in Europe, and no one should underestimate the importance in regional policy terms of small and medium-sized businesses in the wood industry and in forestry as providers of jobs in rural areas. This sector is a key factor in a multifunctional agricultural and forestry industry. Together, the forestry and wood industries provide millions of jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A sustainable forestry industry can make a substantial contribution to climate protection and to achieving the Kyoto objectives. Globally speaking, we must protect our forests in order to defend ourselves against disasters. I am therefore very grateful to the previous speaker for her comments. I would particularly like to draw attention to protected forests and virgin forests in the Alps.</p>
<p class="contents">Appropriate proposals for the construction industry need to be pursued. The use of wood and wood products in the building industry should be promoted, and wood should increasingly be used instead of other construction materials. A further advantage of wood is that it involves fixing large quantities of CO2 over long periods. I therefore support the approach of using targeted marketing and advertising measures for wood products to raise public awareness. We need to provide information and advice about the advantages of these products throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not advocating a Community forestry policy, but rather a common forestry strategy for Europe, with the Commission playing a proper coordinating role. The various aspects of forest-based and related industries should be coordinated within a single directorate-general, and it would make sense for this to be the directorate-general for agriculture, which would also need to be adequately staffed to cope with the wide variety of tasks involved. Without forestry there can be no wood industry. So I hope that the House will accept this logic and vote for Amendments Nos 1 and 2.</p>

This report on the forest-based and related industries covers just about every important area imaginable, and very much of what it says is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would still like to comment on a couple of points. First, I think what is missing here is a reference to the dramatic developments in this sector as regards mergers and acquisitions. This particularly applies to the paper industry at present, where more and more companies are merging because they believe this is essential if they are to remain competitive. My fear is that Europe, which I hope will itself be growing together, will increasingly be faced with circumstances comparable with those in Canada and other countries, where the pressure which companies are coming under is simply passed on to their forests, which are being exploited in the most brutal way. I therefore hope that the Commission will bring forward appropriate and clear proposals, if at all possible in the form of directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the environment, we should not fool ourselves. Nine years after Rio we are still a long way from being able to meaningfully implement what was agreed there in terms of sustainability. In the long run, we will probably have to prepare for our northern forests to absorb what the tropical forests of the Third World cannot, for whatever reasons. So in future forests will above all be very greatly involved in environmental protection, which brings me to my third point, that is to say the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally very much hope that the idea of the paperless office and perhaps even of a paperless Parliament, by virtue of the Internet, will not just give rise to quiet smiles but actually become a reality. Although this would have a corresponding impact on jobs in the industry, it would make sense environmentally speaking. That is my last point.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, this report creates a negative impression. It relates too much to existing industries, and it rather gives the impression of trying to protect something that really can no longer be protected. We only have to remember what happened to the steel industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it makes sense to subsidise this sector. But the idea of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises which is contained in Amendment No 3 is very positive. It is also extremely important for us to consider the issue of cartels, given the most recent trends in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wood regrows, it rots and finds its way back into the natural cycle from which it came. So we should not forget wood in the Sixth Framework Programme on Research – we should make sure that the priority area for wood is accordingly drawn up with due care, especially in the field of biotechnology. I believe that wood will be a lot more important for us in the future than it has been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">As wood is also very widely used in the international construction industry, the wood industry faces numerous problems. It has to deal with a huge number of technical trade barriers, a multiplicity of national standards and authorisation procedures and also, to some extent, bureaucratic testing, monitoring and certification requirements. This is an area where the European Commission should apply SLIM. And perhaps the wood sector is an ideal one for introducing model procedures, possibly including BEST.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Hans-Peter Martin, as promoting small and medium-sized enterprises is, of course, a central and essential matter, and one where we have an important partner in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also the matter of making appropriate changes to building laws and regulations, because fire regulations in Europe in particular vary widely. We believe it is high time that the construction products directive was adopted. This directive in particular would enable great progress to be made in marketing wood.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards world trade, I would like to stress that Japan has very restrictive legislation in this area. This is something we also need to discuss because wood is, after all, not just a raw material and a construction material, but it will also be highly important in future through biotechnology. That is why we especially want to promote smaller biomass power stations, which will make an important contribution to Europe's energy self-sufficiency, so that this is also an area where wood has an important role to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I am especially encouraged by how the report has managed to take account of ecological and even partly socio-economic conditions in the industry, active, as it is, in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself wish to raise the issue of peat, which is dealt with in the second paragraph of the report. The report calls for the inclusion of the peat industry in the forest cluster. This is most justified. It will support many aims of the energy policy which the EU is trying to drive through, and which it has just mentioned in the Green Paper on energy. Peat will reinforce the situation regarding our self-sufficiency in energy and its guaranteed supply, which, alarmingly, are in decline; and it will promote the combined production of electricity and heat, and bring with it the synergic benefit of the use of wood and peat for energy. Given that peat growth is on a year-to-year basis, it is clearly also a renewable energy source. Moreover, peat has many regionally positive effects that favour employment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, peat should be compared to wood rather than carbon, for example, which is now how it is classed by the EU, going against what is factually correct. The renewability of peat is an incontestable biological fact. Peat grows continually through the assimilation of bog plants and the production of forest litter. Its origin is in principle exactly the same as that of other biomasses that derive from plants, for example wood. The time necessary for the process is longer, however. According to a new, impartial scientific report, peat should be distinguished from fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form. Owing to its origin and essentially renewable nature, peat must be classified as a biomass fuel, but because it regrows substantially more slowly than other plants, a new, third category should be established and placed between fossil fuels and energy sources whose renewability rate is fast. Peat is a biomass fuel with a slow renewability rate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that burning peat, as with wood fuel, produces greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The Kyoto agreement does not include emissions from burning wood in the overall emissions burden, as the carbon that is sequestered in wood would be released in any case when the wood decays. Furthermore, studies on carbon levels and gas circulation in peatlands have come out in recent years and their results show it would be desirable to have a re-evaluation of peat fuel emissions which took account of gas levels in bogs as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of peat it is worth reminding ourselves of scale. The area devoted to energy use is very small compared to the areas of marshland used in forestry and agriculture. The peat harvest accounts for less than one per mil of the total area of northern peatlands. Nevertheless, the economic exploitation of peat is important in those areas where there is a lot of marshland. For example, in Finland we use less than half the annual growth of peat each year. We therefore do not touch the capital, because the interest is enough to get by on.</p>
<p class="contents">The report urges the Commission to strengthen the coordination and coherence of Community sectorial action having an impact on forest clusters, in order to improve competitiveness. This need for coordination and coherence would in particular appear to apply to peat, and one important step on the road would be to change the way it is classified and its status, to correspond with its true nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all I would like to shed a little light in just a few words on how important this sector of industry is. It accounts for 10% of all industrial output in the EU, whether measured in terms of value added or number of jobs. It is worth remembering that a total of 12 million private forest owners supply wood to industry, and the sector is represented everywhere in the EU. The industry is often located in remote regions, where it helps to maintain economic activity, levels of employment and the infrastructure. Five main areas of the industry form one of the biggest industrial sectors in the European Union. The value of its output stands at more than EUR 300 billion, its value added at EUR 110 billion. It gives direct employment to 2.5 million people, and indirectly the figure is much larger than that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission communication the state of competitiveness in the forest industry and industries related to it was examined by viewing the sector in a new way, as a cluster, in which each sector’s performance affects the competitiveness of the other sectors. In such an examination by groups any analysis of individual areas may be overlooked, but questions can be examined from a broader viewpoint. The communication offers a basis for the future evaluation of factors having an impact on competitiveness in this industry. That is why the Commission has made a series of sectorial studies of the forest industry and industries related to it. Studies on the printing and mechanised industries have already been published. In addition, the Commission has established, as an extension to the communication in hand, two channels for debate. One is an advisory committee on forestry and forest-based industries, whose work got under way again in 1997, and the other is a forum for forest and related industries. This forum plays a major role, as it makes it possible to systematically analyse essential questions and interact effectively with companies, industrial organisations and other interested parties. Representatives from the Community’s institutions, such as Parliament and the Commission, as well as the Member States also participate in the forum.</p>
<p class="contents">The first forum was held here in Strasbourg at the beginning of September, it was made up of people of authority, and I might mention that the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, was also present. There were also discussions about publishing, which Mrs Flesch mentioned: <span class="italic">e</span>commerce and industrial and intellectual property rights were discussed. The next forum is to be held in Stockholm in June. That will focus on a closer look at how forest-based and related industries can, for their part, promote sustainable development and optimise their contribution to the protection of the environment at all stages of the production chain from forestry itself right up to the end products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming ever more important to take account of sustainable development. In June we shall be holding the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg, at which important decisions will be taken in this area. Forest-based industries are those in which all the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development are closely dependent on one another. Forest-based industries use renewable raw material and the most up-to-date recycling and energy-saving methods, so its contribution may well be especially important for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Flesch’s question I would say this: we understand very well that publishing today differs from the forestry industry proper, and involves production based on paper just as much as many other industries. The problem for the Commission has been that the resources of the Directorate-General for Enterprise have fallen by 20% over the last year. We have lost 210 staff in all. We have had to combine departments and offices. I am nevertheless prepared to take this matter up now as a subject for discussion again, mainly with a mind to looking at in which sector or in connection with which sector publishing would best be placed. I will be in contact with representatives of the industry after this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I wish to thank Mr Seppänen for an excellent report and the other members for their contribution to this work.</p>

We are continually having to postpone the discussion of reports. I think this is related to the fact that we are not managing our time well enough and that we should perhaps also change and reassess a number of ways in which the House operates. I believe, however, that cutting the part-session to four days is the main reason for all these departures from the agenda. If we cut the plenary part-session working time to three and a half days, the next thing we shall be down to two days. What is the point of the European Parliament? It is up to all the Members of the House to show how serious they are in their work, in line with the commitments they have made as Members of Parliament. This is the issue being raised again.</p>
