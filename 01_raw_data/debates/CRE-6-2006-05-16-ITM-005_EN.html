<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to present to you the proposal for a regulation on the Marco Polo II programme. This regulation is the successor to Marco Polo I, which was adopted in 2003, and has the same objectives. The new programme, like the old one, aims to reduce congestion on the road network, to improve the environmental performance of the transport system, and to strengthen intermodal transport in order to contribute to the implementation of an effective and sustainable transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will run from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, and will have a budget of EUR 400 million, which is higher than that for Marco Polo I. The programme is structured around the granting of direct subsidies to companies to launch intermodal services; it is the most efficient way of providing public funding. This programme was designed, in the impact assessment, such that one euro of subsidy granted under Marco Polo II will generate more than six euros in terms of social and environmental benefits for society.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is based on the mechanisms of the current programme, the regulation provides for two new types of action: those relating to motorways of the sea and those relating to traffic avoidance. These actions should help to reduce the volume of international road freight, and thus respond to the strong expectations of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo II programme incorporates the concept of motorways of the sea, which has also been incorporated into the framework of the trans-European networks. It puts forward objectives that are appropriate to services related to these motorways of the sea. The calls for proposals between Germany and Finland, and between France and Spain, are now in progress. The actions related to the motorways of the sea aim to reduce road traffic in a specific corridor. This clearly visible Community added value will be of benefit to European citizens and, due to that, it deserves a Community contribution based on projects planned by consortia involving shippers, transport operators and infrastructure providers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to get the production sector and logistics systems more actively involved in a coherent sustainable development strategy. That is why the Commission has also provided for traffic avoidance actions. The industry has already taken an interest in this problem, in order to rationalise its supply chains and to reduce distribution and transport costs. Thus, we can see that the measures to improve industrial efficiency and the political will to reduce the negative effects of transport simply by trying to avoid it serve the same interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Marco Polo II also extends the scope of the programme to include all of the European Union's neighbours. Today, Europe as a whole, and not only the Union of 25 Member States, will find itself at the spearhead of an integrated transport market. Our neighbours to the East - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Balkans - and those in the Mediterranean region form part of a huge integrated market for transport services. Production and the characteristics of the supply chain do not stop at the borders of the 25 Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council agreed on a partial general approach on 21 April 2005. I am delighted that the rapporteur and Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism have tried to achieve agreement at first reading. This constructive approach taken by the two institutions should enable us to adopt the regulation quickly and to launch an initial call for tenders under Marco Polo II. I should like to thank you, Mr Rack, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism of which you are the chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the compromise that has been reached, four points are worth emphasising: aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, the funding thresholds for the various actions, the possible impact of traffic avoidance actions and the particular attention paid to sensitive and metropolitan areas. Parliament was quite right to underline the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises have in accessing this programme, and the new text will quite specifically make it easier for them. I am grateful to Mr Rack for stressing this point. The minimum subsidy thresholds for the various types of action have been reduced in comparison with those proposed by the Commission, and we will look into how we can deal with the increase in assessment and monitoring work that will result. I believe that the fear that the traffic avoidance measures could potentially have a negative effect on employment and cohesion in certain regions has been satisfactorily addressed. The new regulation also aims to give greater attention to sensitive and metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I apologise for taking such a long time in explaining this proposal. I should like to repeat how happy I am that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach to this report, with the result that, in my opinion, today's text is most satisfactory. I should like to thank you all, in particular the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Vice-President Barrot has already described in detail what Marco Polo II is intended to achieve, and so I can, quite deliberately, keep this brief. In essence, the object is to continue the old programme, but with added value in two respects, in that a great deal more money will be available for Marco Polo II than was for Marco Polo I, and so we will have the chance of even greater success than before in moving traffic onto environmentally safer modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have not managed to get the 47 million on which we originally set our sights, I do believe that the compromise – which had to be reached within the limits of the general financial perspective – does show that the Commission, like the other two institutions, the Council and Parliament, regards Marco Polo as an important programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Another ‘plus’ is that we have taken quite deliberate account in the programme of the expansion of Marco Polo I in response to new and changing circumstances. We are working on the assumption that all the EU’s neighbours to the East, as well as those around the Mediterranean, are meant to enjoy the benefits of Marco Polo II, since it makes sense to intercept traffic, and transfer it to environmentally safer modes of transport, as near as possible to the point from which it started out.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may keep to the analogy with the wheel, we have also given the actions a slight ‘spin’ by adding two new ones – the motorways of the sea, about which the Commissioner has already spoken in detail, and traffic avoidance, although it has to be said that we have had very intensive discussions among ourselves about how this issue might be better addressed. The Vice-President has already pointed out that the object cannot be to use European funds to move jobs around within the EU or out of it, and quite possibly in large numbers; the measures we are proposing must not have that effect and are not meant to.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo II programme has, then, in essence had an advance green light from all three institutions, and that has prompted us to make the attempt to complete this legislative project as early as first reading and have it ready for use, and it is thanks to a great deal of willingness on the part of the Commission in particular, but also of the Council of Transport Ministers, that we have succeeded in this. In the ordinary way of things, the Transport Committee does not regard the Council as a partner with whom it has had a long and affectionate relationship, but we have, in this specific instance, managed to work together very constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">This House regarded the Marco Polo II draft as already satisfactory and saw little need to make any fundamental alteration to it. We in this House saw it as important that we should ensure better opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, or at least opportunities equal to those that Marco Polo projects gave them. We have put forward a number of what I hope are sensible proposals, which have to do, in particular, with reductions in the threshold values applicable to the original Marco Polo I objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for all of us to give what we have worked on tangible form, to foster greater efficiency and cut down on red tape. With this project we are sending out a proper and vital message, and I would like, in conclusion to thank all involved – the Commission, the Council and my fellow-Members of this House – for their constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is something technical to be considered: because we wanted to wrap this up at first reading, we had to ensure that the two documents – from the Council and from Parliament – were technically compatible. There is still work for the lawyer-linguists in both services to do on this, and for that I ask the House’s indulgence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new Marco Polo II programme provides many opportunities in this direction. It extends to our entire neighbourhood, as far as Russia and our Mediterranean partner states, it provides opportunities for maritime transport by creating a separate category of actions, motorways of the sea, and it promotes the rationalisation of international transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Commissioner, for the decisiveness with which you worked on the conception and structure of the programme. My congratulations in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Rack, because his proposals strengthen the added value which the programme gives to the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union and its neighbours. It gives new room for intervention in small- and medium-sized enterprises, something in which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has often expressed an interest. Mr Rack also intervenes in promoting and strengthening the balance between transport efficiency, reductions in costs, pollution and road traffic, thus contributing to the objective of drastically reducing accidents, which is a primary objective of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the development of motorways of the sea will constitute a dynamic element in our planning and in the efficacy of our objectives. The sea is a force and capital that has not yet been developed in our policy and we must work in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I thank the rapporteur because, with his proper handling and negotiations with the Council, he made it possible for us to have an acceptable text which we believe will quickly be put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I really am, then, most grateful for your trust.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, the European transport system will face major challenges over the next few years, and they need to be addressed right now. It is to be expected that there will be an increase in traffic of up to 60%, along with the predictable consequences in the shape of traffic jams, damage to the environment, accidents and the risk of a loss of competitiveness on the part of European industry. The Marco Polo II programme is, in this respect, certainly capable of meeting the requirements of business and industry on the one hand, but also those of the environmentalists on the other, meeting the needs of the environment and all that is associated with that; that is one reason why I was very glad that it was possible relatively quickly to draft an extended and adapted Marco Polo programme.</p>
<p class="contents">There were of course positive and negative aspects to this. One negative aspect is the budget, which, having originally been quite generous, was then reduced to EUR 400 million, which is particularly disappointing when one considers the cuts that will have to be made right across the transport sector, and it appears that the EU has set itself the wrong priorities where the figures in the budget are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of what can be said about Marco Polo II is, however, encouraging; it is in those terms that one can describe the reduction in the minimum grant thresholds, since the programme did not previously apply to small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also important that the programme covers one aspect in particular, namely the shift onto rails and the modernisation of rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regard it as a particular breakthrough that, in contrast to the former Marco Polo programme, it is not only the tonnage that counts, but that, for the first time, the volume can be taken into account as well. This amounts to a considerable step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it particularly significant that the text addresses the jobs issue and that we have taken the initiative on this front too. I now look forward with eager anticipation to see how this turns out in practice and hope that the programme will be a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the congestion that this is going to cause, it will have a major impact on our environment: what we call ‘external costs’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission estimates that, for every euro spent on this programme, six euros will be saved on these external costs. We are not, therefore, happy about the cuts made in the 2007-2013 financial perspective to the budget of EUR 740 million requested by the Commission for this programme for the next seven-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to support the proposal and the compromise amendments achieved as a result of considerable efforts by Mr Rack, but we would have liked projects to have been eligible for subsidy if they would have brought about a net reduction in road congestion, whether or not they transferred goods to other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also have liked to have achieved even lower minimum thresholds for the indicative amounts per euro of subsidy, so that a greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises might have accessed the aid from the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we welcome the fact that the criterion of the volume of the cargo has been taken into account when evaluating the results of the measures that are subsidised, because it is not the weight of the goods themselves that pollutes and causes congestion, but the volume that they occupy, and consequently and definitively the number of lorries that are needed to transport them.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the fact that measures carried out in only one Member State are accepted as eligible for subsidy, provided that they represent at least a 50% improvement in cross border traffic with other States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as I do not wish to go on for too long, I would like to reflect on something, although this might be part of a different proposal: we believe that there also needs to be a discussion regarding our current model of production and subsequent distribution of goods. If we were really incorporating all the external costs of transport without exception, as well as the repercussions of that model on the distribution of the population and land planning, we might have to change the model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was because we hoped that one result of the negotiations might yet be the extension of the programme that we did not immediately give our assent to everything. The hope may have been there, but it was, unfortunately, not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say quite frankly that the halving of the figures originally proposed was, in my view, a setback, but the programme itself has come out of the evaluation in a positive light, and it is for that reason that we will – as we must – support it. The fact is that Marco Polo, as a programme, had the potential to – and indeed does – play a core role in addressing the problems to which transport gives rise, and would not only actively help improve modal shift, but also boost intermodal transport, for, this time, the focus is on inland waterways and on short-distance sea transport – which I will not call ‘motorways of the sea’, since that always strikes me as a rather peculiar term – and we have had to accept that certain switches from one mode of transport to another are made impossible by the absence of key points and interconnection points between them. I regard intervention in this area as crucial and important.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme would also send out a message to the general population, who suffer from the adverse effects of goods transport by road, such as emissions, noise, and the other hazards to health and the environment that people talk about, which they regard as tragic and which they wish to reduce. It is for that reason that this programme is so important to me right now. It has, unfortunately, appeared to us from some interventions by representatives of the Commission that consideration is being given, in the course of the mid-term review of the White Paper, to regarding the switching of transport to environmentally friendly modes of transport as no longer an objective of the European Union, and that I would regard as absolutely the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">If we regard the protection of the environment and public health as things to be aimed at, then what is needed is not just a programme costing EUR 400 million, but rather the sort of focused determination that intervenes and says clearly that transport cannot simply be allowed to trundle along as it is doing, but must be guided – which it now is being, albeit in the wrong direction. If the mid-term review really does entail the abandonment of the ‘modal shift’ change, we will lose credibility in the eyes of the public. Merely giving way to the interventions of the most powerful lobbyists and forgetting the interests of the people who live along roads constitutes an abandonment of policymaking; such a thing is no longer worthy of the name, for it amounts to nothing more than allowing the economic interests of a small economic sector to prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The White Paper on Transport is right to mention the shift of freight transport from the road to rail and inland shipping as an important objective. Even after the forthcoming update of the White Paper, this should remain a priority, because without a modal shift, our transport cannot meet the demands of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that, since the financial wings of Marco Polo II, which is to run up until 2013, have been drastically clipped by a reduction from EUR 740 million to EUR 400 million, this objective may not be achieved as effectively or on time. Despite this, my group remains of the opinion that the present programme is of huge importance in order to improve the environment and to curb the growth in road transport that has got completely out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is in favour of extending the programme to include the European Union’s neighbouring countries and also the extra attention for shifting more of the freight that is being carried along coastal roads to the Motorways of the Sea. At least as important is the reduction of unnecessary transport by achieving better logistical harmonisation. The number of miles driven can be reduced by preventing empty runs, by shortening the distances between the different processing stages as much as possible and by higher loading factors. We have always argued in favour of the principle of transport prevention that was introduced here. The lowering of the subsidy thresholds will produce additional red tape. Whilst the proposed volume equivalents are a positive addition to the calculation of saved tonnage miles, the 1 on 1 coefficient that was given for this could lead to a situation in which from hereon in, all applications are submitted in volume units, because this is more profitable for business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The only fundamental observation I should like to make with regard to this programme is that there is no assessment of Marco Polo I. The lack of such an evaluation means that it is impossible to say whether Marco Polo II will have the desired effect, simply because the link between goal and resources used is unknown.

<p class="contents">As a French Member of the European Parliament, and in view of the geographical position of France as a real crossroads in the European road network, I fully support all the initiatives aimed at reducing congestion on our roads, at promoting ways of transporting goods and persons other than by road and at improving the environmental performance of the transport system in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted at the position given to motorways of the sea in the Marco Polo II programme, as the development of these motorways will have a positive influence on reducing international road freight. As the rapporteur stressed, if nothing is done to reduce congestion on the roads, goods transport by road will increase overall by more than 60% by 2013. We will be faced with an increasing number of accidents, with greater congestion, with more environmental damage and, ultimately, with higher costs for European industry as a whole, which, to the extent that it depends on reliable and profitable supply chains, will become less competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must focus all of our efforts on developing intermodal transport. With the enlargement to the East, Europe's maritime borders have been pushed back, and we now have new conditions and opportunities for developing the motorways of the sea.

This success is due to much perseverance on his part, so let us count our blessings. Despite the on-going ups and downs surrounding the financial perspectives, an amount to the tune of EUR 400 million is available for this new Marco Polo programme, which is double the amount that has so far been available annually.</p>
<p class="contents">All credit to the Commission for extending the scope of Marco Polo II in its proposal to include motorways of the sea actions and a reduction in transport, and also for the fact that there are more opportunities for inland shipping, so that a whole range of alternative and environmentally-friendly modes of transport can help promote the modal shift via this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament, in its negotiations with the Council, has managed to carry out a number of important improvements in the proposed programme, the most important of which is a substantial reduction in the thresholds for awarding support, which, in many cases, have been reduced by half, for in practice, it still proves difficult for small enterprises to use this programme. I am also pleased that inland shipping has been given a more important position than in the original proposal. Thirdly, it is a good thing that public bodies, including regional and local governments, can also take part in consortiums. This too can give small enterprises a helping hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has pledged to look into the possibility of awarding support to small infrastructure projects for the benefit of modal shift actions. Minor improvements, such as building quay walls, can be decisive in the success of those modal-shift actions. That is why I would like to ask you if you can inform us of the results of the study and whether you will actually include this possibility of small infrastructural projects in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end on a practical note. The Commission, in its policy programme, has given priority to the reduction of the administrative burden and an improvement of rules and regulations. Practice, however, has shown that those who submit projects are asked to submit such elaborate details that very often, they do not even know where to start. I hope that in this respect too, the changes that have been made by Parliament via the rapporteur will lead to an improvement and can encourage enterprises. I would ask you to keep the finger on the pulse, though, because your services will need to be accessible and accommodating to those who want to apply for projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is to be seen in a positive light is that the programme is markedly better funded and equipped than its predecessors, ranging from PACT 1 to Marco Polo 1, but it has to be said that its funding and equipment are not going to be equal to the challenge of modal shift, and that is why we need, first of all, to be vigilant in ensuring that the projects are, firstly, genuinely cross-border in nature, so as to ensure an added value for Europe, and, secondly, in ensuring that the reduction by half of the minimum threshold values for grants really does put SMEs in a stronger position and increase their share. Thirdly, more inland waterway transport projects must be completed than have been in the past, and, fourthly, those national programmes that are either already in place or needed for the future must, at long last, be coordinated. Fifthly, attention should be paid to reviewing the instruments’ sustainability, which will involve the Commission in evaluating which projects are still operational after a period of between six and ten years, with the Commission – sixthly – reviewing which of the rejected projects are completed even without support, so that the induced effects of future programmes may be minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rack's report is, overall, uncontentious, and should be implemented as policy with the greatest possible speed; the added value of these measures will be immediately visible to the public, and that is something for which time is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free and fair competition is leading us into disaster. We have before us a proposal to develop the motorways of the sea, rail and intermodality and to help industrial and non-industrial SMEs. In parallel to this, however, the Commission is continuing its crusade to privatise the railways, without even reviewing ten disastrous years. This direction is the right one to take, but there are not enough resources to make it credible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group is calling for a separate vote on Mr Rack's report and on the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. We will be voting against this opinion, because it can be summed up as 'tell me what you are missing, and I will tell you how to do without it'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore the duty of the legislator to promote alternative and more environmentally-friendly modes of transport and, above all, to better integrate intermodal transport and to make it as functional as possible, for the purposes of both safety and quality of life, while of course seeking to mitigate the demands of the economy. In this regard, Mr Rack's excellent report presents timely proposals for the Marco Polo II programme, which I hope the budget allocation will make it possible to subsequently carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">The party that I represent, the <span class="italic">Fiamma Tricolore</span>, has always supported the idea of the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, which Italy itself designed for the Mediterranean as far back as the first half of the last century; such motorways are rightly taken into consideration and relaunched in the Rack report as part of the Marco Polo II programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I clearly support – and I call on my fellow Members to do the same – Mr Rack’s amendments, which are aimed at revising the Marco Polo II programme for the purposes of reducing the administrative formalities required for intermodal transport. I believe that this is an excellent report, which I hope will gain the support of Parliament as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that his objective and that of most Members who contributed to the debate in committee was to address the need, above all, to rebalance the distribution of means of transport in a sustainable manner and to develop intermodality, addressing the congestion problem with efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no other way to combat the anticipated increase in road freight transport, which is forecast to reach over 60% by 2013 in the EU alone. That being said, the excessive transport of freight on our roads is simply the most visible problem. Its costs in economic, security and environmental terms are huge. It is therefore essential to take consistent measures to offset these negative effects. Reducing road freight transport and transforming intermodality into a competitive and economically viable reality is the right way forward if we are to reverse the current trend.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, and fine-tuning the previous programme, Marco Polo II contains a broader and more complete range of necessary and welcome incentives and measures, which will be applicable not only on EU territory but also in neighbouring regions, and this is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">It will make it possible to boost investment in rail transport, inland navigation and in the use of motorways of the sea more effectively, making use of European maritime islands and the outermost regions as thoroughfares between those routes – the motorways and inland navigation. It is also vital to promote the development of technical innovations that could bring competitive benefits for alternative modes of transport, especially as regards trailing loads. The objective of reducing international road transport, especially that of freight, implies pushing to the fore projects located in sensitive areas, such as urban areas in which traffic is mainly concentrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I shall turn to the issue of funding. This programme, as we know, has been the subject of delicate negotiations in the context of the financial perspective, the result of which is an overall sum of EUR 400 million, much less than that proposed by the Commission. This is regrettable as it is indicative of less strategic ambition. As it is not possible to obtain greater resources, as the Commission rightly proposed, it will be the use and distribution of this sum of money that will dictate the success of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore commend Mr Rack, the rapporteur, on the proposed reduction of the eligibility ceiling for some products. This will make this programme more accessible for SMEs, which make up a significant portion of the business world and which employ a significant proportion of the European workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives contained in this report and the solutions that it puts forward will certainly have a decisive impact on the future of Europe’s freight transport, in terms of its fluidity and its sustainability. It is therefore vital that it obtains Parliament’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many have said in this House, we must obtain a more environmentally friendly transport system in Europe. We have a very great deal of environmental pollution. At the same time, transport is extremely important for our regions and for companies out in the regions. Combined transport will become extremely important in the future if transport systems are to operate throughout the territory of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo project also reveals the different conditions under which we live in the various regions of the EU. In many regions, there are long distances to be travelled. Companies in these regions are in many cases subcontractors for larger companies in more heavily populated areas. They are very important for employment in those regions that are a long way away. The Marco Polo project ought not, therefore, to lead to employment in the EU being relocated. I have proceeded in the committee on the basis of this view and can now accept the compromise relating to Article 1 of the report to the effect that the Marco Polo project should create added value for the EU without damaging economic, social or territorial cohesion, as well as the future Article 2 to the effect that the project should not adversely affect production or employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank him for this proposal, for this initiative and for his speech confirming the positive steps being taken. I would like to express my appreciation to Mr Rack for his work, as we have received a document which could make a significant contribution to more effective use of the transport infrastructure by means of active support for intermodal solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that the European Union budget, including that for the period 2007-2013, will have much less funding available for transport than we would have wished to receive. This means that it will be better all round if the solutions based on using the existing infrastructure are as good as possible. I would also very much like to stress that this is a historical moment: an enlarged European Union, perhaps with two more members from 1 January 2007. We therefore have the opportunity to involve the new Member States in shaping a new European transport and logistics system. It is very important to maintain the role played hitherto by the railways in the new Member States. Finally, I am pleased that we see an opportunity and a new role for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that we are moving in the direction of stabilising the transport and logistics systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate us, the European Union, on the existence and improvement of this Marco Polo programme, which is achieving effective results through its efficient, although possibly too discreet, work.</p>
<p class="contents">I value its achievements compared with other programmes and projects due to, among other things, its activities, which are on a small scale but add significant value in return. In addition, access for SMEs is being improved, along with short and medium-term plans, which gives an immediate visibility to the value of the European Union. This is a tool that is driven by demand and therefore produces effective and consolidated results. Finally I would like to highlight its strength as a means of proposing and driving forward innovative measures and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the addition of motorways of the sea, I must refer to the example of the successful relationship between Valencia and the Italian coastlines and the avoidance of traffic through the integration of logistics, and in the last few days we have learnt that a company like Mercadona – which is now achieving ratios close to those of Carrefour in Spain – is in discussions with RENFE regarding a permanent transfer from lorries to trains. We think that this is another example driven by this type of programme. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to express two wishes: from the experience of Marco Polo I and this improved Marco Polo II, and looking to the review of the White Paper on Transport, I hope that the successes and achievements of this programme will help us to maintain a firm commitment to modal shift from roads to more sustainable modes of transport, and logistics will obviously be the key to this. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, and for this I trust in the Commission and the Commissioner, who have the necessary ability and enthusiasm, I hope that the successes and formulas of Marco Polo are incorporated into the discussions on the trans-European networks, which ultimately have the same objective but on a very much larger scale, which sometimes makes them difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we now have a proposal for EUR 400 million over seven years, with new priorities that need to be funded, eligibility thresholds 50% lower and twice the geographical scope.

<p class="contents">I rather doubt that, under these circumstances, the hoped-for trigger and lever effects will materialise, and I find that deeply regrettable, all the more so because 'Marco Polo II' is a programme that has already proven itself to be effective.</p>

This is a huge figure.</p>
<p class="contents">This increase certainly has numerous negative consequences which we all know about: pollution, congestion of the roads, accidents and particularly high infrastructure maintenance costs. The way to cut this spiralling increase in road transport and limit its negative consequences is to develop alternative forms of transport and, in particular, to strengthen short-distance maritime transport by creating motorways of the sea and rail and inland waterway transport. However, this must be done in conjunction with the harmonisation of the networks of areas bordering the European Union, because a great part of the burden comes from there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo programme may help in this direction, by financing appropriate actions to prevent the risk of our road transport system collapsing. Certainly, like other programmes for the next period from 2007 to 2013, the budget is ultimately reduced in relation to what we had proposed.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council.
