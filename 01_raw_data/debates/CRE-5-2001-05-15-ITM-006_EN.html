<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, this report concerns the proposal for a Council recommendation on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents. Parliament has been asked to give its opinion on this issue. Our report will not become a binding piece of European legislation but will literally act as a recommendation to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this stage to thank the Swedish presidency for its interest in this issue and for organising the successful Stockholm Conference. The format of allowing young people to make their views known on an equal footing with health ministers made the dialogue all the more interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the growing evidence shows that children and adolescents are starting drinking at a younger age and drinking at worrying levels at a younger age. The problem is growing not only in the northern states but also in the southern states. France and Spain report growing problems of adolescent drunkenness, associated with fights, violence, truancy, theft and illegal drugs. Recent surveys show that the UK, Denmark, Finland, France and Sweden report the highest proportions of boys and girls who have been drunk at or younger than 13. Scotland, which I represent in this Parliament, has the highest rate of binge drinking amongst 15-year-olds. The gender gap is also closing, with more girls reporting having been drunk at 15 in Denmark, Finland, England, Scotland and Wales. Yet the simple fact is that children and adolescents are just more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than adults.</p>
<p class="contents">The rise of drinking to excess by children and adolescents has serious implications for future health. Drinking behaviour, which occurs during youth, can lead to similar patterns in adulthood. Certainly many colleagues here will know the consequences of drinking to excess. But in terms of misuse of alcohol by adolescents, the link between binge drinking, unplanned pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases, crime and road-traffic accidents cannot be denied. You need only go to your local police station or hospital to see the evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the solutions? Information, education and health promotion are critical in the fight against under-age binge drinking, as are health promotion policies targeted at children, parents, teachers and carers, better labelling on alcohol products, integration of adolescent policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing this report I contacted over a hundred schools and fifty youth organisations in Scotland. Townhill primary school in Dunfermline, where I live, summed up the need for more education when it found that most children in the class were not aware of the health and social problems associated with alcohol misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me on to my second point, an important one. More research is needed into the nature, scale and causes of this growing trend in binge drinking by children and adolescents. We need to improve data collection and share information. Kinghorn primary school in Fife thought that the research issue was important and that an e-mail network of pupils allowing them to discuss and explore the issues was critical.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the issue of selling to under-age people is also an important one. In many countries there are existing laws which should prevent this from happening. However, as we all know, this still goes on. The rise of bootlegged alcohol in many Member States is also a factor. Proper implementation of existing laws in Member States could go some way to prevent the selling to children and adolescents.</p>
<p class="contents">On codes of conduct: much of the alcohol industry has signed up to voluntary codes of conduct and has self-regulation. Much of the industry has tried to take a responsible view to this issue. However, there is a real concern among parents, teachers and young people themselves that not enough is being done on advertising. When you see pictures of babies in beer-logo babygrows, no wonder people have cause for concern. Powrie primary school in Dundee asked that alcohol should be made ‘uncool’; TV ads should show vomiting and hang-overs. Many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection supported the move for more binding regulation, and the debate continues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the need for joint action on education and research is critical in the fight against binge drinking by children and adolescents.</p>
<p class="contents">At St Elizabeth primary school in Hamilton they noted that there is more to life than the aspiration to get as drunk as possible in as little time as possible, with as big an audience as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the words of the World Health Organisation's European Charter on Alcohol: "All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol consumption and to the extent possible from the promotion of alcoholic beverage". I hope my colleagues will support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alcohol is part and parcel of adult social life. It is therefore logical that adolescents will come into contact with alcohol as they approach adulthood. Children and adolescents are normally unaware of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption; born of curiosity to try new things, it can quickly become a habit. The average age at which children and adolescents try their first alcoholic drink has not fallen. Young people continue to have their first contact with alcohol in their early teens, as in the past. The age at which regular alcohol consumption begins, however, is falling steadily.</p>
<p class="contents">Alcohol consumption by children and adolescents is an extremely emotive subject, since it concerns the rising generations of European citizens. The animated discussions in our committee left me in no doubt of the importance of this subject to every one of us. At this point I should like to thank all my fellow members for their contributions. We overwhelmingly took the view that responsibility in this area could not be assigned to parents alone; it was essential to create basic conditions in which adolescents could learn everything they needed to know in order to deal with exposure to alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to re-emphasise that my opinion relates specifically to children and adolescents and their dealings with alcohol and not to the health implications of alcohol abuse in general. In February of this year, as the rapporteur said, a conference was held on the subject of young people and alcohol. One of the points that were made in the declaration adopted at that conference is crucially important, in my view, and I have taken it into account in my opinion. It is the fact that care must be taken to ensure greater involvement of young people in these programmes and measures. It is particularly important that support and assistance be given to schemes devised by young people for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Since children and adolescents are affected by the problem, they must be involved in the effort to resolve it. This is the only way to ensure that young people actually commit themselves to the cause. Prohibitions and regulations alone will not help young people to become responsible adults – quite the reverse. We can only achieve that if we let them learn to assume responsibility themselves.</p>

May I also say that the Commission has produced a good basis for a recommendation to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The unimpaired development and health of our children and teenagers is a matter of concern to all of us. Mrs Stihler and Mrs Zissener have both indicated the nature of the problem in Europe. For adults in Europe, the consumption of alcohol is often, though by no means universally, an integral part of social life. Young people, however, are shaped by the drinking habits of adult society, which they copy. Alcohol consumption is therefore widely regarded as part of growing up.</p>
<p class="contents">The drinking habits of young people largely reflect the attitudes and habits of the adult society in which they live. Role models are therefore of the essence. It is imperative that young people see alcohol being treated properly and wisely by their families and by society as a whole. Any inclination to abuse alcohol must be nipped in the bud. Targeted education campaigns must be used to combat alcohol abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of alcohol abuse affect us all. They affect families and societies. Road deaths caused by drunk drivers, loss of jobs and ultimately family break-ups are but a few examples of the ravages of alcohol abuse. At the national level there are already many sound laws for the protection of children and adolescents, such as the laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. Strenuous efforts must be made to ensure that these existing national laws are more effectively enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Warnings printed on labels, extending to comparisons such as ‘one glass of brandy equals three glasses of beer’, if I understood Mrs Stihler’s amendment correctly, would serve little purpose, in my opinion. Such comparisons create confusion and might even give the impression that particular alcoholic drinks could safely be consumed in larger quantities. Such comparisons cannot give any indication of the actual effects of a beverage on individual people or of an individual’s consumption capacity. On the contrary, they might induce people to misjudge their own tolerance levels. Such warnings would not constitute consumer education; they would be more likely to confuse or even mislead consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Producers and purveyors of alcoholic beverages are heavily involved in the sponsorship of sports clubs and cultural organisations and of the events in which they participate. A ban on the sponsorship of youth events would ultimately deprive clubs of vital income. Why should a brewery which sponsors an adult sports event for a club or association not be allowed to make its marquee available for a youth event too? Whether a ban on sponsorship would actually have an educational impact is a moot question. The most likely effect is that the clubs and associations could no longer afford to stage youth events, which means that young people would be the losers at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Alcohol, tobacco and drugs are three distinct problems and need to be treated differently. I hope we are addressing each of these problems, and indeed I am sure that we do address them on an everyday basis. I therefore ask the House to refrain from any attempt to lump these three very important issues together in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Μalliori (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, unfortunately, we all know that drunken driving is the primary cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, not forgetting that this figure does not include the number of people disabled as the result of road traffic accidents caused by drunken driving. The consumption of alcohol, especially at a young age, is becoming an increasing cause of concern to the public and experts alike. The problem appears to be more acute in northern Europe, where it is linked to an increase in the number of suicides.</p>
<p class="contents">Another worrying dimension is that younger and younger children, irrespective of sex or social class, are drinking more and more regularly. It would be helpful, I think, given that numerous, somewhat cloudy terms are being used, such as use, dependence, abuse, excessive use, if we were to use the term applied by the World Health Organisation, which talks of ‘harmful use’ and which refers to the amount, frequency, conditions, form and consequences of alcohol use by young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council recommendation should be more specific; what we want is uniform European legislation on this matter. What we need, first and foremost, is preventive intervention designed to limit use and I think that any reference to measures which restrict demand is important and that our policy should revolve around it. Access by young people to places in which alcoholic beverages are easily obtainable must be specially regulated, together with any other measures to control supply. The fact is that we need to be proactive and ensure that young people are correctly informed about the side effects of a drinking habit, as they are for other psychotropic substances, both legal and illegal. Special reference also needs to be made to the role of advertising. It is unacceptable that alcoholic beverage companies should direct advertising campaigns at young people, a group of consumers which is highly susceptible to the messages it receives. What we need to do, within the framework of the European Union, is to organise proper information campaigns and special training seminars for people who come into contact with young consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Having extended its remit to other psychotropic substances, the European Drugs Monitoring Centre could play a decisive role both in this sense and in collating reliable and comparable epidemiological data.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I should like to express my hope that the European Commission has understood how serious this issue is and will introduce clear and specific regulations which deal effectively with such a serious issue, which concerns the health and security of our youngsters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is, how motherly should the European Union be in the quest to protect itself from its subjects? Indeed, we can see major differences compared to the control of tobacco. Tobacco is always harmful, whereas alcohol is not, most of the time. The addictive aspects are completely different. Tobacco is immediately addictive, alcohol is not. Also, the seriousness of the tobacco issue is of a completely different order from that of alcohol. Alcohol does create problems, and sometimes they can be harrowing. Just think of the road victims caused by alcohol abuse, which Mrs Malliori mentioned a moment ago, or the role of alcohol in domestic violence. However, the issues are first and foremost of a criminal nature and, as such, they belong with the national, not the European, legislator. This is also preferable for reasons of content. The cultural differences in this area are enormous, and a legislator who is closer to the citizen can therefore act more effectively, and, in the final analysis, effectiveness is what it is all about. In addition, in the proposals, the differences between justified alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse have been watered down, if you will excuse the pun. In that respect, we believe that the present proposals are to some extent missing the mark. We also vehemently object to the patronising overtones of many of the amendments, in particular. We identified much more with the rapporteur’s original report, on which we should like to congratulate her. To the Member States, I would like to say the following: be as strict as you like in terms of controlling alcohol abuse, and especially alcohol abuse among young people, but do not hide behind the European Union and behind what you are about to arrange amongst yourselves behind closed doors in the Health Council. We do recognise the fact that the issue of alcohol has a European, cross-border dimension, although it is not evident from these proposals. These predominantly focus on the ingredients of alcohol products. We believe that European legislation in the field of labelling should at least be considered or examined. This could then include the possibility of using warning labels, as is done in the United States, for example, at least as long as it can be proven that these warning labels serve a purpose. It could also incorporate the issue of advertising. Secondly, the proposals deal with taxes, excise, tariffs and such like. The differences in this field within the Union are enormous. We wonder about the internal market implications this has, as well as the health implications. That is why my group has tabled an amendment on both scores. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I congratulate the Commission on this welcome initiative and the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, for strengthening and improving the Commission's recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Children and young people are drinking alcohol more frequently and starting not only to drink but to get drunk at an ever younger age. In Wales, my own constituency, half of all fifteen-year-olds drink beer every week. While I would usually be the first to welcome equality between the sexes, in this case we can only regret that over the past decade the number of girls drinking excessively has almost equalled that of boys in nearly every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people, as was said earlier, must be able to make their own informed decisions about alcohol. The report refers to the importance of involving young people themselves in the campaign to prevent alcohol abuse, so that the right, positive images and the right messages are used, which will reach young people and which will have an influence on them. We must stop the deliberate targeting of alcohol products at young people. We must have effective labelling and advertising of the dangers of alcohol, but also readily available information for young people, parents and all those involved in youth work to promote healthy living. In this way we may be able to stem the increasing prevalence of alcohol, which can be so destructive in the lives of young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paradoxically, with regard to abusive consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependency, little or nothing has been done. It is also a paradox that the real situation is very far removed from what is normally thought to be the case. Alcohol dependency is a much more widespread and deep-rooted problem in social and public health terms, with statistics in many countries showing that around 10% of the population could be classed as suffering from alcoholism. This is one of the unspoken tragedies of our times – society appears to be repeating the denial that is one of the defining features of alcoholism and other forms of drug addiction and, as is well known, is one of the major obstacles to recovery for those affected. The report and this recommendation counter the indifferent approach we have seen in the past and therefore deserve our congratulations and our support. They rightly focus on children and adolescents in particular. On the one hand, it is a known fact that alcohol consumption amongst the young has increased markedly and today we are even seeing cases of juvenile alcoholism, which was practically unknown or extremely rare a few decades ago. On the other hand, health education and information programmes targeting young people will, in the long term, also have a positive impact on the overall prevention of alcoholism. Many older alcoholism sufferers today are from generations that were unaware, that thought that there was no problem because things had always been that way. What we need to do now is to provide information, especially for young people. We must inform, warn, monitor, anticipate and prevent a human and social disaster. As a matter of fact, we are today facing new challenges, with a situation in which the market is swamped with products that purport to be harmless, such as alcoholic cool drinks or synthetic drinks that are specifically targeted at the youngest drinkers, which could represent the start of their alcohol abuse and, consequently, the door to the abyss, the danger of which we must expose. We sincerely hope that this recommendation will succeed and that it will be stringently monitored in all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you were to ask me to express a point of criticism, this would not be about the gist of this report, but I should only like to mention that, when I read this document, it appears at times that it is labouring quite a few obvious points in a fairly patronising manner, in other words, a number of opinions are being trotted out on which everyone is in fact agreed. One can also question whether it is, in fact, necessary to tackle an issue at European level once again, of which all Member States are very much aware and on which they are all taking measures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, allow me to express my surprise at the fact that, among the keen advocates of this report, especially in the parliamentary committee, I also discovered the names of MEPs from, for example, several Belgian parties in office who, in their own countries, support an actual policy to legalise soft drugs and implement such a policy by adopting an extremely flexible policy of tolerance, on the one hand, and by launching various specific propaganda campaigns promoting the use of soft drugs, on the other. This even includes the Ministers of parties in office who, via the mass media, openly admit to using soft drugs and who even light up joints while on television.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, I am extremely annoyed at this form of hypocrisy, where alcohol is rightly kept in check but where the use of marijuana and other dangerous drugs by a certain type of progressive intelligentsia is advertised as being politically correct.

One of the things that had to be learnt was that the units per day that you drink cannot be concentrated in binge drinking at the weekend because the level of alcohol in next day's bloodstream is then catastrophically high. Young people need to understand the danger of abuse, they need also to understand the effect of drinking on their study, on their ability to concentrate, on work, especially if they are working with machinery, on leisure and on sport, and we have inserted a warning about the risk of dying if you swim after drinking too much. Most serious of all is the role of alcohol abuse in triggering or exacerbating mental illness, and especially for young men as the precursor to suicide attempts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a useful report. It needs further study in some places, not least on the unit labelling, because in Britain the unit is eight grams of alcohol, in Spain and Denmark it is ten, in France it is twelve and in Portugal it is fourteen. We also need to look carefully at the sports grounds restrictions that are suggested, because there is a huge difference between a ninety-minute football match – give or take the half-time break – and many clubs of course ban alcohol in their grounds, and the all-day cricket match with the lunch and tea intervals. We have to be careful not to ban the hospitality boxes because of loss of revenue to sport and boardroom drinking because of loss of sanity to sports directors. But broadly I welcome this as a step for the Commission to consider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi said last year, here in this Chamber, that, out of consideration for the EU’s legitimacy in the eyes of the people, Parliament and the EU should not become involved in all manner of ridiculous matters. The abuse of alcohol by children and young people is no laughing matter – on the contrary – but the problem falls within the province of families, the local community and the Member States.

We are discussing the provision of information to young people and the risks of alcohol, but the proposal also contains so much that is over-protective and so many admonishments, and these are aspects I cannot support.

In fact, the EU must ensure that the differences are respected and, therefore, the advertising of beer on English television must be permitted, even if this might be unacceptable on Spanish television.

Now, we have exactly the same problem with alcohol; in other words, we are faced with approximately the same number of deaths, not only caused in road accidents, which is what we seem to focus on, but from cirrhosis of the liver, stomach cancer, throat cancer as well, and this is without including the various social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the case of tobacco products, we know that smoking a cigarette is no more dangerous than drinking a glass of wine. However, as in the case of tobacco products, we also know that drinking alcohol and adopting the habit of drinking begins at a young age, particularly because of the example shown by adults and the positive image it is given in advertisements.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, in fact, adopt the same type of measures for alcohol as for tobacco products, and from this point of view, although the Commission report is good, it does not go nearly as far, perhaps because the alcohol lobbies are still more powerful than those for tobacco products, or perhaps because of our culture and customs. We should, in fact, bring in labelling for all alcoholic drinks to cover 30% of the product’s surface, indicating that alcohol kills, that alcohol is dangerous for health. We should ban advertising of alcohol, however implicit. We should ban sponsorship of all activities, particularly sporting activities, by manufacturers of alcoholic drinks. I shall not give a lecture but the truth of the matter is, as in the case of tobacco products, we will not make progress through clamping down on consumers – only through prevention.

It is regrettable that in our understandable concern to tackle drugs and drug-trafficking we have by and large ignored what is for many people, young and old, a serious form of addiction with immense consequences for society and in particular individuals and their families. The cost to the state in terms of health costs, loss of work days and production is in my view greater than the revenue generated from the sale of alcohol. The survey referred to by the rapporteur in this report is startling, and it certainly gives me no pleasure to see Ireland at the top of that list. Surveys in Ireland reveal a similar and worrying trend with implications for the welfare of a generation of young people with enormous potential and opportunities. While each individual must at the end of the day take responsibility for his or her attitude to alcohol, there is in my view a need for much stronger action on the part of Member State governments and on the part of the Commission and this Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The targeting of young people by some manufacturers of so-called designer drinks is a case in point. A stop must be put to such activity and this Parliament, with the Council, should initiate strong action to deal with the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I acknowledge, therefore, that the Commission’s initiative has a valid basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, our competent committees, which have collectively drawn up around 50 amendments, have again sinned in their overzealous approach. If their ideas are adopted, instead of combating unsavoury alcoholism, they will have succeeded in harming, amongst others, a whole industry, in other words, the wine-producing industry. We should make a distinction between the moderate, responsible drinking of alcoholic beverages – of wine in particular, which is part of our culture – and alcohol and drug abuse. We cannot combat alcoholism by restricting supply. For instance, would you like the production of wine, beer and spirits to be banned, and to what extent? The majority of our countries have a ban on the sale of alcohol to minors and this legislation should be strictly enforced. Why, though, would we want to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages at competitions and other events? The Evin law in France, which is also inconsistent with the single market, bans all advertising of alcoholic beverages at sporting events, but does not ban their sale.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also already held epic debates on the labelling of alcoholic beverages. We have not, until now, succeeded in reaching agreement on a directive. A recommendation on alcohol consumption in young people is certainly not the way to obstruct us, proposing to place warnings about the dangers to health on each wine bottle, for example, despite the fact that experience has shown such warnings to be totally ineffective in the United States. There is, moreover, a law on labelling wines, which actually makes it illegal to make the public aware of the benefits of drinking wine in moderation, whereas it has been scientifically proven that drinking a few glasses of wine a day is an excellent way to prevent cancer, vascular diseases and Alzheimer’s disease in particular.</p>

We are not talking about adult drinking here, let us stress that. Some of my colleagues have raised the issue of subsidiarity. We are not dealing with a regulation or a directive here. We are simply talking about a recommendation. To try to deal with young people binge drinking and drinking to excess. It is a way for other countries to learn from each other. It is important, for instance, that school nurses and doctors are trained to spot the problems of excessive drinking by young people. We must realise that peer pressure is a problem, lack of self-esteem, parents drinking: those are all problems we should take into account. We should also make sure that we consult the NGOs, which have a great deal of experience in this field already, and make sure that producers and retailers are held responsible for their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally would like to see alcohol advertising banned at young people's sporting events, not at adult events but at young people's sporting events, and I believe very strongly that we should support this recommendation. The WHO is supporting measures in this field, the NSPCC is and I certainly hope my colleagues will vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important that when we speak about young people we should recognise that we may not be the best people to understand what they want. A lot of us are past the first flush of youth and, therefore, we may not be as clued up on today's youth culture as some of us might like to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps one of the key points or recommendations that should be in this report is that young people should be asked what they want, what pressures they suffer from and what drives them to binge drinking and abuse of alcohol. Maybe we would discover that some of the issues which we think of as problems are not problems at all, and that a lot of the difficulties are due firstly to the example they are given by their parents and the older generation; secondly, the acceptability of young people drinking and, thirdly, the way social events revolve around alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to ensure that we do not mix the message with regard to what is moderate and what is immoderate drinking. In particular, we should ensure that information campaigns are reactive and proactive towards young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of health problems, both psychological and physical, affecting young people because of alcohol abuse is enormous, as is the number of unwanted pregnancies, under-age pregnancies, violent assaults and suicides. The coroner in County Mayo on the western coast of Ireland said that sixty per cent of suicides or attempted suicides in that area were directly related to alcohol. Therefore we should have a clear enforcement of the law, an identity card system at national level to ensure that young people do not have access to alcohol and strict enforcement and penalties for people who supply young people with drink. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, combating alcohol-related harm is a public health priority in many Member States and also at EU level. This is clearly reflected in the draft of the future Public Health Action Programme where inappropriate use of alcohol is mentioned as one of the key health determinants to be tackled. Over the last couple of years, there has been growing evidence that alcohol consumption by young people and the corresponding health and social problems have increased alarmingly. This is why the Commission took the initiative to address the problems caused by the drinking of alcohol by young people in the form of a Council recommendation which is a valid instrument foreseen under the public health article of the Treaty, namely Article 152.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad discussions which we held during the last three years with the Member States, experts and stakeholders clearly show that the drinking behaviour of young people is increasingly similar throughout the European Union and that Community action is therefore justified and appropriate. I have been very pleased to learn that in the Council working group and in COREPER the Member States have welcomed this initiative very positively. I therefore believe that this is an issue for the European Union at European level, and not just an issue at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with those who say that this issue is different from tobacco. It must be distinguished from tobacco and indeed also drugs. It has been mentioned in the contributions this afternoon that we dealt with this yesterday in the directive that we discussed, and that is dealt with on an EU-wide basis. But there are many issues relating to alcohol consumption that must be addressed on an EU-wide basis also. For instance, advertising comes to mind. The codes of conduct that are contained in the television without frontiers legislation: are they being fully and properly complied with? These codes of conduct operate on an EU-wide basis. The advertising operates on an EU-wide basis, and as has already been stated by one of the honourable Members, this is a recommendation. It is not a directive or a regulation. I am equally pleased that the discussion in the European Parliament confirms our concerns and the way to tackle them. I welcome Parliament's intention to support the Commission's approach and to strengthen the proposal through the large number of very constructive amendments. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, and the Committee on the Environment for their constructive work.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis the Commission can accept Amendment Nos 1, 8, 10, 11, 18, 27, 30, 31 and 34. There are also a number of amendments which contain very valid ideas which can only be accepted by the Commission in a redrafted form to make them fit into the proposal structure and to keep the text consistent. I am speaking about Amendment Nos 7, 13, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 49, 50, 51 and 52. A range of Parliament's amendments suggest to enlarge the scope of the recommendation by proposing broader aspects of alcohol policy or concrete regulatory steps. I think that we should stick to the proposed approach which is, at this stage, to intensify health promotion and education efforts and to bring the producers and retailers to act responsibly. During the implementation of the recommendation and in the framework of the future debates on a strategic approach of the Community to reduce alcohol-related harm there will be room to discuss all aspects which could be relevant for an effective alcohol policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The following amendments can therefore not be accepted for the purpose of the recommendation, but the Commission will take account of their contents in the future strategy approach: these are Amendment Nos 5, 6, 14, 26, 29, 41, 44, 45, 47, 48, 53, 54, 55 and 56. In relation to Amendment No 53 I would draw the House's attention to Directive 79/112 on the labelling of foodstuffs which is a piece of legislation that is within my competence and of course will be kept under review and looked at in the context of the remarks that have been made by colleagues and of the other advice that I get in relation to the labelling of alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments cannot be accepted because they propose to change a quotation from a legal text and I refer to Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4. Others are unnecessary because the proposed subject is already covered in the proposal and I refer here to numbers 19, 25, 32 and 46. The subject matters of Amendment Nos 20 and 37 refer to issues which are too specific to be taken explicitly on board, although in principle they fall under the thematic approach of the proposal. Concerning Amendment No 23, the whole recommendation is about alcohol consumption by young people. The Commission believes it to be very important to mention drink-driving specifically. For this reason the amendment is not acceptable. Amendment No 36 cannot be accepted because of definition problems for the purpose of this recommendation. The age ban has not been defined by using the term under-age, and different legislation applies in different Member States. Amendment No 28 conflicts with the medical advice the Commission has received. Amendment No 43 would remove an important aspect of future codes of conduct and therefore cannot be accepted either. Some amendments can be partially accepted by the Commission. In Amendment No 9 the first two sentences cannot be accepted because assessment will have to cover all aspects and not just a shortlist of measures. It makes sense however to accept the reference to the regional and local level. The changes proposed in Amendment No 12 highlighting only some alcohol policy aspects and not others would be misleading and cannot therefore be accepted, except a reference to self-esteem by young people which the Commission can of course accept. In Amendment No 16 the Commission cannot accept mention of only certain specific aspects for evaluation as this would be counter-productive. However, references to good practices and to the role of the medical practitioners are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to seeing the recommendation being implemented because there is no doubt that this will be an excellent basis for working jointly towards a common aim, to better protect our young people, especially children and adolescents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
