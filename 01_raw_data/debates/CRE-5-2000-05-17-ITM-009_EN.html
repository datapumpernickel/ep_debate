I also welcome the mandate conferred on me by the European People’s Party to present such a major topic as the poor countries’ debt, which is stifling the economy of the world’s poorest developing countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The scale of this issue is global, and it involves all the civilised, democratic countries which are helplessly standing by, watching the constant growth of the debt of poor countries, which now have to set aside an average of 40% of their annual budget to finance it. Every year, the debt increases by approximately 12%, and it has risen from USD 110 billion in the 80s to its present value of USD 350 billion. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has attempted to deal with the issue on more than one occasion, but it has never appeared to find satisfactory solutions. This year, on account of it being a Jubilee Year, the Holy See and other quarters are calling for the substantial reduction, if not total cancellation, of the international debt in such a way as to facilitate the integration of the most indebted countries into the world production and commercial trade circuit. The UN Secretary-General also fervently appealed, on 3 April last, to the donor countries and international financial institutions to cancel all the official debts of the highly indebted poor countries from their accounts as a millennium gesture. </p>
<p class="contents">A similar appeal was made by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but the time for appeals has passed. It is facts that are important now. If we analyse the situation, we realise that, on the one hand, we are talking about an almost irrecoverable debt and, on the other, that in return for cancelling that debt, we can demand greater respect for human rights, greater democracy and social actions benefiting poor communities – improving conditions for children, the elderly and the disabled. In addition, we would be stemming migration flows, which, quite apart from being a problem for the migrants’ countries of origin, are, above all, a problem for the host countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would ask whether the Council is aware of all the initiatives which have hitherto been adopted by each individual country of the Union to reduce or cancel the debt of highly indebted poor countries, and whether it would be possible for a résumé to be produced showing the practical actions which have been undertaken by these countries and the commitments made, to prove that these initiatives are not just mere political vote-winning manoeuvres, as they all too often appear to be.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, considering that there is a clear need for a common foreign policy displaying Europe as a coherent system capable of undertaking united initiatives, does the Commission not feel that it would be appropriate to create a structure to study this issue, which would work together with the local Churches, NGOs and civil society and act upon the conclusions reached? This would, I feel, be a different way of interpreting the meaning of the millennium, this time in the name of solidarity between communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware of the situation. These countries’ resources – and even resources that they do not have – are used up to service their debts; for some of these countries, interest and capital repayments account for 40% of their budget. In spite of this, the debt continues to grow exponentially, and there is consequently an ever-widening gap between these countries and the industrialised countries, which often behave like unscrupulous moneylenders. The imposition of unsuitable structural adjustment<span class="bold"> </span>programmes by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and inadequate cooperation and development aid actions by the industrialised countries, which fall considerably short of the 0.7% of GDP recommended by the United Nations, both contribute to this gap. There is an erroneous, trade-based concept that has also made matters worse. This concept suggests that, under the auspices of the WTO, the market can regulate and resolve everything, whereas the opposite is true: economic globalisation has greatly contributed to accentuating disparities, increasing injustice and holding back development. It is obvious that this situation must, therefore, be resolved by adopting a worldwide project and by a new world order that puts the development of these countries at the top of its priorities. This must be based on the idea that everyone, and I mean everyone, including the rich countries, will benefit from this development. A project of this kind can only succeed through debt relief, which cannot be reduced to a process that is merely full of good intentions, as recommended by the G7 countries, whose contribution represents no more than 1% of Third World debt and which is today limited in practice to partial debt relief for just three or four countries. The European Union and its Member States can, and must, speak up on this issue, abandoning their limited outlooks, which are full of conditions, which often accompany shamefaced announcements about debt cancellation, and end the aid cuts that have been taking place and which are proposed for the future. Instead, they must put forward a broad and resolute plan that will make a decisive contribution to ending a situation of this kind and help to put the development of such important parts of the world into perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this subject, the Cairo Summit did not, any more than other summits, come up with any even remotely clear conclusion. This step is, however, a matter of simple common sense, and one is tempted to ask the Council whether they intend one day to refer the matter to their common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole thing verges on the ridiculous. Not only do the countries of the south not have the financial resources to pay back their debts but, on top of that, the international economic order, which has foisted a demented concept of liberalism on the world, is preventing the majority of our partners in the south – I am thinking in particular of those in Northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa – acceding to the conditions for development that is even remotely sustainable. Such conditions are continually demolished by the blind application of free trade, accompanied by the obsessive, ideological privatisation of the exploitation of most of their wealth. The rich countries, foolishly falling in line with the imperialist rules of the IMF and the World Bank, were nonetheless the first to realise that this cannot damage economic take-off since their own development did not fail on occasion to resort to the rules of protectionism, ensuring, moreover, a privileged place for the state and for public intervention in all its forms.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace between nations can only be achieved if there is balance. Political and economic balance are, on the other hand, devastating to a world which is increasingly unipolar. As we well know, despite the head-in-the-sand policy practised by rich countries with no thought for the future which takes the world down some highly dangerous roads, and while this House gets bogged down in details and side issues, it is high time that we were able to look at the world as a whole. Instead of leaving our only reasonable policy, i.e. the Lomé agreements, high and dry, we ought to be forming genuine economic and, more importantly, political partnerships with the Mediterranean and African countries. But, for that, Europe would have to have an authority legitimate and clear-sighted enough to get out of the trap of all-out liberalism and, of course, it has no such authority worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The harsh and tragic figures are there for all to see. The 50 poorest countries spend twice what they receive in aid in order to pay off their debt. An average of 40% of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments. Not only does that undermine their economic development, not only does that significantly reduce their ability to provide basic social services, such as health or education, but it creates a sort of slavery which benefits Western societies.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact two thirds of the debt is generated by interest on earlier loans, loans taken out to pay for the things we sold them, which multinationals sold them. This is highly reminiscent of the exploitation of agricultural workers in some countries who are forced to buy from the boss’s shop at inflated prices and who are then forced to work for the rest of their lives for scant wages in order to pay off their debts to this shop. What action are we taking to prevent this?</p>
<p class="contents">The G7 countries announced amid much publicity a debt reduction programme, but conditions are such that it cannot be applied. This initiative remains subject to macroeconomic reform programmes under the aegis of the IMF or the World Bank, which run counter to the objectives of eradicating poverty, due to their restrictive effect on the ability to spend on social services and job creation. Some major countries have announced that they are going to cancel debts, but this is selective, linked to the interests of certain parties, and is achieved to the detriment of development budgets. The indebted countries were expecting a strong message from the Conference between the European Union and Africa held in Cairo recently. They were given plenty of fine words, but no practical action.</p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives do the Commission and the Council propose to take at European or international level in order to further relieve or cancel the burden of debt in order to aid the poorest countries? How does the Commission plan to ensure that the appropriations made available by cancelling the debt are properly invested in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development? Finally, what is the Commission’s reaction to the requests presented by some civil society organisations in the countries of the south for improvements in monitoring the macroeconomic adaptation plan, by organising conferences on national development, in order to give public opinion in these countries an opportunity to define national priorities and projects? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This being so, the European Union as such is merely a marginal creditor. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the European Union has not shrunk from participating in all the initiatives to provide debt relief for the poorest countries. I would remind you that in 1996, the IMF/World Bank interim and development committees approved, at their respective annual meetings, an initiative on the debt of highly indebted poor countries, the HIPC initiative. The Community and the Member States then committed themselves to take part in this initiative by providing exceptional aid to the ACP countries on the basis of the commitment given by the international financial community to reduce the indebtedness of these countries to a sustainable level, on condition that the countries concerned would implement economic reform programmes.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In July 1998, the Council approved a decision on exceptional aid for the highly indebted ACP countries and earmarked an initial sum of EUR 40 million from the interest accumulated on European Development Fund funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1999, at the G7 summit, the Heads of State and Government agreed to extend the HIPC initiative in order to provide more substantial and speedy debt relief. This approach was further backed by the Bretton Woods institutions at their annual meetings in September 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Community, at their session last December, the Council of ACP-EU Ministers decided that unallocated programmable EDF resources could be used as subsidies. This would be done in order to meet the outstanding debt and debt servicing commitments towards the Community of the first ACP countries to qualify for such a scheme under the HIPC initiative, with a total amount of EUR 320 million. These resources could also be used, up to a maximum of EUR 680 million, as a contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund managed by the World Bank, with a view to overall financing of this initiative. It is envisaged that, at the EDF Committee meeting this July, the European Commission will submit proposals for the implementation of this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also guaranteed EUR 250 million of additional constitutional funds for structural adjustment, to make it easier for eligible countries to access debt cancellation measures. Furthermore, it is worth adding that, following the resolutions I have just mentioned, and also as a result of the decisions taken at the recent Cairo Summit, various Member States have stated that they are already willing to unilaterally add their own measures for the reduction, conversion or complete cancellation of huge amounts owed by developing countries, particularly by the highly indebted poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union believes that improvements to this initiative must be based on integrated programmes which link debt relief more closely to the objectives of sustainable development and the reduction of poverty. Despite these efforts by the European Union, the current problem is not so much one of increasing debt cancellation, but of ensuring that the new, enhanced HIPC initiative is effectively implemented by all donors. In order for this whole initiative not to collapse at the outset, it is crucial for the United States to bear its share of multilateral debt relief. We therefore hope that all donor countries will continue to make efforts to jointly implement the decisions that have been taken so that the greatest possible number of eligible countries can benefit. Parliament will be kept informed about these developments on a regular basis, and in particular about the progress of the decision to participate in the HIPC initiative. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your questions about monitoring the use of funds released under these initiatives, I think that the only thing we can do is to encourage the beneficiary countries to make the best use of these facilities, as we cannot guarantee, as some seem to think, that the monies provided for debt cancellation will be invested in the social sphere, and especially in health and education. I think that this rationale and this kind of intervention, no matter how well intentioned they may be, can be viewed, depending on how one chooses to interpret them, as a form of neo-colonial intervention. This is not and can never be the purpose of intervention in the internal management, and particularly the budgetary management, of these countries, either on the part of the European Union or of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to total debt cancellation, which some honourable Members have also suggested, it is worth remembering that the experts in this field would come up with various arguments against this option. In particular, it is highly unlikely that private banks would provide loans to these countries if they are expecting that these debts will be totally written off by public creditors. Furthermore, it is worth bearing in mind that in political terms, creating an expectation that debts will automatically be cancelled on a regular basis will inevitably reduce the credit institutions’ willingness to provide money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was launched in September 1996 with the aim of helping to relieve the debt burden of the poorest countries that make adjustment efforts in a concerted way. It represents a coordinated effort by all donors including, in particular, multilateral creditors. It was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, on the occasion of the G7 Cologne Summit, ministers agreed to an expanded and more flexible initiative that will provide faster, deeper and broader debt relief. As a result of the proposed changes, the costs of this HIPC II Initiative are expected to increase significantly to some USD 27.4 billion from a previous estimated level of some USD 13 billion of HIPC I. In fact, the original estimate of the cost of HIPC I was around USD 8 billion only.</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, the Commission has already made a large contribution to HIPC I. The Council adopted, on 6 July 1998, a decision on the Community’s participation in the HIPC Initiative with regard to its claims, special loans and risk capital managed by the European Investment Bank for eligible ACP countries. As mentioned before, the Community, as a creditor, is only a small player in this discussion. Fortunately, we are mainly a provider of direct grant assistance and not loans.</p>
<p class="contents">We set aside EUR 40 million of interest accumulated on EDF funds which should cover the cost for the first six country cases. Community assistance for Uganda and Guyana was delivered in mid-1998 and early 2000, amounting to EUR 4.59 million and EUR 6.44 million respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has since decided to considerably enhance support for the HIPC II Initiative. At the annual meeting in Washington in September 1999, it was announced that the Community’s contribution would be in the order of EUR 1 billion. The Commission subsequently submitted draft proposals for decisions to the Joint EU/ACP Council and the EU Council which were adopted by the General Affairs Council on 6 December and by the Joint EU/ACP Council on 8 December.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be borne in mind that the ACP countries’ agreement is required because it is EDF money that is being reallocated so their consent is needed as part of these decisions. At present, the Commission is in the process of finalising discussions with its Member States, the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank about the main principles of the actual implementation of the Community support for the HIPC II Initiative, both as a donor and as a creditor. In June, it will present the relevant financing proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s global contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund in its capacity as a donor will amount to EUR 680 million for qualifying ACP countries. EUR 670 million will be earmarked for the African Development Bank in order to cover its financing gap in the HIPC Initiative and EUR 10 million for the only non-African HIPC ACP country, Guyana.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 680 million Community contribution originating from the EDF will be channelled to the HIPC Trust Fund in 3 tranches taking into consideration effective financing needs as well as support from other donors. According to the information available, needs for the first tranche this year will be in the order of the magnitude of EUR 250 million. The first EC tranche will be paid in July. Besides these contributions to be financed from uncommitted EDF funds, a EUR 54 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund will also be made towards non-ACP HIPCs drawing on resources from the budgetary lines for Latin America and Asia. We want, in other words, to make sure that the EU participation in HIPC is global and in accordance with the figures in HIPC.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it must be stressed that the ACP/EU Council decision to reinforce the EC Structural Adjustment Facility by EUR 250 million will partly be used to provide interim relief to eligible HIPC countries belonging to the ACP. It is important to stress that the Community contribution to debt relief should not be seen as a substitute for contributions from bilateral donors. These are still needed in order to fully finance the initiative announced at the G7 Summit in Cologne. The expectation created a year ago was that the G7 countries would come up with additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards other contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund, it may be worth noting that the draft budget by the US administration suggests a US contribution of USD 600 million which follows on from pledges made earlier and which corresponds to the share of HIPC calculated by the World Bank for the US. This draft budget needs to be passed in Congress and this is definitely facing some difficulties. In fact, it seems very doubtful that the US will deliver its share as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">The funds released by the Commission for the HIPC Initiative are subject to the same principles as other funds originating from the European Development Fund and the Commission is carefully involving the EDF Committee, that is Member States, at all stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 366(b) of the Lomé Convention in its present form imposes strict conditions on the possible use of EDF money. Politically speaking, it would not make sense to stop EDF financed projects in Article 366(b) countries and to provide them with EC <span class="italic">quasi </span>direct non-earmarked budget support, for example through HIPC debt relief mechanisms. It is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that EDF money does not facilitate a <span class="italic">coup d'état</span> or provide additional budgetary room for manoeuvre to enable dictators to oppress their people. It is the very purpose of Article 366(b) in its present form to make things more complicated for countries breaching elementary human rights and good governance principles. This view has also been clearly expressed by the European Court of Auditors when commenting on these issues. Our hands are somewhat tied in this discussion on how we can accomplish these things in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In the discussions, which led last year to the agreement on enhancing the HIPC Initiative, there was a strong consensus in the donor community that poverty reduction needs to be re-emphasised as a main focus of development efforts. The concept of the poverty reduction strategy papers was launched to provide a framework for mainstreaming poverty reduction in government and donor policies. It will require a country-specific approach to assessing a country’s position in development, poverty strategies and institutional capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has expressed its strong support for this radically new approach initiated by the World Bank and the IMF. Country ownership is paramount for the development of these ideas and governments will have responsibility for both the design process and the final product. The Commission attaches particular importance to an open participatory process involving civil society, parliaments and all relevant international institutions and donors. Policies that address issues of social justice and equity are as central as economic policy to growth and poverty reduction. The Community is maintaining and stepping up its commitment to support macroeconomic reforms, social sectors, regional integration and sound economic management.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all needed in order to make sure that fighting poverty remains the central theme when we are actually improving the situation of these poor countries through the enhanced HIPC Initiative. I think that it is quite good that the Commission and the EU in general clearly stand out as the single most important contributor towards making this initiative actually work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have had the privilege of visiting many of these countries in the past year and I have to say that, in many cases, one’s sympathy turns to anger when one sees the abject poverty that people in these countries live in while their leaders and ministers revel in wealth and prosperity and one begins to question the distribution of aid and debt relief.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the help given from Europe, individual nation states and institutions, Africa’s external debt is growing by about 12% per annum and some countries are repaying more in interest than they are receiving in aid. That cannot be allowed to continue, but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen. I will be criticised by some honourable Members for saying it, but conditionality must be built into not only development aid but also debt relief.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always maintained that good governance was more important than pure democracy if you are going to stamp out corrupt practices, and if we cannot wipe these practices out we are only pouring good money after bad. We must therefore be in a position to monitor the effect of debt relief and make sure that all of it is spent on civil society to give better health, education and employment prospects to the people who are being denied it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a secondary effect of bad governance and that is the lack of external investment into these countries which denies them the chance of improved prosperity, better employment prospects and a higher standard of living. The fight against fraud and corruption should be made a condition for allocating debt relief and development aid – not my words, Mr President, but the words of President Obasanjo of Nigeria in Abuja at the opening of the 13th session of the ACP-EU Assembly. If only that could be echoed by every other president in Africa, the resistance to giving debt relief would diminish and some real progress could be made in alleviating the misery and poverty of millions of people.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This civil war has been responsible for 50 000 deaths, 2 million refugees and the brutal mutilation of 40 000 men and women of all ages in a systematic campaign of terror. Most of Africa is affected by similar tragedies, including the tragedy affecting the Sahrawi people, with which we came face to face this morning just outside here. </p>
<p class="contents">The other side to globalisation is poverty, the indebtedness of the poorer developing countries and the extension of those conflicts which reduce potential for development whilst exacerbating other conflicts and causing fresh poverty. This is why the recent EU-Africa Summit held in Cairo was so important. It reopened global dialogue with the countries of the African continent and, for the first time, associated the development aid policy with the upholding of democratic principles, rights and the fight against corruption. A long-term strategy is essential, and cancelling the debt is the starting point for such a strategy. As the resolution tabled by the European Socialist Party states, it is therefore important to increase the percentage of resources set aside by industrialised countries for the poorest countries, but, at the same time, the quality of our undertaking is also crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution puts forward two major options: new sustainability criteria and greater flexibility for the more indebted countries, and the bilateral cancellation of the debts of the least developed ACP countries. These are initial, tangible recommendations, although, in future, we must avoid the repetition of the spiral of debt, with no checks on the choices made. Indeed, we are aware that it is not sufficient to cancel the debt if the other mechanisms determining all the policies remain unchanged. Cancellation of the debt must be conditional upon the use to which the resources thereby released are put. These resources must be invested in schools, hospitals and the human development of communities, not wasted, as still often occurs today, due to corruption or, what is worse, used to boost the arms trade and support ruinous wars. The global economy must be accompanied by a global policy; growth must go hand in hand with the upholding of human and civil rights and the consolidation of democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid the spiral of debt, we therefore need to supplement the means for action: there must be greater cooperation, increased trade exchange, an increase in initiatives to prevent conflicts and more coherent opposition to corrupt, indebted governments which visit upon their citizens the hardship caused by crises and poor development. Our commitment to cancelling the debt is a precondition for the introduction of all the policies for reducing poverty. Resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development. In order to succeed, we need to harmonise national policies and supplement them with greater opening up of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent EU-ACP agreements follow this rationale and provide assistance for the 31 least developed countries over a period of time which should end in 2005. In this context, it is essential to involve the private sector in order to boost trade exchange and, in addition to transferring resources, to create the necessary conditions for the growth of an internal market for<span class="bold"> </span>developing countries, and provide incentives as well as laying down conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why the disastrous vicious circle of loans, debts and new loans must be broken. The immense repayment costs prevent any form of development. There is hardly any money left for education, health care or for building well-functioning government machinery. Debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency. This should be facilitated in a joint effort involving all creditors, the Union, the States, especially the United States, international institutions and banks. </p>
<p class="contents">However, a very broad strategy will not get us much further. The debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country. It is essential in this respect to tackle not just the social problems, but also to lay a firm foundation for sustainable economic development. If this fails to materialise, then foreign investments will not be forthcoming either. </p>
<p class="contents">A prerequisite for relieving debts is sound financial housekeeping within the governments concerned. We should not be naïve about this. We can no longer write out blank cheques. In the past, billions never reached the intended causes. A great deal of money got into the hands of corrupt regimes which allowed Swiss banks to benefit from the large-scale theft of development aid. When will the civilised world finally realise that countries which maintain banking secrecy are accessory to huge crimes at the expense of the poorest population groups. </p>
<p class="contents">The IMF and the World Bank started an initiative back in 1996 to relieve the debts of the poorest countries. Last summer, the conditions were amended, with good reason. Aid was made conditional upon tangible results. It would be wonderful if the European Union and the Member States were to take a generous stance if the conditions were met. Let us do everything possible to help the poorest countries fight poverty. This can work if the victim is involved in his own rescue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are at least two questions which I think must be answered. The first is: how can the EU and the G7 nations, together with other Western countries, comply with their commitments so that these do not merely become empty promises? In spite of what the Council and the Commission have said, it is, of course, a fact that, notwithstanding the praiseworthy initiative that has been taken, the G7 countries have not so far, unfortunately, taken measures to comply with that initiative. All that has happened so far is that the debts of a mere three developing countries have been written off to the tune of 0.25 per cent. That is naturally not enough. Even those EU countries which have said that they wish to write off the debts have not appropriated funds in their budgets for this purpose. On occasions, the funds concerned have been taken from the areas of cooperation and development. </p>
<p class="contents">The most important question of all is: how can it be ensured that the resources are properly used in developing countries? The Council responded by saying that it was not in favour of that kind of control. However, the EU, the IMF and the World Bank have, of course, established criteria in other contexts, so why should we not be able to establish criteria to ensure that, for the people, the result of debt cancellation really will be… </p>

Many people in Africa are sinking into poverty and increasing numbers of them are immigrating to European countries, which are in the throes of a demographic depression. It must be remembered that this poverty coincides with the botched decolonisation of the 1960s which plunged many of these countries into poverty and ethnic conflict, related also to the establishment of dictatorships which were corrupt and, more often than not, it must be acknowledged, Socialist.</p>
<p class="contents">What we would like to say is that cancelling poor countries’ debt is no doubt a laudable intention and we are in favour of staggering payments<span class="underline">,</span> but we would like to see the root of the trouble being tackled with the same seriousness. We may note, for example, that until the 1990s, the African states which were still linked to France by means of economic, monetary and military cooperation agreements represented a haven of stability and relative prosperity. The same is true of the states which have maintained links with western powers by means of economic agreements of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">We think this is a more serious solution to the problems of the third world than the outrageous recommendation which the UN made on 4 January to the effect that, in order to offset its falling birth rate, Europe should prepare to accept 159 million immigrants from African countries over the next 25 years. Turning Europe into a third-world country is not, we feel, the way to help the third world achieve a genuine degree of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The real solution is in Africa in the form of a development policy which enables Africans to live in their own countries, which raises the question of the alleged benefits of free trade. Our opinion is that there are no real benefits or, if there are, then only for countries at a comparable economic and social level, and that it is only when protected by secure frontiers and customs rights that these countries will gradually progress from the cottage industry phase to that of industrialisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a year in which, based on the concept of the biblical Holy Year, we need to think seriously about relieving the debt of the poorest of the poor. In the Holy Year, each fiftieth year, debts were cancelled, slaves released and the land was left fallow in Israel. Such a year created the opportunity to start the future with a clean slate. In analogy with this biblical reference, the year 2000 should become a Holy Year for the world’s poorest of the poor. We therefore welcome national and international initiatives to reduce debts with open arms. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot refrain from making a number of critical remarks in respect of the proud announcements made by a number of G7 countries over the past few years. These rich countries boast about the fact that they no longer make a fuss about the gigantic amounts which these poor countries owe them. Experiences with the HIPC initiative dating back to 1996, however, have shown that debt reduction has not always had an altogether positive effect on the development of the poor. In the best-case scenarios, 100% debt relief only yields an actual 40% reduction in the debt. The reason for this is firstly that the conditions tied in with the debt relief are such that only few countries qualify. Moreover, room for debt relief is often found in national and international budgets for development policy. As such, it is not a matter of making available additional financial resources but more a matter of shifting funds. Poor countries may spend less on repaying their debts, but they also have to cope with a drop in foreign aid. If we really want to take the fight against world poverty seriously, debt reduction should be accompanied by an active policy to combat poverty. In this respect, it is desirable to deploy local governments and NGOs. </p>
<p class="contents">These minor observations, however, do not detract from the fact that concessions made must be met and new initiatives have to be launched. A careful and generous stance is a welcome bonus in this respect. The Commission, Member States and international donors must make every effort to turn the year of Our Lord 2000 into a Holy Year in the true sense of the word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These speeches were given at the G7 meeting, at the European Summit in Lisbon and at the recent Euro-African Summit in Cairo. The question we are left with today is: what will come of this? We have heard a few examples from the HIPC-I and HIPC-II programmes and I understand that 1 billion is tied up in this second programme. The total debt burden of all developing countries comes to 350 billion. This means that, in comparison, this 1 billion is really peanuts. Many of those countries pay 25% to 40% of their national budget on interest and repayment into banks in Western Europe, the United States and Japan. The harsh reality is that the billions which are paid to repay debts far exceed the development aid. That is a disastrous situation because we often ask ourselves why our development aid does not work. Well, here is one of the most important reasons. If a sum of money comes in and subsequently a sum has to be repaid which is three or four times the original amount, then those countries will not make any headway, of course. </p>
<p class="contents">One question which remains is: should you cancel debts unconditionally? I do not share the view of Mr Miranda or other MEPs who think one should. In my opinion, conditions should very much be part of the deal. The countries involved should be the poorest ones, to start with. They should have a democratic government and a pluriform parliament which keeps the government in check. The country must fight corruption actively. The countries concerned should not be at war or participate in wars, and an agreed proportion of the budget must really be spent on social schemes for the poorest citizens, and must be invested in education, health care and social security. I do not agree with Mr Da Costa who said a moment ago that this might be somewhat neo-colonial. It was even agreed in Copenhagen, at the Social Summit for developing countries which was held there a while ago, that a proportion was to be spent on those costs. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we should really call for something to be done about this. We should simply spend 10% of the total development budget on cancelling these debts. If we do nothing, the countries will remain trapped in a downward spiral. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group considers that the debt which blights the development of the world’s poorest countries cannot be dealt with in isolation, as a purely financial problem, but it must be dealt with within the framework of a broad and coherent strategy which, through the eradication of poverty, leads to development.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, firstly, the cancellation of debt must not involve the removal of other sources of finance, but cancellation must be one more measure in a coherent development policy. Secondly, the funds made available through the cancellation of debt must be used for human development funds, particularly for investment in health and education. I do not agree with the Council when it says that this may mean a new form of colonisation. I do not believe that to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be effective, in development terms, the cancellation of debt also requires, as we request in the resolution, a global strategy implemented in unison in and by the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as a major contributor of development aid, must coordinate its action in this regard and make the elimination of poverty the common objective of its Member States, one aspect of this being the cancellation of debt in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore an example of the need for coherence and coordination between Community policies. The common foreign and security policy, which we too often treat as just a security policy, must address this issue as well as commercial and development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The highly-indebted poor countries, who are the beneficiaries of this debt cancellation strategy that has already been adopted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must commit themselves to suitable macroeconomic policies, to social development objectives, to increase the credibility of the state, which is the only way to attract foreign investment, and to strengthen their institutional capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">By uniting the actions of debtors and creditors in a global strategy aimed at the elimination of poverty, it is possible that we will achieve objective 15 of the Copenhagen Summit on social development, which is an objective which we fully identify with.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore strongly urge all Member States and the Commission to support the international financial institutions’ HIPC initiative for highly indebted poor countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this inspired policy comes too late, far too late. As early as the late eighties, UNICEF stated that the rich obtained the loans in the Third World and the poor were saddled with the debts, and UNICEF was right. </p>
<p class="contents">According to Oxfam, there are 19 000 children who die daily in the developing countries as a result of the debt burden and as an indirect result, admittedly, of the IMF programmes which require certain countries to cut down their health care expenditure by one third. Is it not mind-boggling that countries sometimes have to spend up to 40% of their budget on paying off debts, which have often been accumulated by irresponsible and avaricious dictators, with the unspoken collaboration of the World Bank and private western banks? </p>
<p class="contents">Let us learn from past experience. I am in favour of debt reduction but not on a level repayment or unconditional basis. It should feature as part of an integrated and multi-lateral strategy. It must be accompanied by proper management requirements. These requirements must be followed by hard guarantees from the countries involved: guarantees that the funding made available by cancelling debts is used to fight poverty; guarantees that the funding will no longer be used to finance arms deals and other military activities. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Da Costa, that is not neo-colonialism in my book. It is making sure that the funds of the European taxpayer are not misused to fund wars – crazy wars – in Africa. Conditionality requires courage and – you will have to forgive me – more courage than the Member States and the Commission have displayed so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all the headlines that we heard at Cologne last year, less than $13 billion of the $100 billion promised has actually been cancelled and as the Commission and the Council have told us, contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund are still way below target. As the Commissioner rightly says, the burden deserves to be shared. The fact is that despite a $1 trillion budget surplus over 10 years, President Clinton is not able to squeeze $210 million for HIPC out of Congress. That is an appalling fact for us to take on board.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that we are still waiting for the World Bank and the IMF to come up with something similar to the European Union. All G7 countries have promised some form of 100% debt cancellation, but many of them are very slow and disinclined to do it in the way that we would like. Also, to qualify for debt relief, each country has to complete a long and often contradictory ‘HIPC’ process, and only 5 countries have so far managed to go through the hoops that they are being asked to go through.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the United Kingdom is the only country that has offered 100% debt cancellation. France, Germany and Japan only include pre-cut-off debts and so ignore a significant portion of debt. Japan, incidentally, ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy Japanese exports.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mozambique, for instance, it is very significant that the IMF, the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what I would say, finally, is that we in this Parliament urge all the creditors to stop delaying and to start working really hard towards fulfilling full debt cancellation for the poorest countries. Of course, I agree with all my colleagues, the poorest countries who fulfil the criteria of delivering debt relief to those countries that show a commitment to social sector and human development support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is essentially an issue on which there is a degree of agreement, particularly within the European Union. The Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has furthermore taken care to include this issue in its working programme and has ensured that it was a key part of the agenda of the Cairo Euro-African summit. This issue must, however, be considered calmly and carefully, without any histrionics, given the serious situation that the populations of the highly indebted countries find themselves in.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental issue of debt is not the central issue for these countries – the main issue is their development, and this is the key point behind all this. We must all be aware that what is currently at stake is the global debate on general development policy and, in particular, on the role of the European Union and its Member States in defining this policy at world level. This is the crucial issue: debt is a symptom but underdevelopment is the disease. There are indeed problems of inequality and of the uneven distribution of wealth in these countries, but these problems must be overcome through political solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke just now about the temptation or tendency to adopt a neo-colonial approach, but I was by no means implying that some aid conditions – a subject which is in fact influenced by the current philosophy behind ACP-EU cooperation – are not perfectly legitimate and acceptable. What we must not forget is that there is a code of conduct for the internal management of resource allocation, and in particular for resources released for these countries as debt relief. We must be reasonably careful to find a way to respect the right of these countries’ governments to manage these funds. We must understand that we have to endeavour to ensure that political conditionality and the strengthening of democracy in these countries are the key factors underpinning our action. Working towards good governance and working towards strengthening democratic structures and political participation are vital factors in creating free societies which provide for better management of internal resources and more appropriate management of wealth distribution and, in particular, which do not encourage corruption and the siphoning-off of funds. It is our opinion that these issues are fundamentally linked to development. As I said, the issue of debt is a symptom of a much more global issue, namely development. I think that the European Union and the Member States have demonstrated that they are mindful of the problems in this field and that they have concrete measures to propose in order to address them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with a number of the contributions here. I would also say that what we are facing here is not a tighter regime of conditionality than what Member States are actually pursuing in their bilateral development cooperation, as nowadays it is necessary to ensure that the use of resources corresponds to the goals that are set.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the substance, it is also the link to focusing better on social aspects in the HIPC countries – that is the key to what they have to do. There is also evidence of this being taken up by the World Bank and the IMF, with those institutions coming on board in terms of giving priority to these aspects. In a way, one could say that we are witnessing a move from the Washington consensus to the Copenhagen consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The good part of this is that the IMF, with the poverty reduction strategy papers, is aligning itself with the goals the World Bank set a few years ago. All this shows that the fight against poverty is at the centre of this effort. So the combination of keeping the focus on perhaps narrowly defined HIPC countries and looking at the social consequences inside those countries is quite reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the matter of whether too few countries are part of the initiative. It would be wrong to think that we could simply broaden its scope and welcome all developing countries to it. There would be a number of adverse effects if we did so. Firstly, the cost of the HIPC initiative would increase dramatically because the wealthier these countries are, or the less poor, the bigger the debt they have acquired. So it must be borne in mind that this has to do with helping the poorest countries to determine those areas in which they can manage the remaining debt. The idea was never to cancel all debt from the Third World countries because that was totally impracticable. We are at a level of 0.22% or 0.23% for official development assistance, far from the 0.7% target that in principle everybody has agreed to and which only a limited number of countries have actually reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The 350bn would not be a manageable figure, and also the value for the poorest countries would be watered down if it were shared amongst the less poor middle-income countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mrs Schörling that almost all money for HIPC is found from the existing development budgets. This is also the case for the billion of EDF money we are reallocating. The nice thing about it is that the ACP countries accepted it, and this is a reallocation that moves money from the relatively better-off to the poorest countries in the ACP group. So we are doing something very concrete by improving the poverty focus of our general activity in this reallocation. That part of it is highly welcome. The good thing is that we had the money so we were able to do something of real value as the only donor around, except for a few elite donors who are trying to shame the rest by moving forward and setting a good example – the usual gang. Otherwise, the European Union is the only one able to do something of real value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome very much the way this debate has gone. Parliament's interest is an important asset for the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
