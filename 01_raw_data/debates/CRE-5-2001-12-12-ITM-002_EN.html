<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boumediene-Thiery (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit have given new impetus to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. With a view to attaining the objectives that were set, a plan of action was drawn up, which provides for its establishment between two and five years after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force. It is now time for a mid-term review of the progress made on the Tampere agenda, in the light of the Commission’s timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of security, freedom and justice covers three major aspects: the Community’s asylum and immigration policy, strengthening judicial cooperation and police cooperation. So let us look at the situation regarding each of these three aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of asylum and immigration policy and, more specifically, the management of migration flows, under the measures that have been taken, immigration is regarded as a palliative for manpower shortages and as compensation for the demographic imbalances of the states involved, without taking account of the human or social dimension or the consequences of the brain drain. However, surely this Community migration policy calls into question the universal nature of fundamental rights?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the re-admission policy consistent with international obligations regarding the protection of refugees and the right of asylum? As for the European Observatory on Migration, I have a reservation. Surely we have to admit that first of all we need to reflect on its purpose, its usefulness and the position of the NGOs concerned with migration in this Observatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Not a single significant measure has been taken to ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly. As for their political participation and the re-definition of citizenship, this question has been evaded on the pretext of protecting national sovereignty, which comes down to denying the democratic rights of citizens resident in Europe. How does the Commission propose to promote citizenship based on residence as a means of ensuring their rights? Furthermore, what action does the Council propose to take on the directives on reuniting families, on the status of non-Europeans who are long-term residents and on freedom of movement, establishment and work on the territory of the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">The Geneva Convention forms the basis of asylum policy. However, the concept of refugee must encompass both the gender aspect and the social aspect. Is the Council prepared to respond to the specific sufferings of women and victims of civil war? Surely the Eurodac system, based on a data bank of fingerprints, presents a risk to asylum seekers? Furthermore, should the Dublin Convention not be reviewed? The competence of a state to examine a file and the decision-making responsibility should be decided on the basis of the asylum seeker’s choice of country of residence rather than by the country of arrival, which is so difficult to decide in a Union that has supposedly abolished borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plans adopted for partnership with third countries are looking more and more like a means of holding back immigration. What is the situation regarding development aid, a corollary to restricting emigration? Has cooperation been reduced to financing extradition? Surely the introduction of administrative police at the points of entry from third countries is a negation of the right to seek asylum? Some progress has been made at civil level, in relation to strengthening judicial cooperation. Several texts have been adopted on judicial powers, the notification of acts, the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and their enforcement, especially in the matrimonial field and in relation to parental responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal for a directive on legal aid is under consideration; it aims to secure better access to justice. The situation is much less promising with regard to reinforcing criminal judicial cooperation: the reservations here are mainly about what constitutes a specific offence. In the legislative field, framework decisions have been taken on protecting the euro against forgeries, money-laundering, combating the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also appears to be preparing to adopt those decisions that concern the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant. The slow progress is due mainly to Member States’ resistance to the principle of mutual recognition. The setting up of Eurojust is a real step forward for the citizens; the rights of defendants and the protection of data do, however, need better guarantees. Unfortunately, we find that we are still far from establishing a European public prosecutor’s office or from common legislation and judicial procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the most marked progress in the field of police cooperation. There are now many areas where the police have to cooperate. The procedures for Europol’s participation in joint investigations, for the keeping of its records and for its cooperation with third countries need to be clearly defined. Surely we urgently need to guarantee better data protection and finally ensure that we have democratic and judicial scrutiny? As for respect for fundamental rights, I believe we need to review the list of safe countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Schengen Information System, and looking ahead to the enlargement of the Union, new questions arise concerning its tasks, its technical capacity and its institutional form.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not overlook the external dimension of justice and home affairs. The fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against organised crime are both areas that should be dealt with under the external relations aspect of justice and home affairs.</p>

Different reports have been put together into an omnibus debate.</p>
<p class="contents">My report deals with the question of security at summits of the European Union and similar international gatherings and it looks also at the question of citizens' rights. It is important that when Parliament looks at problems that affect the Union, it must do so without victimising individual countries. Just as my recent report on terrorism sought to be a generic report and not one that referred exclusively to the situation in the Basque country in Spain, so this report sets out also to be a generic report and not one that seeks to be particularly critical of any one country.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen violent protests at summits in EU countries – in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa. Such protests have been serious, in the last instance resulting in a death. My report has been drawn up in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs and I am pleased to say that it has enjoyed a wide consensus in that committee. I thank my colleagues for the work they have put into it and recommend that they adopt the report as it stands, and vote against the 30 amendments which have been submitted, which seem to me to relate to issues that have already been dealt with in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In looking at the problems of violence that we have seen, the European Union must understand the causes of such violent protest and seek to prevent it. There seem to me to be two requirements in this. The first is that we must improve political dialogue on the right to peaceful assembly and to peaceful protest. The second is that we must find a firm, but proportionate, response to criminal behaviour by demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that in Sweden and in Italy judicial proceedings have followed from the violent protests that we saw. The European Union, too, needs to look at whether citizens' rights have been violated, particularly in reference to Article 6 (1) and to Article 7 of our treaties. It must be recalled that Article 7 was strengthened by the European Council in Nice, which instructed the European institutions to monitor the application of fundamental rights even where there is simply a risk of a violation of them. In carrying out such surveillance, institutions must be guided by the European Charter on Fundamental Rights. Hence my report seeks to begin such a study of what has happened and look at whether we have in all cases abided by our commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">When hundreds of thousands of people representing NGOs and church groups gather on the streets to express their concern and choose to do so at a series of international meetings, it is not just a coincidence. It demands an appropriate response and, indeed, a political response. We must avoid a situation where no answer is given because a society where citizens are afraid of their institutions – and perhaps more importantly institutions are afraid of their citizens – makes for a very weak democracy. In this context I welcome the démarche taken by Mr Guy Verhofstadt in seeking to engage in dialogue with civil society, in advance of the meetings that have been held under the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach needs to be complemented by a White Paper dealing with globalisation, looking at the European Union's position as a major actor in an area for which the Union is directly responsible and perhaps bringing together a number of Commissioners from different disciplines to look at a global strategy for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must look at Article 33 of the Treaty, which gives Member States the task of ensuring the maintenance of law and order, and see whether the responses have been appropriate. The weakness in cooperation between the Member States' law and order authorities is a fundamental weakness of the Union. I hope that we will be able to examine this in the context of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens must know that they will receive the same treatment from authorities and enjoy the same rights under the law, whichever country they are in and wherever they are exercising their democratic rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is unfortunate for you, but I hope you will excuse me and excuse her.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the Laeken Summit, Mrs Hazan said she was very pleased to have the opportunity to present this report on the Union’s priorities and policy objectives for external relations in the field of justice and home affairs and to play a larger part in this debate on the progress made in relation to the area of security, freedom and justice since the Tampere Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is at a crossroads. We must not arrive late for this rendezvous that is so crucial and strategic to its future unless we want to end up one day with our back to the wall. Moreover, we now have an opportunity to examine the degree to which the Member States are willing to put justice and home affairs in the forefront of the Union’s policies. That is the purpose of this report, which highlights the need to fully integrate issues relating to asylum, immigration, justice and police cooperation, i.e. issues of very direct concern to our fellow citizens. With that in mind, all the Member States will have to take global, integrated and inter-pillar action. We must also stress the fact that hitherto the European Union has taken too little action in this field, which is still in its early days. This kind of report must be seen above all as providing food for thought on the added value of deepening the area of security, freedom and justice that is at the very heart of the Union, so that the Union can be prepared to meet the challenges of an external policy in this field. It is up to us to establish the necessary instruments, a lack of which has meant that we have hitherto been unable to respond to our partners’ demands. Some of these objectives have been listed. They concern the following areas: combating all forms of organised crime, forming a common front against terrorism, coordination amongst Member States and candidate countries as regards training for the judiciary and police authorities, establishing a co-development policy, establishing close forms of cooperation with third countries in fighting racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination, establishing a strong link between immigration policy and development aid policy, the need to adopt a common asylum policy containing minimum standards for the reception and temporary protection of asylum seekers. This is a difficult task, which will take a long time and calls for complex international negotiations. By that token we must give the Union a mandate to take action to achieve this, by supporting the Commission proposals that do and will play their part in establishing this kind of coherent framework. In this sort of situation, we have to be bold enough to put our foot on the accelerator and ensure that decisions that are still blocked in the Council can enter into force. Obstacles do exist and we must do our best to overcome them. We must not overlook the human implications of these problems. Current events remind us of that, with the terrible tragedy of the eight refugees, including three children, found dead in a container in Ireland last Saturday. We also remember the 58 victims found at Dover in June 2000. I hope it will not take other tragedies of this kind for our States to realise how important it is to make progress in these areas. The Council must, of course, assume its responsibilities, because what is happening here is the result of its overcautious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by any one country – I am referring to Italy – but I believe that yesterday’s events have changed things and Mrs Hazan cannot have known about this last night.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the tragic events of 11 September make it even more necessary for us to look at these matters from a long-term point of view. We must not now adopt an overly hasty position out of a sense of urgency. On the contrary, only if Europe is equipped with instruments that are permanent, operational and coordinated to a similar degree can it exert its influence on the international scene and impose its vision of humanism and the protection of individual freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we emphasise that Parliament must be able to exercise control over external policy and justice and home affairs policy by means of periodic consultation regarding the overall strategy pursued. Let me point out that this is not so much a question of making unrealistic and well-meaning proposals and but rather of analysing the situation objectively, which means we must look at this external dimension as a key part of our policy. The progress made since Tampere is not very encouraging. Whose fault is that? It is certainly not the fault of the Commission, which is making a great effort to achieve these objectives. Instead, we should criticise the Council, which tends too often to put off the adoption of specific measures again and again, and the unanimity rule governing these areas, which blocks their adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, none of this is new, as you know, since this question was also raised at the Tampere Summit. Today, we must seize the moment...</p>

Organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and terrorism are phenomena that no longer permit us to continue to think in national or regional terms. It is therefore by no means too late for the European Union to apply its policy on justice and home affairs to its external relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs we have noticed that there are more and more reports relating to cross-border problems, and Eurojust is only one example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The reinforcement or even the preservation of the constitutional state and democracy in the European Union is determined to a large extent by the situation in the countries surrounding us and those further away. A significant factor in this is the visible and invisible corruption that is particularly problematic in a number of countries and which is undermining our democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus an efficient and responsible immigration and asylum policy cannot be achieved without appropriate efforts for the countries of origin. However, in order to achieve a good understanding of the causes of migration and asylum applications, we must match our development policy to the actual socio-economic and political context in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal by the Council, in collaboration with the Commission, is an important document that is pointing in the right direction. The principle of the constitutional state is being reinforced, both in the area of enlargement and in that of the European Union’s collaboration with other countries, and we should now be aiming to achieve proper coordination in our external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With her report, Mrs Hazan has furthermore managed to reinforce the original text. Naturally, the objectives, priorities and measures being proposed will still have to be achieved and complied with. It is also important that Parliament be kept properly informed about progress in this regard, because we have to be able to answer the question that concerns the man and woman on the street: ‘What are you doing to solve all these problems?’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, today’s debate in this Chamber is taking place in a particular international context, which only underlines the need, the urgent need, to achieve the objectives of the Amsterdam Treaty and to respect the programme set out by the Heads of State and Government of the EU countries in Tampere in 1999. It is also taking place in the context of yesterday’s Justice and Home Affairs Council whose heavy agenda reflected the intensive nature of the ongoing work, and of the forthcoming Laeken Summit, a mid-term meeting to evaluate the progress made since Tampere and, I hope, give new impetus to our efforts to bring our programme to fruition. Finally, it looks forward to the medium-term prospect of the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2004, against the background of the enlargement of the Union. Some of the questions that have been raised, especially on the role of the European Parliament in the field of justice and home affairs and on protecting the citizen’s fundamental rights in the European judicial area, will figure very largely on the agenda of that debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting, therefore, with the questions put by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, I will try to reply to the questions of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question raised touches on a matter of principle: the objective of protecting the citizens, laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty. It is a question that stands at the top of the Union’s political agenda, in the light of the current, dramatic international events and of deadlines that are drawing increasingly near, such as enlargement. I would say that this objective will certainly not prejudice respect for the fundamental rights set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Commission is most concerned to ensure that the proposals put forward for guaranteeing internal security and the protection of our fellow citizens are balanced and proportionate and are consistent with a system of values based first and foremost on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a number of quasi-constitutional texts guarantee these rights in the European Union and are referred to systematically in the Commission’s proposals. This applies to the European Convention on Human Rights as also to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. These texts govern the rights of the Union as they do national rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe it is imperative to point out that the Union’s objectives with regard to the protection of citizens are not just consistent with the fundamental rights set out in the EU Charter but are based on these rights. In that sense, we welcome the recommendations made in the Watson report on demonstrations organised in conjunction with the European Council. These recommendations are reasonable and we believe they create a balance between, on the one hand, the citizens’ freedom of expression and their full use of the fundamental right to demonstrate and, on the other hand, the need not to give free rein to those who are in fact against any democratic debate and believe they can pass on their messages by means of violent confrontation with the forces of law and order.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the recommendation to launch a dialogue on the internal and external impact of globalisation, let me say that the same concern will be apparent in the communication the Commission will be submitting next January on the external aspects of a sustainable development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the second point, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery’s question about the possibility of taking special measures to combat the threat of terrorism, I do not think one could say the European Union is going down that road. Once again, although it is true that to some extent it is urgent to take decisions, and in particular measures to strengthen police and judicial cooperation to combat the most serious attacks on our freedoms, our values and our institutions, I do not believe that the initiatives the European Union has taken or has proposed can be described as special measures, i.e. as measures derogating from key principles because of special circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">No, the proposed measures are basic measures; they were taken, it is true, in special circumstances, but they are not makeshift measures and they are in fact consistent with the mandate our governments and our nations conferred on us when they adopted the Amsterdam Treaty. Let me also take this opportunity to express my pleasure and my congratulations to the Belgian Presidency for managing, yesterday in Rome, to consolidate decisions taken by the Justice and Home Affairs Council to adopt the framework decision on combating terrorism and the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s suggestion that we should include a temporary validity clause or a review clause is interesting in principle, i.e. the idea of introducing an obligation to assess the impact of a proposal adopted in terms of its objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point that was emphasised concerns the delay in achieving the Tampere objectives. The speaker is addressing all the institutions and authorities responsible for implementing the programme decided at Tampere. The latest edition of the Commission’s programme includes an initial evaluation of the progress made. Delays have indeed occurred, especially in certain areas such as asylum and immigration or the minimal harmonisation of penal sanctions. As you know, the mid-term review that will take place at the Laeken European Council is therefore a crucial step. That will be the moment to check whether the commitments made in Tampere and reiterated on 21 September will be reflected by a real will on the part of the Member States to move ahead. It will also be the moment to learn lessons from the successes achieved and difficulties encountered to date. If the Tampere objectives were re-evaluated and, in particular, if the deadlines that were set were called into question again, we would see a crisis of public confidence vis-à-vis a political project, which, as everyone well knows, is essential and a matter of priority, whatever the remaining difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we need today is resolve as much as method, in order not to disappoint public opinion’s legitimate expectations as also the men and women whose job it is to protect our freedom, guarantee our security and ensure that justice becomes more accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held last week produced encouraging results in terms of the Member States’ resolve to match the commitments they made with their actions. However, it also illustrated all the limitations and ambiguities of a decision-making process based entirely on unanimity. In Laeken, the Commission will underline the fact that we can only overcome the reluctance to move forward if we begin by injecting a new dose of political will. When the Heads of State and Government embark on a new, more general debate on the future of Europe at the Laeken Summit, that will also be the time to establish a link between the progress achieved, the progress still to be made and the future of the Union and of the way it functions. They will have to reflect on how the next Intergovernmental Conference could introduce institutional changes and reform the decision-making mechanisms in such a way as to ensure the full achievement of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question concerns harmonisation in the field of criminal law. First of all, let me remind you that the Treaty refers specifically to the harmonisation of criminal law as such. The object here is not so much to achieve mutual recognition as to make sure the EU Member States combat acts that affect all the countries of the Union in a coordinated manner, in the same manner and by imposing penalties of equivalent severity. This will be an instrument that complements the mutual recognition of judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as I have always said and will repeat today, harmonisation must be handled with sensitivity and applied only where it is necessary. The Tampere European Council listed the sectors where this rapprochement is needed. There have been Member State initiatives or Commission proposals covering all these aspects. Several of them have been adopted, others are well on the way to being so and I believe I can say that we will soon have a common set of instruments to fulfil this mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding procedural law, however, I have already had occasion to say that the Commission intends to present a communication on this subject, which has become all the more necessary in the light of the most interesting political debate on the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this communication would be to define common standards for the protection of individual rights in criminal proceedings in relation to a number of aspects that derive from the Convention on Human Rights and the Strasbourg Court’s case law. This approach would help strengthen the mutual trust on which the construction of the European judicial area depends, both in the Union as it is today and, later, in a Europe enlarged to 25 or 30 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth point concerns the democratic deficit that still exists within the Union in fields relating to justice and home affairs. This is a dual question, since it concerns, firstly, your institution’s role in the decision-making process in the field of justice and home affairs, and secondly, how it can exercise its powers in the appropriate manner. It is very important to ensure that our resolve to make progress in achieving our objectives goes hand in hand with improved democratic and judicial scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I must say that over these past two years the Commission has endeavoured to inform and involve the European Parliament as closely as possible in the definition of its strategic guidelines and its initiatives. Nonetheless, it remains true that we need to think more deeply about Parliament’s participation not only in defining the Union’s strategy but also in its implementation. The Commission regards this as a key point with regard to the progress remaining to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainstreaming matters that come under the first pillar with those regarded as coming under the third pillar is proving a source of constant difficulties. Moreover, there is some risk that this situation could block the decision-making process; even if this risk is overcome at the price of artificially separating acts that in fact have the same aim, this deadlock would make the Union’s action unintelligible to the citizens. I therefore welcome the Council recommendation, which your Parliament adopted on 15 November this year, on criminal sanctions and Community law, calling for, at the very least, the communitarisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Parliament’s access to sensitive information held by the Commission, one of the practical conditions allowing your institution to exercise its right of scrutiny properly, let me point out that a framework agreement, dated 5 July, exists between our two institutions and that the Commission will apply it to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery asked about strengthening the candidate countries’ institutional capacities. I believe that in the reports we have published and in our constant evaluation of the improvement in the candidate countries’ capacities, we have borne this in mind and given all the necessary publicity to our evaluation of each of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the enhanced cooperation between the Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism, I believe this cooperation shows the extent to which the European dimension cannot now be dissociated from any complete and effective international action taken against transnational incidents. Of course, this cooperation is still in its fairly early days. It has given rise to problems, especially in guaranteeing full respect for the principles of our European law and of international law. I see the development of this European dimension as an opportunity to assert our values and our principles rather than sacrificing our principles on the altar of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, Mr President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the Union’s response to the challenges and issues of our times must be well considered but rapid, transparent but effective, progressive but coordinated. It is along these lines that I see the future of that vast building site, which is the area of freedom, security and justice, and that I intend to pursue the cooperative relations with the European Parliament on which we embarked two and a half years ago. I personally am very grateful for the commitment of all the members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and above all its chairman, Graham Watson, to whom I offer particularly warm thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we briefly review the past year in flashback, we can clearly see that we have, as rarely before, made progress in the area of internal security, even before 11 September. We have laid down the political guidelines on immigration and asylum policy; we have drafted detailed regulations; we have, in these areas, taken steps to deal with illegal immigration and also prepared for intensive judicial cooperation; and, after lengthy discussions, have even implemented a directive on money laundering. Progress has been made; it was heavy going, but we succeeded in moving ahead. We owe this in particular to the way Parliament and the Commission work so well together; they have led us to these very advances. Many thanks, Commissioner Vitorino!</p>
<p class="contents">There were more, indeed dramatic, developments after the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September. The Member States' ministers – both of justice and of home affairs – appear at last to have woken up, with the consequence that the counter-terrorism package, which instituted Europol's joint investigation teams, could be wrapped up with the sole exception of the European arrest warrant, and I wish to express congratulations to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President-in-Office Verhofstadt for having brought about a settlement that may eventually make it possible to implement the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The package of measures extends to the freezing of the money and other assets of suspicious organisations, as this will make it possible to sever the arteries of terrorism and organisations of a criminal nature. Renewed consideration, though, has led indirectly to greater security, one example being our most recent discussions here, in which we urged that a visa should in future be carried in exactly the same way as a residence permit, a document in its own right and unambiguously indicating the identity of the bearer. This is a plus for security, an added value which we have achieved through our discussions here.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern must, however, be with pressing the Member States to speedily implement all the measures we have decided on. I would, though, also like to use this opportunity to highlight some less positive developments. The working conditions in this House are, as a rule, among them. Cooperation with the Council leaves something to be desired. It is increasingly the case that documents are presented too late or not at all, resulting in Parliament and the committees discussing castles in the air. In important committee meetings, but also in the plenary sittings, the Council is frequently conspicuous by its absence. Monday was the classic example; in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we met specifically to have important debates on the European arrest warrant and on cooperation with the United States, which involved an exchange of letters between Presidents Bush and Prodi. The Council distinguished itself by not being present, and there was no written material for discussion. Putting it mildly, that is unacceptable from the point of view of cooperation here.</p>
<p class="contents">Take one look at the timetables and you will know that they result in impossible working conditions. We are increasingly getting documents at the last moment. This is not on. We want to make speedy progress, but not at the expense of quality.</p>

This report reflects on the need to respond politically to the problems posed by globalisation in order to contribute to the political, social and economic progress of the international community and to overcome violence. Too many acts of violence have been committed during the anti-globalisation demonstrations, and also in some cases too many acts of violence against the demonstrators or even those arrested, as in the tragic events in Genoa in which a young man was killed, struck down in circumstances that are still unclear. I am glad to say that the courts in my country are independent and still able to mete out justice, even if it is posthumous. There have been too many acts of violence, too many violations of the rules and principles that govern the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When faced with alarming events, we must not give up respecting the fundamental rights which we solemnly affirm and expect third countries that have barely entered the democratic arena to respect. Even today, when we are faced with terrorism, we must remember that these rights were won in Europe with the greatest difficulty. They cannot just apply on holidays and in times of peace. They exist to protect us in times of struggle and danger. Therefore, ready as we are to defend ourselves against terrorists, enemies of human rights, by every lawful means, we reject any temptation to use instruments that reduce the levels of civilisation on which we pride ourselves, even when faced with pressing, genuine demands. The end does not justify the means, especially when it is the means – respect for the fundamental rights of every human being, and the rejection of discrimination between citizens and non-citizens – that form the essence of our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this parliamentary term, the Europe of rights is being constructed. The Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been approved and appreciable progress has been made in setting up the area of freedom, security and justice. We are behind schedule with asylum and immigration but we have made progress on judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and police cooperation. The delays in Member States ratifying the agreements approved by the Council reveal the need for the Community method even in matters of the so-called third pillar. The strengthening of Europol, the creation of Eurojust, joint investigation teams and the fight against money laundering are just a few of the agreed objectives that are still waiting to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The 11 September slaughter gave rise to the proposal of framework decisions on a joint definition of the crimes of terrorism and on the European arrest warrant. After incomprehensible resistance from – I regret to say – my own government, even the latter project is about to be implemented, and I hope my government does not make the country pay for its contradictions in this matter. In any case, I am glad to say that the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice really will be here soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to talk specifically about the Council statement which we are expecting on cooperation between the EU and the USA and cooperation in combating terrorism. The events of 11 September were an excruciating flash of light and we had to react immediately. However, we must not be blinded into forgetting that terrorism has been a problem on our continent for many years. After 11 September, I remember Hans Gert Poettering saying here in a memorable debate 'we are all Americans', but we have learned since then that we must first be Europeans. I welcome the Justice and Home Affairs Council's agreement at the weekend on a framework decision on combating terrorism. I welcome the Council's recognition of a European Union legal base for the freezing of assets of groups linked to terrorism and, in particular, yesterday's agreement between Council President Guy Verhofstadt and Prime Minister Berlusconi on a European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has put its house in order. Europe has shown its capacity to act. In tackling terrorism there is a fine balance to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the rights and freedoms which make democracy what it is. The European Union has shown that it can be tough on terrorism and still be true to its treaties and to the values which underpin them. It has recognised that networks of terrorism stretch beyond its borders and that we need cooperation between democracies, particularly across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step must be an agreement on better cooperation with the United States. Articles 24 and 28 of the TEU allow us to build a cooperation agreement on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters with our friends in North America. We note that there is a famous exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Verhofstadt – some 40 US proposals on what we could be doing to improve our capacity to fight against terrorism. Most of these can be and I believe are being complied with. Some of them cause a few doubts since the US appears to be asking for things which it does not require in its own laws, such as retention of traffic data. Yet others highlight a difference of legal culture between our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">On a visit to Washington DC last week, in talks with senators, congressmen and members of the Administration, I was concerned to learn that the US Patriot Act, adopted by the United States to fight terrorism, appears to discriminate against non-US citizens. We will need to explore with our American friends quite how it affects those from the European Union. I was struck too at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of Attorney General John Ashcroft by the way in which the proposal for military tribunals – the executive order from the President – would provide for hearings in secret, for a prosecution being able to withhold evidence from the defence, for defendants not necessarily having the right to an independent lawyer or to a private conversation with their lawyer, and by how a sentence – including a death sentence – can be passed by a majority of two-thirds of the jurors. Even if we were able to get an agreement on an extradition package in which the US would not apply the death penalty, the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all of our Member States are signatories and on which the Union is founded, would prevent extradition of suspects to appear before such military tribunals.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, in Europe, we have developed a rights-based approach to international law. We would like a permanent international criminal court to try those guilty of crimes against humanity and we have called on the Americans to join us in that. We recognise that democracies need to work together in the fight against terrorism and other forms of serious cross-border crime. My fear is that, if the US goes down the path of military tribunals, we are on divergent paths. We must make that clear to Mr Ashcroft on his visit to Europe later this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasingly often, these authorities close borders indiscriminately and unlawfully, expel citizens with a clean record (as recently happened to a Swedish citizen, a member of a non-governmental organisation, who was expelled a few days ago from Belgium on no real grounds), and arrest defenceless demonstrators and subject them to unacceptable procedures, if not torture and terrible violence, as happened in Genoa.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be possible that there is nothing we can do? How can it be that, with all the debates we have had on rights, on respect for dissent and the freedom to demonstrate, with all the talk on the Europe of the citizens, this same Europe is unable to take any action alongside the national courts? The merit of the Watson report is precisely that it shows the way for Europe to stop being mute. The open statement that Schengen has often been violated and that this must not happen again; the threat to the freedom of the individual from secret, illegally compiled blacklists; the need to penalise, not least through international instruments, the disproportionate use of force by police forces; the ban on discrimination between European citizens: all this, which is contained in the Watson report, is the plan of work for this Parliament, which, unlike the other parliaments in the Member States, manages to find a spirit of true unity on these matters. I hope it is also the Commission’s agenda, and I hope that this plan of work will succeed in preventing the horrors we have seen in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa, and will be an important contribution to all the measures being taken against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 7 December 2000, at Nice, we signed, proclaimed and upheld the Charter of European Citizens’ Rights. It is very clearly stated in Article 2, under the heading of dignity, that nobody may be condemned to death or be executed; the Charter thus makes a clear distinction between the two things and states that, for us European citizens, a prohibition on being executed is not enough and a prohibition on being condemned to death is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we are committing ourselves to cooperation with the United States, which has kept the death penalty, condemns people to death and applies the death penalty, has a justice system that uses military courts, and detains thousands of Arabs without charge and without defence. We are about to vote on a joint resolution with the other groups – we, of course, will vote against it – stating that extradition may be granted provided the United States guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied; that means that the United States courts may issue capital sentences provided they then refrain from applying them, and all that in spite of the Charter of civil, human and fundamental rights that we have been highlighting so much recently.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opening up an enormous breach in our defences against the death penalty. Friends from the People’s Party, Greens, Socialists, British Liberals, take care! We are saying we can extradite our citizens to be condemned to death in the United States even if that country then undertakes not to apply the sentence! It is a complete break with our tradition; it is a complete break with our commitment! Today, we heard Commissioner Vitorino give a speech full of references to our values and our principles. What, then, are our values and principles? Extradition to a country that will condemn European citizens to death? I appeal to your feelings, but also to your moral integrity. We must vote against this resolution! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Angelilli (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms has done some notable work in opening up a debate within the European Union Member States and thus assuring the highest security at European Council meetings and other similar events. Indeed, since the events of 11 September, the significance of these topics has increased enormously. Nevertheless, both the rationale underlying the organisation of these summits and the views of many of the peaceful demonstrators remain current.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important that international Summits should continue to be held regularly and, where possible, they should be expanded to include representatives of the Third World, as happened at the G8 summit in Genoa. Indeed, it is only through discussion, dialogue and, especially, the preparation of a genuine cooperation and development policy that the poverty and marginalisation of vast regions of the globe can be overcome. This is precisely why we do not share the extreme, though peaceful positions of those demonstrators who, in Genoa, called the validity of the Summits themselves into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the views of the so-called anti-globalisation movements, which are also topical and important; they are the views of those who imagine a development model with greater respect for people and the environment, those who imagine a more just society in which wealth is redistributed more fairly. That is why we should appreciate the innovative method introduced at the Genoa Summit by the Italian Government, which lined up a series of preliminary talks with the demonstration leaders in order to make participation in the Summit itself more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made quite clear, however, that there can be no tolerance for violent demonstrators. At Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa, some people, even politicians, succumbed to the temptation of seeking to justify violent behaviour. We should, rather, have the courage to condemn it unconditionally in every case, because, in addition to the views of the authorities and the views of the demonstrators, there are the views of the silent majority of European citizens, who want practical answers to the issues discussed at these Summits, and that is also thanks to the stimulus provided by the demonstrators, but without the unfortunate excesses and violence that completely devastated the city of Genoa.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to mention the views of many men and women in the forces of law and order who, every day throughout Europe, strive to deal with major and minor emergencies of public order and crime, often with inadequate resources. If, as happened in Genoa, some of them went too far, they should be identified and punished individually, but without a whole class of people who often risk their lives for the good of society being unjustly and undeservedly criminalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I congratulate the Italian Government and its Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and the Belgian Prime Minister for having reached that important agreement yesterday on the European arrest warrant. I hope this will be the first step towards European harmonisation on matters of justice, and especially an important precondition for a European political Constitution guaranteeing all European citizens the right to security, freedom and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, we are able to put names to the world’s most dangerous terrorists. What has for a long time been clear to some people is now, following the military operations of recent weeks and months, obvious to everyone. The terrorists who are most deliberately and effectively ravaging our planet and threatening world peace are the governments of the United States and Israel. Daily, these two governments combine in using their huge death-dealing military technology to wreak far greater destruction than any other of the countless terrorists of world history. Monstrosities of military technology, they practise terrorism in multiple senses of the word. For one thing, they leave their victims in precisely that state of desperation and impotence that creates fertile ground for reactions similar to Bin Laden’s. It is absolute power, economic and military, that creates terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is the psychological warfare that is in the process of doing away with the concepts of justice which Europeans usually regard as fundamental to the values to which we subscribe and which, specifically, are a defence against terrorism. Two months ago, the United States sent Mr Prodi a list of 40 different decisions which, according to the United States Government, should be taken by the EU and the Member States in order to satisfy the United States: surveillance, control, arrest with no counsel for the defence or court hearing provided, and the handing over of suspects for legal proceedings in the United States, involving military courts and the death penalty. On the last point, I entirely agree with Mr Di Lello. We must protest most vigorously against the handing over of suspects in any form as long as there is the possibility of the death penalty’s being carried out and as long as no guarantee can be given by the United States of its not being carried out. It has been shameful to see the way in which the institutions of the EU have complied with demands that are also aimed at abolishing our concepts of justice. What is at issue here is not military technology but politics and the defence of the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are also very worrying signs in a climate of passive habituation to such acts by exponents of Islamic fundamentalism in all the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European arrest warrant: what a great result for liberal Europe! Giuseppe Mazzini and the revolutionaries who breathed life into ‘Young Europe’ in 1840 will be turning in their graves at the thought of a Europe which before giving itself a democratic Constitution is already thinking of a European arrest warrant: necessary certainly for terrorist and criminal emergencies but certainly not for other areas. We autonomous Members see it as a dangerous sign and therefore we have addressed an open letter to all autonomous and independent movements that are fighting for the principles of freedom. Some Italian Members have spoken here to stigmatise our government’s behaviour regarding the events in Genoa: well, then, I should like to remind them of the serious acts of delinquency and hooliganism that the false anti-globalisation protesters in Genoa were responsible for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had focused primarily on the interim evaluation of Tampere, of the decisions and recommendations made there, and on the four priorities which we had chosen for our presidency, namely the conversion from pro-Eurojust to Eurojust; the fight against trafficking in human beings, not only by standardising the laws but also operationally in the field; the fight against the disappearance of children; and last but not least, the freezing of assets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, who could have guessed at the beginning of our activities that there would be two incidents which would have a decisive impact on some other choices which the Presidency had to make? More specifically, I am referring to the problems in Gothenburg which obliged us, as Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, to take measures to guarantee freedom of expression, and to secure the safety of citizens, states and also demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">Who would have thought that the events of 11 September would have had such a profound impact on our political attitudes, now that the framework decisions relating to the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant have seen the light of day and have experienced an accelerated genesis. All the same, I also offer my apologies on behalf of the Presidency for the fact that no one from the Presidency was present during your proceedings on Monday. However, I am sure you will understand that in the context of the European arrest warrant, which is a matter very close to our hearts and with which we are determined to make headway, we have taken every opportunity to continue our work in this area and, I may say, with some success, as we achieved the breakthrough yesterday, and the European arrest warrant has become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus particularly on some of your questions, which in my opinion were very appropriate. Firstly, the possibility of achieving the aim of the European Union, namely to create a high degree of security for our citizens in an area of freedom, security and justice, whilst – and this has also been clearly expressed by the various speakers – our fundamental rights as set out in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights are fully respected. The Council recognises that it is immensely important to fully respect fundamental rights in all areas in which it is active, particularly in the area concerned with guaranteeing the security of our citizens. I would like to illustrate this issue on the basis of two topical examples which I know have been the subject of intense discussion in your Parliament. I am referring in particular to the framework decisions relating to the definition of terrorism and the introduction of the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">In our response to the threat of terrorism, we need to be able to take effective measures quickly in order to demonstrate that Member States are capable of common action, whilst at the same time ensuring that decisions are made quickly, with top priority being given to our devotion to and constant vigilance in respect of the freedoms of our citizens. Our work has been done at top speed, but no one, and I would like to emphasise this, no one has ever been willing to sacrifice the quality of the texts in order to achieve rapid acceptance. By working enormously hard over the past three months we have succeeded in taking this justified endeavour into consideration, and in this regard I am particularly pleased with the input provided by the members of the Article 36 Committee. Furthermore, I understand the apprehension that some people initially expressed when they saw what we were doing in connection with the increased public concern about security after 11 September. I understand that this apprehension clearly played a role at times during the negotiations. I understand this fear and I admire the vigilance, but the outcome of our work and the compromises made by the Council of 6 and 7 December demonstrates that the Council never intended to sacrifice the rights in the European Charter, and I think that this is the only result that counts.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision on the combating of terrorism contains clear instructions for national legislators, which makes it impossible to interpret it in an unnecessarily repressive way. The obligation to honour these rights as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty has been added, as has the work we have done on the European arrest warrant. The preamble bears the traces of a well-considered advice by your Parliament which we took into account. Finally, these precautionary measures are rounded off by the political declaration of the Council included in the decision. It makes it clear that the decision does not relate to people whose actions are aimed at protecting or restoring democratic values, nor to those exercising their right to freedom of expression, even if they break the law when doing so. Our work is now complete, and last Thursday the Council reached a political agreement in respect of this framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">There are similar guarantees for the European arrest warrant. In addition to the explicit references to fundamental freedoms in the preamble, Article 1 contains the connection with Article 6 of the Treaty which I have just explained in respect of the previous instrument. That the 15 Member States ultimately reached agreement on the European arrest warrant is therefore only to be expected. Besides the developments that have resulted in the explicit integration of the fundamental guarantees in the European Charter, I would like to add that it is advisable not to lose sight of the future role that the Court of Justice of the European Communities will have to play in the bringing together of the guarantees and the fundamental rights, especially on a procedural level. In view of its pre-judicial competence, and taking into account the traditionally sensitive relationship between criminal law and fundamental rights, it goes without saying that the Court is ideally placed to perform a particularly important role which consists of harmonising the guarantees offered to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism, negotiations on an agreement with the USA in respect of Article 38 of the Treaty on the European Union concerning mutual legal assistance in criminal matters are on the agenda. At the moment we are still in a preparatory phase. This is a very important activity, and I am convinced that you will maintain your vigilance with regard to the protection of human rights in this area. As far as the points on extradition that could be stated in this agreement are concerned, I would like to draw attention to the European Union’s unchanging position regarding cooperation with countries in which the death penalty is still in force. Extradition cannot take place without the inviolable guarantee that the person will not receive the death sentence. The Council’s standpoint on the special military courts in the USA for crimes connected with terrorism is not yet known, but I can already tell you that certain delegations are of the opinion that this situation may entail considerable risks in the area of fundamental rights, particularly with regard to the right to fair treatment as set out in Articles 47 to 49 of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to come back to another delicate point, namely the possibility of reaching an agreement on proposals for which negotiations have now reached deadlock, which is preventing the set deadlines on the scoreboard from being met and is preventing the creation of the area of security, freedom and justice. The Council is aware that some negotiations on the proposals currently on the table are being postponed, albeit, I may say, primarily for impartial reasons. I do not have the impression that negotiations have reached deadlock per se. Instead, the Council noted that there were several reasons for this delay and in fact it took the necessary steps to ensure that these discussions could be put back on track. The blockades without doubt form one of the points of the Laeken debate and I think that this will give the evaluation of Tampere a boost, especially that part in which we have not yet managed to achieve as much progress as we would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I would like to draw your attention to the particular progress that we have made in legal matters in the extremely short time in which we have been in action. I think that a certain amount of quantitative and qualitative effort still lies before us, but I reiterate that everything we need to enable us to achieve this is in place, namely harmonisation of legislation, mutual recognition of court decisions and the creation of a number of European players. Concrete and decisive progress was made on all these levels in 2001. The framework resolutions on trafficking in human beings and the combating of terrorism in the area of harmonisation, the European arrest warrant in the area of mutual recognition, and Eurojust in respect of the players, are likewise elements which demonstrate the substantial progress we have made and which should enable us to achieve a truly European policy on criminal law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> On behalf of my colleague Antoine Duquesne, President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to bring you up-to-date with regard to the progress of the files I know are close to your hearts, namely asylum and immigration. I have already told you that the progress in this area does not meet our expectations. Nonetheless we must remain objective. We have achieved a breakthrough during the course of this year. Both the Swedish and the current Belgian Presidency have made efforts to achieve progress in these affairs, which are particularly sensitive. These efforts have not been fruitless. Various basic texts, such as the visa regulation and the Eurodac regulations, the directive on temporary protection and the European Refugee Fund have been approved in this manner. However, it is clear that if we want to adhere to the deadlines set in the Treaty as well as at the Tampere Summit, we will have to redouble our efforts and make it even clearer that subjects such as managing the immigration flows, asylum policy and family reunification will have to take on a European perspective. I think that we still have a very great deal to do in this area, but you can be sure that the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, just like you yourself, are as keen as you are to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Please also allow me to pause at another subject that has also been touched on briefly, namely the question of whether the fact that numerous arrangements and international agreements, particularly those relating to the prevention and combating of organised crime, have not been ratified by the Member States, is being taken into account in the acceptance of measures. The Council is aware of this matter. The Council forums regularly examine the ratification situation and try to make it clear to delegations that it is absolutely essential that the decisions be rapidly enforced. However, the Council realises that every Member State wants to achieve a ratification procedure that fits in with its own constitutional requirements. This matter is also on the agenda as part of the evaluation of the implementation of the Tampere conclusions. I am sure that the conclusions of the Laeken summit will demonstrate how important the Council considers this matter to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has established that national procedures have been speeded up, and that almost all Member States have completed the ratification procedure for some instruments; for example, the agreement to protect the European Community’s financial interests as well as the two conventions on extradition of 1995 and 1996. We will continue to endeavour to ensure that these efforts bear fruit. I might add that the Council has been paying particular attention to this in the adoption of the action plan on the combating of terrorism. The action plan identifies various instruments including the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism. These conventions must be ratified within carefully defined deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Then of course we come to the questions concerning the democratic deficit within the European Union, about which the European Parliament does in fact have a number of issues to which it regularly returns. These include not the absolutely essential democratic control over activities that come under the third pillar, and in particular over Europol and Eurojust activities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Europol, the Council first wishes to emphasise that since 1 May 1999, the date on which the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, all legislative decisions to be adopted on the grounds of the Europol Convention have been presented to the European Parliament for advice. By doing so, the Council has tried to guarantee that the European Parliament would have control of Europol as far as legislative measures are concerned. With regard to the executive board’s activities, as well as Europol’s operational activities, the Council is currently studying ways and means of organising effective democratic control whilst at the same time meeting the organisation’s operational needs. Various scenarios are being examined. One of the problems that need to be dealt with is the involvement of national parliaments in the control procedures. The Presidency has made this a priority. The <span class="italic">Integrated Security in Europe</span> conference which was held in November gave rise to a debate on stricter control of the sector. The Council wishes to point out that the concern expressed by the European Parliament is at the top of the agenda. However, the careful implementation of such mechanisms is a complicated process in which the balance in the Europol system must be carefully monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the draft instrument, Eurojust, for its part, should only be assigned a cooperative and coordinating role. All decisions will be taken by the competent national authorities who will be handling the cases. However, it is possible for the European Parliament to be kept up-to-date with Eurojust’s activities provided that they are not of an operational nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The instrument establishing Eurojust therefore specifies that Parliament will receive an annual activity report which deals amongst other things with data protection. Parliament is also giving discharge for the implementation of Eurojust’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">A democratic deficit has also been observed by the European Parliament. This deficit refers to the lack of the EP’s involvement in the definition of the strategy of the European Union in all its parts, both inside and outside the Union, except for the fact that Parliament is only kept fully informed and has access to the so-called sensitive information.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say at this juncture that the Council is applying the institutional convention provisions to the letter. In this context, when the matter relates to a proposal or initiative that falls under police or judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the Council applies the provisions of Article 39 of the Treaty establishing the European Union, and when the matter is one that is covered by Title IV concerning asylum and immigration or judicial cooperation in civil matters, it applies Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Union. Experience shows us that the Council has consulted the European Parliament whenever the Commission or one of the Member States has submitted a proposal or an initiative to it. The Council was in fact present during the plenary sessions and meetings of the appropriate committee of the European Parliament, and Parliament was given ongoing information about the state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">And now to the final set of problems I would like to discuss with you, which concern the need to keep the European Parliament informed about important changes occurring in the negotiation process within the Council, both in relation to legislative proposals by the Commission and in relation to initiatives developed by the Member States. As I have already said, it was the Council’s wish to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative procedures at Community level in accordance with the provisions of the convention. It is true that the activities of the Council bodies will result in changes to the tenor of some provisions of the proposals or initiatives being submitted to them. This is in fact in keeping with the common wish to find solutions which have the support of everyone in the Union. In practice we know that if the European Parliament has not yet issued its advice on a proposal or an initiative, the Council has always been willing to provide the information requested so that the European Parliament can satisfy itself as to the direction the activities are taking. This having been said, the Council knows that the European Union’s standpoints have a specific value added which differs from those of the Member States. Since it aims in its advice to respond to a different institutional logic and give the Council the right elements within the framework of the democratic task with which it is charged, this task must obviously not depend on developments of the work done by the Council on one decision or another. What is more, the Council consults the European Parliament, if necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to conclude this part of my speech by expressing my satisfaction as President for the way in which we have been able to cooperate with the European Parliament. We sometimes had to seek advice about very profound matters in particularly difficult circumstances and at very short notice. I think that this is something that may even have been unique to this Presidency. We have never appealed to you in vain. The European Parliament has exercised flexibility when giving advice, sometimes at very short notice. This method of cooperation, coupled with our cooperation with the Commission and the Commissioner, has made it possible to take a major step towards, amongst other things, the European arrest warrant, which I believe is the most important common denominator, because this has enabled us to undertake an action in this area which is comparable to the introduction of the euro in the financial and monetary sphere. Thus the European arrest warrant has also come into being as far as cooperation in judicial matters and mutual recognition in criminal matters are concerned. This is only possible if all players demonstrate the good, positive attitude that we have encountered. I am therefore pleased that in these circumstances, the early annual report relating to judicial and home affairs matters has been given a different perspective than it has in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that – I do not agree with it but I abide by it – I shall speak particularly about the Watson report, which proposes a useful, appropriate initiative to regulate the security side of future summits of any kind. The proposal started off, it must be said, in decidedly lifeless tones as regards an objective analysis; then the tone improved along the way. This is just the opposite of what happened with a parallel initiative for the fight against terrorism, which arose out of the emotional response to 11 September and then all of a sudden became an opportunity not only to produce a European arrest warrant but more especially to cause a real witch-hunt within Italian politics. But the leader of my Group, Mr Tajani, will speak at greater length on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I return now to the Watson report, which proposes the requirement of agreeing public order measures for major summit meetings. A truly appropriate idea, I was saying: it is a pity that it should have become both an excuse for preparing a summary trial of the events at previous Summits, and especially a Trojan horse in its attempts at party political speculation in a decidedly national vein. This has all come about through instrumental amendments, in the form of direct attacks on the Italian Government and its President. Not just this, but it also reiterates a defamatory action, as has already been mentioned, against the Italian forces of law and order, which are accused of serious offences and Gestapo-like behaviour that have never been proved in the numerous inquiries that have so far been opened. This, then, amongst other things, violates the Italian State’s legitimate autonomy and sovereignty to deal with public order issues.</p>
<p class="contents">To those Members who still confuse the limits between national sovereignty and Community competences I say quite plainly – but still calmly – that it is time to stop doing the dirty washing of national politics in the European Parliament, but it is also time to put an end to the widespread sport of misusing points of order and questions in order to provoke improper debates and vitriolic attacks on persons rather than on ideas and political positions. I say this particularly to the Italian left-wing Members, the diligent supporters who regularly find room to express themselves in this House and also in the newspapers, thanks to the work of partisan reporters with little objectivity. Fortunately most of Parliament has understood this. In the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, almost all the amendments from the left were rejected. I propose that Parliament should do the same in its plenary session, and to make it quite clear I shall indicate the dangerous points: Amendment Nos 22, 25 and 29 are real chemical weapons against the truth. They should be rejected, otherwise I shall be forced to ask my coordinator to vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Santini, who has just spoken, has shown what this is all about. If we are talking about an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe, if, like the President-in-Office, we are talking about a European home affairs policy, then even such a faithful servant of this master as Mr Santini will have to come to terms with the fact that we will also discuss Italian domestic politics. Now, I am not an Italian left-winger, but a German left-winger, and I can tell you that I do not share the view expressed by Mr Verwilghen and Mr Vitorino, according to whom what happened in Rome yesterday represents progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday saw us achieve a victory in the first round, for 14 States of the European Union were consistent and determined in ensuring the failure of the attempt by the Italian Prime Minister, out of naked self-interest, to make use of his office of state to obstruct a criminal investigation that could involve him, and in ensuring that private interests were prevented from paralysing the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, this same Mr Berlusconi – a former Member of this House, who, thanks to its President, was not subject to any proceedings to lift his immunity – had this to say, and what I quote relates to what was told me by President-in-Office of the Council Verwilghen, who drew a parallel between the European arrest warrant and the euro – accurately, in fact, in terms of their dimension and political significance. What does Mr Berlusconi have to say about it? Mr Berlusconi says: "Other nations have named 2004 as the deadline for the European arrest warrant to be put into effect, although it could be later." I quote word for word.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Italian constitution is not amended, then we cannot join in, in much the same way that Great Britain is not joining in the euro. Why do I speak in terms of winning a round? I prophesy this to you: After all we have experienced in the Council, after all Italy's stonewalling in the interest of its Prime Minister, I tell you here and now that the same Prime Minister will now hold a referendum in order to prevent the European arrest warrant from being effective in Italy. This is very likely, and so I do not yet believe that we have now implemented the European arrest warrant. I do believe that this House will have to insist, with the utmost consistency, on the isolation Italy has imposed on itself over the last few weeks being maintained by the 14other European states, because anyone who has, like me or like Mrs Paciotti, crossed swords in this House with Mr Berlusconi or Mr Dell'Utri, will be painted by the Berlusconi press, as I was, as an old Stalinist – and I am not old yet, nor am I yet a Stalinist – or, like Mrs Paciotti, will be described as head of a communist conspiracy against Italy. Looking at you, Mr Tajani, I understand why the people of Rome did not elect you as their mayor. I can understand it, above all, when I hear you speak.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who, even tentatively, questions Italian policy, gets slandered in this House. Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Watson, who has presented a very balanced and good report despite the ongoing attempts at blockade and the policy of permanent obstruction which Forza Italia, part of the Group of the European People's Party – though hopefully not for much longer – has adopted.</p>

In the last two years since Tampere, the programme of cooperation on justice matters has been heavily weighted to the security side of the scales – especially since 11 September with the anti-terrorism package. All this is necessary, but it is time to rebalance the work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Laeken Summit, Heads of Government should commit themselves to a thorough review of the degree of respect in practice for the standards we have signed up to in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There needs to be a programme to ensure observance of minimum standards of due process, fair trials in criminal proceedings and approximation of rights of defendants. We should project these standards in our international agreements because there are some worrying developments. In the UK, there are proposals for executive decisions for detention without trial and an attempt to avoid any significant degree of judicial review. In the United States, President Bush has signed an order providing for trial in military courts in the absence of fundamental safeguards for fair trial provided for in international law. The EU must not agree to any extradition agreement with the US whereby people could be convicted in these military tribunals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the case of the 14 British and Dutch plane-spotters detained for nearly five weeks in Greece without trial is extremely disturbing. They have been denied bail, the evidence has been presented in secret and there has been no transparent schedule of court hearings. They may be guilty at most of a misdemeanour. It will be a disgrace if the European arrest warrant is agreed this weekend and this situation has still not been resolved. I call, in particular, on Prime Minister Blair to withhold agreement if they have not been either charged or released by Friday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our desire to create a European area of safety and justice is a common one. Over the past few weeks and even over the past few days, we have taken some important steps, and I would like to personally congratulate you on the efforts you have made in this regard and on the results you have achieved, because efforts are not always enough; we also have to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to point out – and I share your opinion, but I know that there are others who do not – that security cannot be used as an excuse for threatening fundamental rights. I am indeed a little concerned when I see how quick some people are to use the word ‘terrorism’ and to apply it to all kinds of things they do not like, both in international and national politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has rightly been pressing for a strict definition, and has been knocking the eagerness to label all dissidents as terrorists on the head. I am pleased to hear you say that the Council is following Parliament on this. I would also like to see this confirmed in all texts, because people who want to change the constitution in their country are not necessarily terrorists, and people demonstrating against globalisation and injustice in the world are also not necessarily terrorists. Absolutely not, in most cases. We believe that anyone who equates this with terrorism is violating fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to return to the European arrest warrant, including the guarantees being demanded by the European Parliament.

In the name of the war against terrorism, they are waging war against democratic freedoms and the social acquis.

This is because better coordination between Member States overcomes the problem described to a large extent. It is incomprehensible that the report only refers to the Charter, a political statement, whilst the European Convention on Human Rights, the perfect convention for the protection of our citizens’ rights, is not mentioned in it. Since the US terrorist attacks of 11 September, the EU’s attitude towards the US has been highly critical as well as supportive. The object of our criticism is the new anti-terrorism legislation. Some discretion in this regard would not be out of place. Please do not get me wrong; I am no advocate of trials by military tribunals without the possibility of appeal, and I believe that the USA must reconsider this, but I do wonder how we would have reacted if these attacks had taken place in the EU. Refusing point blank to extradite terrorists to the USA is sending out the wrong signal.

We base our activity on a system of values that have been set out and listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on an approach under which monitoring by the states of the level of citizens’ freedoms alternates with recourse to the Court of Justice, both the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Strasbourg Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, Europe is not an oasis and the world is interactive: if I may put it this way, the world around us does not stand still, which justifies taking external action in the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">First there are the candidate countries. We cannot allow any differentiation in respect of these countries. Naturally, we will have to require the same level and the same perception of citizens’ freedoms. Then there are the countries close to us, the countries that will become close to us by what I might call capillary action. I am thinking of countries such as Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, in respect of which we will have to decide how to act. Lastly there are the partner countries, countries that are the source of immigrants and asylum seekers and with which we must maintain a constant dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need for external action. We have two types of external action. The first type is rather messianic, involving the export and globalisation of law and order and the constitutional state as we understand it. Then we have protective action vis-à-vis this external world, because, of course, there are crimes and scourges that know no frontiers, a problem to which we will have to find the appropriate answers, without of course ever abandoning the values we have set out and proclaimed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would like to defend the European Parliament, which has to play its full role, because traditionally parliaments are meant to be the custodians of citizens’ freedoms and we have to play this role. Obviously this means more than involving our Parliament in the strategy and implementation of external actions in the field of justice and home affairs. It is also a question of our resources. In this regard, in my few remaining seconds of speaking time and under the authority of Mr Watson, the chairman of our Committee on Citizens’ Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would plead for this committee to be given additional resources in terms of staffing.</p>
<p class="contents">After many struggles, including a decision this Chamber adopted unanimously, we have managed to acquire one extra member of staff for the committee, although this person is in fact employed by DG IV; meanwhile the Committee on Foreign Affairs has nine members of staff assigned to human rights. I find it irresponsible that if a Parliament wants to give its Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms the resources to do its job, it does not to give it the staff needed to assist the colleagues who are responsible for the committee’s reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was dragged away from the gates of Laeken. How pleased should we be now? The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice goes to the very core of the relationship between governments and citizens. The exercising of legitimate pressure versus the upholding of the citizen’s essential fundamental rights. In the past, revolutions were fought and extensive constitutional debates were held in Europe over this tense relationship. However, legislation on this matter is now being introduced in the third pillar of the European Union by means of framework resolutions engineered by the Council using secret diplomacy, monitored by national parliaments and the European Parliament. In this respect, we are back in the 19th Century.</p>
<p class="contents">Our desire to reform the European decision-making process and to close the so-called democratic loophole are well-known. However, it will require a Treaty change and sufficient political will to do this, but we cannot wait that long. The procedure concerning the European arrest warrant demonstrates that a critical boundary has been crossed. Our own credibility as representatives of the people is at stake, so democratic legitimacy must also be increased in the current Treaty in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that was recently adopted in the Dutch Upper Chamber is one way of doing this. It asks for the introduction of a phase of active openness in the Council’s decision-making process. According to this proposal, a final decision on draft framework resolutions is only taken after a period of at least six weeks, during which time citizens and organisations in the Member States are given the opportunity to form their opinions. The role of national parliaments and the European Parliament should also gain in significance in this way. This would at the very least prevent us from voting on out-of-date documents as we did in November, or only nodding our assent retrospectively, which we may do this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that we lay down such a modest reform of the decision-making process in a new interinstitutional agreement, and if anyone thinks that this is asking too much, they should say so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sweden, for example, has frozen all the assets of a number of Swedish citizens of Somali origin on the basis solely of a US list. They have no opportunity to defend themselves or to lodge an appeal. Two days ago, a Swede was expelled from Belgium for having put up posters for one of the legal demonstrations to be held in conjunction with the Laeken Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, one may well ask how far we can go before destroying both the rule of law and freedom of movement within the EU. Are all these precipitous measures really only targeting terrorism or is it in actual fact the case that, despite all promises to the contrary, this is in practice turning into a campaign on the part of the authorities and the establishment against both immigrants from Muslim countries and normal legal protest movements against the neo-liberal class-based society? It would be excellent if the Commission and the Council could show that this is not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The murder victim Carlo Giugliani probably did not get such a letter, any more than did the people who were beaten up and shot at in the Diaz School or on the streets of Gothenburg.

It is certainly a positive step, but it is no more than the beginning of a long process of trying to set up, at last, a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice. The new European Constitution should lead to harmonisation of criminal law and procedure in our Union. The Member States should work towards a situation in which crimes and penalties do not differ from one place to another. We must all, in short, commit ourselves to establishing fair trials, that is, to having a third judge, allowing evidence to take shape in the course of the trial and to having the prosecuting magistrates separate from the judges.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not blackmail, Mr Watson; it is not an Italian caprice, as has been suggested in this House; it is the will of Parliament, which, in 1997, voted for the Roth report, which invited the Member States to carry out a genuine reform of justice in favour of a fair trial. That is why so many criticisms levelled by the left against the Italian Government in this House are unfounded and the result of propaganda by a handful of fundamentalist magistrates. Moreover, the foreign press in Italy has recognised this; in this respect, I quote the words of a respected journalist in the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,</span> Hans Jürgen Fischer, who said, ‘All these charges against the Berlusconi Government seemed quite out of proportion to me.’ It is therefore our duty to reject all the attacks made on the Italian Government by left-wing MEPs who do not understand the situation in Italy and who, beginning with the leader of the Socialist Group, Mr Barón Crespo, have made absolutely unfounded attacks on the Italian Government and on Italy. I repeat, they are attacks that we firmly reject because it is all just propaganda. In short, a lot of fuss has been made about nothing and Parliament has not achieved any results. The results were actually achieved thanks to the action of the Italian Government, which concluded the agreement with Mr Verhofstadt yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The events that have taken place over these last two years, such as the tragic deaths of Moroccan and sub-Saharan citizens in the Straits of Gibraltar and off the Andalusian coast, the death of immigrants in Dover or the recent incidents in Ireland, the repugnant traffic in, and corruption of, minors, and prostitution, combined with the horrific murders committed by ETA and the tragedy of 11 September, have caused an upheaval in the debate and have accelerated the need for the speedy implementation of measures to cope with such a dangerous and worrying situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and Parliament in this field has its good and bad points. The good points include the fight against terrorism, where the important role which our President, Nicole Fontaine, has played in this area, as well as Commissioner Vitorino, deserve a special mention; the European arrest warrant and the definition of terrorism are the result of a difficult battle against terrorism that started in this House before 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress what a good thing it has been to separate the debates on economic migration and asylum, which has helped us to clarify ideas, debates, and even approaches. However, in my opinion, there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">There are too many bad points and the most worrying of these in my opinion is the disorder caused by the hastiness and lack of agreement in the Council in areas such as the family reunification of immigrants, minimum standards on the asylum process, conditions for the reception of asylum seekers – to give but a few examples – where our work is sometimes ineffective due to the fact we have to chop and change what is carried out by the Council, which shows that the method with which we have to work is not ideal by any means and needs to be amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Berlusconi Government manages, even for a short time, to block the decision on the European arrest warrant, can you imagine what will happen when the Union of the 15 becomes a Union of 30 if we continue to insist on an intergovernmental rather than a Community method for taking decisions? A propos, my congratulations to the Belgian Presidency on the battle which it won in Rome yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is clearly unwilling to make any fundamental reforms on the basis the commitments made in Tampere, despite the assiduous efforts of Commissioner Vitorino and the political will demonstrated by the European Parliament. The only sector in which the Council has evinced any particular interest or enthusiasm is in the fight against terrorism, under pressure from and at the suggestion of the United States which, I am afraid, is trying to export and impose its system of justice on Europe, a system which clashes with European customs and values. How can we extradite European citizens to the USA when the United States cannot guarantee that it will not impose the death penalty? I am afraid, Commissioner, that the alliance with the USA is becoming more and more dangerous for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that strict rules are being promoted within an already strict framework is understandably causing concern among citizens, who fear that the fundamental liberties and human rights which they have fought long and sacrificed much for will be restricted. The end clearly does not justify the means. For the rest, half way through the five-year period set by the Amsterdam summit for creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, we are seriously behind schedule, for example in formulating a common immigration and asylum policy. Finally, I wonder, what has happened to European sensitivity and our humanitarian values, when we are incapable of resolving the drama of refugees and immigrants despite witnessing daily tragedies such as the recent suffocation of eight immigrants in southern Ireland? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to point out that major progress has been made but that, on the other hand, there are still many obstacles to be overcome. The Union is proud, and rightly so, of its constant defence of respect for human rights in the world and within the Community. The recently proclaimed Charter of Fundamental Rights reinforced our commitment in this regard and the area of freedom, security and justice only makes sense if all three of these elements are taken together and if no one of them prejudices any other.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic events of September 11 and the intensified attention to safety measures cannot detract from this fundamental approach. Since it is necessary to meet citizens’ expectations in terms of fighting terrorism, special care must be taken not to fall into excesses or exaggeration, that is to say, ‘everything for security’. The Member States’ commitment to building an area of freedom, security and justice was once again reaffirmed at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council. It is vital that within this area citizens may enjoy the right to express themselves, demonstrate and meet freely and peacefully, provided that they do so in a way which does not constitute a threat, either to their own safety or to the safety of other citizens and property.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too, we must not exaggerate. Any individual or group of people wishing to take part in legitimate demonstrations should not be blocked at the borders, that is, they cannot be denied the right to cross frontiers, i.e. they cannot be denied freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right granted to all citizens of the Union by the Treaty. Because security is merely an instrument to ensure freedom. Security loses its meaning when it prejudices freedom. Security without freedom is tyranny. In this festive season, my best wishes to Commissioner António Vitorino for the continuation of his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears to me that Parliament is going to make a worthwhile contribution today in confronting a violent situation in the streets of Europe which is a worry to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the advances made in the area of freedom, security and justice, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission on what they were able to achieve yesterday, especially with regard to the European arrest warrant, and I would also like to congratulate the Council for a very particular reason, for the sincerity of the report from the Belgian Presidency with regard to the progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the Council does in its report, I would like to express my concern at the lack of progress made in the area of common asylum policy, and even more so in the area of common immigration policy. Not only is there no European policy but, as we have seen recently, there are quite a few governments who are developing their own new national policies, and, what is inexcusable in some cases, justifying these decisions citing Europe as the underlying cause. I hope that in Laeken we can make progress, however small, and make a new commitment in accordance with what the Commission said in its two communications on asylum and on immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think that the agreement reached on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, the so-called European arrest warrant, is very important. This seems to me to be a giant step forward, of course, in the fight against terrorism, but also in the fight against money laundering, in the fight against corruption, in the fight against human trafficking, including of women for sexual exploitation, and in the fight against organised crime. To me, this seems important, but it also seems that we should take some time to think and it is this that, thirdly, I would like to ask the Council: I think that in Laeken you should take into account not only the advances made in the agenda but also how these have been achieved and which problems must be dealt with. It seems to me that the unanimity and the lack of real power of this Parliament do not help.</p>
<p class="contents">We are living in a world of paradoxes. A few days ago, in a manner of speaking, we said that Bin Laden had provided the impetus for implementing methods for fighting terrorism that the Commission had been planning and that Parliament had requested some time ago. Paradoxically, it was also the spectacle made by Mr Berlusconi’s government that brought the debate on the European arrest warrant onto the front page of the papers. I would sincerely have preferred for this debate to have taken place in Parliament, for there to have been a public debate and for you to have accepted it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I am pleased that you appreciate the institutional loyalty of this Parliament.

I only have four objections: one about the past, one about yesterday, in a manner of speaking, one about tomorrow, although I really mean the day after tomorrow, and one about the future. Let me start with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the concept of creating a European area of freedom, security and justice first saw the light of day about 25 years ago. I think that we have taken a number of essential steps in the right direction without crowing about it, but also without achieving the results we want to achieve. We did not – and I would like to say this here in the European Parliament – have to organise a witch-hunt or use Gestapo-style practices. On the contrary, anyone who has read the Watson report and the advice from the European Parliament and who knows the position of the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and that of the Commission, knows that we do not use such methods.</p>
<p class="contents">However, yesterday – and I am now thinking back to Tampere 1999 when we took the decision to put a series of recommendations to the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs – I discovered that since then we have in fact been correctly following the three paths that were delineated there to create this area, namely those of harmonisation, mutual cooperation and the creation of players.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, and by that I mean the day after tomorrow, I hope that at the Laeken Summit we will give new impetus to the Amsterdam resolutions and the Tampere recommendations that have not yet been implemented. I am saying this here with all the more conviction because I believe that there are two areas to which attention absolutely must be paid: the fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against the sexual and economic exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally to the future. I have often heard people say that we would have to choose between freedom and security, but I do not think that is necessary. Justice and security are two instruments that are necessary in order to guarantee freedoms. A pertinent comment that I often hear, and one that we cannot ignore, is that we will have to ask ourselves about institutional decision-making and more specifically whether unanimity should be maintained in the third pillar. These are a number of objections that I wanted to put to the European Parliament at the end of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you very briefly, in reply to a question put during the debate, that the American President wrote a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister and to the President of the European Commission pointing to a number of areas in which the United States of America considered that there was a need to deepen cooperative relations with the European Union in the fight against terrorism. Prime Minister Verhofstadt and President Prodi replied to that letter on 28 November. That is the first point I want to clarify. There is no private or special correspondence between the President of the European Commission and the American President. There was an exchange of letters between the American President and the European Union, represented by both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substantive questions, let me tell you quite frankly that the truth is that we had already taken decisions on most of the aspects referred to by President Bush, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of 20 September; these decisions were in fact supported by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Brussels on 21 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, I believe that there are some difficult areas in the context of cooperation with the United States; we must not conceal that fact. Incidentally I have always said this and I said it again to Mr Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting last week. Of course we supported and still support the agreement signed between Europol and the American police agencies on cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The agreement does not cover possible exchanges of personal data because we realise that this is a sensitive area in which the Europeans and Americans apply different standards. So this area will have to be approached separately as a specific task, which we will indeed do as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is one rather important area of cooperation, namely judicial assistance; as soon as Eurojust is established definitively, we will have an important tool in our hands for mutual judicial assistance with third countries. Here again, however, we will have to clarify the rules on exchanges of personal data within the framework of mutual judicial assistance involving third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the subject of extradition, I agree with what Mr Watson said about the internal imbalance of the US Patriot Act as regards the legal status of US citizens vis-à-vis other citizens, including Europeans. That is no doubt an area we will have to look at together with our American friends. I also had occasion to say that Europe has not taken any exceptional measures to combat terrorism. We have not derogated from the Charter of Fundamental Rights; we have not introduced any exceptional measures to combat terrorism, so I do not think it is fair to criticise Europe for being in the process of adopting measures it is not in fact adopting. All the measures that have been taken to combat terrorism and that are now in force are measures based on the existing legislative framework or are measures, such as the European arrest warrant or the framework decision on terrorism, which were planned well before 11 September. Furthermore, in the case of the European arrest warrant, there is no doubt at all: we were asked to introduce it by the Heads of State and Government in October 1999 to replace extradition. All those who keep on trying to interpret these measures as emergency measures are wrong: no, Europe did not react to the terrorist threat by departing from its fundamental principles or taking emergency measures. It reacted by taking measures that were no doubt introduced in an exceptional climate, but that are measures we had been asked to take and that had been planned a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, on the question of extradition, let me repeat to the European Parliament that the Commission has always said that we have never changed our position on the death penalty and that we have said quite plainly that our position in this dialogue did not allow for any possibility of extradition to Member States that apply the death penalty. Having said that, I will certainly read the resolution the European Parliament is about to adopt very closely and reflect carefully on the implications of your recommendation. I do not agree with Mr Di Lello, for, in my view, if there are guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied that is sufficient to guarantee respect for the fundamental values. This needs to be said very plainly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I want to tell you that I hope the Laeken European Council will enable us to give fresh impetus to the major task of establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, in the field of asylum and immigration as in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation, by accepting the gradual and pragmatic approach we are taking. I have no illusions, however. When it comes to turning Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, we are looking at the very heart of European political cooperation. We know, from our 50 years of experience, that this political integration is never easy. That said, we shall persevere because I believe that our citizens expect us to find a political response to the needs of European integration. That is why I am so excited to be taking part, at your side, in this project for an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>

This morning, during the debate on the Watson report – a particularly heated debate – in the course of the speech by Mr Schulz, who had attacked the Italian Prime Minister, the President of Parliament and certain Italian Members, there was an interruption from the public, who loudly applauded what Mr Schulz said. I appealed to the acting President – I did not argue with Mr Schulz, naturally – and asked him to make the members of the public present in the House remain silent. I recall that Rule 116 says: ‘Members of the public admitted to the galleries shall remain seated and keep silent. Any person expressing approval or disapproval shall immediately be ejected by the ushers.’ When I turned to President Schmid I was given the following answer: ‘You are right, but I cannot tie the hands of those present in the House.’ I believe the acting President contravened the Rules of Procedure. I believe the Rules of Procedure should be obeyed to the letter: this applies to the left, the centre and the right; it applies to everybody, because it is the Rules of Procedure that dictate civilised coexistence in this House. This is Parliament, not the Strasbourg stadium!</p>
