<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Accession negotiations with Croatia are progressing well, and are nearing their final stage. The eighth meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference with Croatia on 2 October dealt in total with eleven chapters and represented a crucial step in Croatia’s accession process. Six chapters were opened and five provisionally closed, which means that, since the start of the negotiations, a total of twenty eight chapters have been opened, of which twelve have been provisionally closed. The signing of an agreement on arbitration by Slovenia and Croatia in Stockholm on November 4th will enable the parties to resolve the outstanding border issue which has been hampering formal progress in the negotiations during 2009. The agreement is a major achievement, and demonstrates a commitment to the principles and values of European cooperation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Presidency wishes to underline that accession negotiations are a complex process, both from a political and technical viewpoint. It is not therefore appropriate to give any timeframe for the conclusion of this process. Progress in the negotiations is mainly guided by the efforts made by Croatia in preparing for accession, in addressing opening and closing benchmarks, as well as in meeting the requirements of the Negotiating Framework and in fulfilling its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association agreement. The Swedish Presidency is fully committed to continue to take forward this process and intends, if the conditions are met, to convene at least one more meeting of the conference before the end of its term in order to open and provisionally close as many chapters as possible.</p>
<p>As regards the possible beginning of accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Presidency notes the recommendation of the Commission in this year’s Enlargement Strategy to start accession negotiations. The Council has not yet taken a view on this issue. It would not be appropriate for the Presidency to prejudge the position of the Council on the matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0365"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The conclusions of the Council (ECOFIN) of 20 October include a commitment to design a comprehensive and coordinated fiscal exit strategy. The exit strategy will be designed so as to strike a balance between stabilisation and sustainability concerns, take into account the interactions between the different policy instruments, as well as the discussions at the global level. The Council will develop details of the exit strategy in further meetings. An important step in this respect will be the recommendations to countries in Excessive Deficit Procedure, which will be adopted by the Council on 2 December.</p>
<p>The Council has agreed in its Conclusions that if the Commission forecasts in November 2009 and the first half of 2010 confirm that the economic recovery is on the way to become self-sustaining, the appropriate starting point for withdrawal of measures would be the year 2011. However, all Member States are not affected in the same way, therefore, differentiation among them must be applied when the start of fiscal consolidation is determined on. The differentiation will be made based on a number of objective criteria taking into account aspects influencing future revenues, expenditures and growth of individual Member States.</p>
<p>Consequently, some Member States may wish to start with the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus measures before 2011.</p>
<p>The European Council of 29-30 October stressed indeed that there is no room for complacency, although there are signs of improvement in the world economy.</p>
<p>On 10 November, the Council held another exchange of views on exit strategy as regards measures taken by Member States to support the financial sector, focusing on methods and timing for the phasing out of bank guarantee schemes, which were put in place during the financial crisis.</p>
<p>It asked the Economic and Financial Committee to continue work on principles and on a tentative timeframe for the coordinated withdrawal of the support measures, whilst taking account of the situation in individual Member States, and to report back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Council also underlined the need to return to sustainable fiscal positions, starting with the implementation of the agreed principles for the exit strategy endorsed in October 2009, and subsequently moving towards the Medium Term Budgetary Objectives.</p>
<p>The reduction in debt ratios will have to come from a combination of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to support potential growth.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0367"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The EU remains confident that in Copenhagen a global and comprehensive agreement can be reached in order for the global temperature increase to be kept below 2° C above the pre-industrial level. The science and the economics of climate change are clear: Every year of delay in action means that it will become more difficult and costly to reach our global goal. Momentum has been building up during the last years and awareness about the urgency of the matter is higher than ever.</p>
<p>The determination of the EU to play a leading role and to contribute to reaching a legally binding agreement for the period starting 1 January 2013 was confirmed by the European Council on 29-30 November 2009. The European Council invited the Presidency to maintain a strong negotiation position throughout the process and agreed that it would review the situation at its meeting in December.</p>
<p>Ensuring that an ambitious agreement is reached in Copenhagen will require convergence on the following essential building blocks:</p>
<p>deep and ambitious emission reduction commitments by developed countries by 2020, including a shared vision until 2050;</p>
<p>measurable, reportable and verifiable actions by developing countries leading to a limitation in their emission growth and a peaking of emissions as soon as possible;</p>
<p>a framework for adapting to climate change as well as for technology and capacity building support;</p>
<p>financing for developing countries in the framework of a fair and equitable governance system.</p>
<p>We are now fast approaching the start of the Copenhagen conference and some positive and encouraging signs from both developed and developing countries can be heard. Norway and Japan have increased their emission reduction pledges to respectively -40 and -25% by 2020 compared to 1990. China and India are discussing constructively.</p>
<p>Still, a lot of work lies ahead of us. And most importantly, we need to maintain the pressure on two of the most important players in the negotiations, the US and China. The summit with the US was held on 3 November; the EU-China Summit is scheduled for 30 November 2009.</p>
<p>All in all, it will be an uphill struggle but a clear and ambitious political agreement in Copenhagen is still within reach. Even if we may not hammer out the last dot’s of a legally binding instrument, I do believe a political binding agreement with specific commitment to mitigation and finance provides a strong basis for immediate action in the years to come. The stronger our political agreement in Copenhagen, the faster the progress towards a new legally binding, global climate regime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0402"></a>

<p>(EN) As I have indicated yesterday during the debate on this issue, the EU remains confident that a successful outcome in Copenhagen can be achieved so as to keep the global temperature increase below 2° C above the pre-industrial level. The EU is determined to play a leading role in that process as well as to contribute to ultimately reaching a legally binding agreement for the period starting on 1 January 2013.</p>
<p>In this context, ensuring that an ambitious agreement is reached in Copenhagen will require convergence on the following essential building blocks:</p>
<p>deep and ambitious emission reduction commitments by developed countries by 2020, including a shared vision until 2050. Some countries, such as Japan and Norway, have upped their pledges. But it is clear that what is currently on the table does not add up to what science considers to be needed to keep the 2° C objective within reach. In this context, the EU will reiterate its demands to other developed countries to take on ambitious and comparable targets.</p>
<p>measurable, reportable and verifiable actions by developing countries leading to a limitation in their emission growth and a peaking of emissions as soon as possible. In this context, the EU will ask developing countries which have not yet done so to put forward their low-carbon growth plans and thereby quantify to what extent those measures would lead to a limitation in their emissions. As you know, Indonesia, Brazil and South Korea have already made significant contributions.</p>
<p>a framework for adapting to climate change as well as for technology and capacity building;</p>
<p>financing in the framework of a fair and equitable governance system for mitigation, adaptation, capacity-building and technology in developing countries. In this context, it will be important to agree already on the amount of fast-start financing that will be needed for developing countries in order to create the necessary conditions and framework to lay the foundations for the implementation of a post-2012 agreement.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, the Presidency hopes - with your active support - to reach agreement on all the elements which I have just outlined.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0369"></a>

<p>The Council actively participates in the regular human rights dialogue with the State of Israel through the Informal Working Group on Human Rights, most recently, on 3 September 2009. The dialogue is marked by open atmosphere and deals with issues that include minorities, children’s rights, administrative detention and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, relations between the EU and Israel are guided by the Action Plan. In this Action Plan, both the EU and Israel have committed themselves to promote human rights.</p>
<p>With regard to the Middle East Peace process, the Council emphasised in its conclusions of 15 June 2009 that respect for international humanitarian law must be ensured by all parties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0370"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council carefully examines all issues regarding reporting of data related to the Stability and Growth Pact, as these data represent the foundation for correct implementation of the Pact. In this sense, decisions on euro adoption are taken after very careful examination of all relevant criteria, in line with the provisions of the Treaty. The Council has addressed the issue of revision of the Greek data for the period from 1997-2003 in its Conclusions of 21 October 2004 and welcomed the Commission’s initiative for a detailed report on Greece’s deficit and debt data back to 1997 with a view to drawing the necessary conclusions so that revisions of such magnitude do not happen again.</p>
<p>The Council is very much aware of the ongoing issue of data quality in Greece and regrets the renewed problems in the Greek notifications for the current and previous years. It will address the issue in one of its forthcoming meetings, on the basis of a comprehensive assessment by the Commission. On 10 November, the Council invited the Commission to produce a report by the end of 2009 and to propose the appropriate measures to be taken in this situation. It also welcomed the commitment made by the Greek Government to address the issue swiftly.</p>
<p>Within the aim of preventing a recurrence of significant data revisions, the Council amended Regulation 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community in December 2005. The revision reinforces the responsibility of the Member States to provide accurate data in a timely manner and enables the European Commission to better monitor the quality of data reported by the Member States. If necessary, the Commission can report to the European Parliament and the Council on its findings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0378"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns about any use of the media to incite hatred or violence.</p>
<p>As the Presidency has already said in precedent answers to the European Parliament on similar questions, the broadcasting of television programmes containing incitement to racial and religious hatred is incompatible with the values that are the basis of our democracies, and is totally intolerable.</p>
<p>As you know, the Council, together with the European Parliament as colegislator, adopted on 18 December 2007 the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. This directive updates the legal framework for television broadcasting and audiovisual media services in the EU. Article 3b of this directive prohibits broadcasts inciting hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>The scope of this directive and its consequent jurisdiction can include programmes broadcast by organisations established outside the EU, such as Al-Aqsa, but only if they use satellite facilities ‘appertaining to a Member State’. It is for the Member State concerned to take responsibility for the correct implementation of the directive under the supervision of the Commission. Therefore, under the aforementioned directive, it is up to the national authorities concerned to carefully consider the issue raised by the honourable Member. The Council understands that the regulatory authority of France issued a warning (‘mise en demeure’) in December 2008 regarding the broadcasting of Al-Aqsa on Eutelsat, and is now considering further steps.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Those arrested were handed over to Kenya in accordance with Article 12 of the Council Joint Action on a European Union military operation to contribute to the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast.</p>
<p>This Joint Action provides that persons having committed acts of piracy shall be transferred to the competent authorities of the flag Member State or of the third State participating in the operation, of the vessel which took them captive, or to a Member State or any third State which wishes to exercise its jurisdiction over the aforementioned persons.</p>
<p>Since, in these cases, neither those States participating in the operation and having captured pirates, nor other EU Member States, were either able or willing to exercise their jurisdiction over the suspected pirates, they were transferred to the Republic of Kenya.</p>
<p>According to the Council Joint Action, no persons may be transferred to a third State unless the conditions for the transfer have been agreed with that third State in a manner consistent with relevant international law. At that time, Kenya was the only country with which the European Union has concluded an agreement on the conditions of transfer of persons suspected of acts of piracy.</p>
<p>The legal basis for arrest is Article 105 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This provided that on the high seas, or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State, every State may seize a pirate ship or aircraft and arrest the persons and seize the property on board.</p>
<p>The EU Member States, which are all party to UNCLOS, authorised, pursuant to the Council Joint Action already mentioned, the EU Naval Force to implement powers granted under Article 105 of UNCLOS. By virtue of UN Security Council Resolution 1816 and subsequent resolutions, such powers can be exercised with regard to armed robbers within the territorial waters of Somalia.</p>
<p>Regarding the question as to whether all the ships involved in Operation Atalanta are authorised to make arrests, I can confirm that the Joint Action is applicable to all EU Member States participating in the operation.</p>
<p>The modalities of arrest are set out in planning documents agreed by the Council and are implemented by all ships participating in the operation, unless their national rules prevent them from doing so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0384"></a>

<p>The economic downturn has affected different EU countries in different ways. Some will get over the crisis quickly and easily, while others will have to pay a higher price. What is most painful is that this price will have to be paid by people on the lowest incomes. This may further exacerbate poverty and social exclusion. Lithuania is one of the countries where unemployment is rising sharply, while pensions, social benefits and social programmes are shrinking. Governments are urging everyone to tighten their belts and to resolve problems in a spirit of solidarity. Member States’ inherent capacities are limited, however. The principle of solidarity should apply in the European Union as well. I have no doubt that ways can be found of supporting those Member States most affected by the crisis. One example I would mention is the European Social Fund (ESF). If national cofinancing of ESF projects were temporarily suspended, the resources made available could be used to tackle unemployment and social problems.</p>
<p>What is the Council’s view on the possibility of temporarily suspending national cofinancing of ESF projects? What other measures does the Council propose to lessen social decline in the Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns regarding the severity of the current financial and economic crisis and its impact on vulnerable groups of people in the EU.</p>
<p>As the Members of the Parliament well know, the Commission submitted to the Council in July a proposal to amend the General Regulation concerning the Structural Funds. Among other things, the Commission proposed a temporary option for Member States to request during 2009 and 2010 interim payments by the Commission without the need to provide national cofinancing for programmes which are eligible under the European Social Fund.</p>
<p>It has, however, become clear that this proposal has not enough support among the Member States. This is, in particular, because several Member States consider that national cofinancing is one of the fundamental principles of the EU’s structural policy, and that one should not deviate from it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Council feels strongly that additional measures are needed to alleviate the impacts of the economic crisis in those Member States that are most affected by it. Therefore, the Council is currently examining alternative ways to use structural funds for this purpose - ways which would be much better targeted to those Member States that are most in need of them. Any solutions adopted by the Council will, of course, be sent to the Parliament for its assent.</p>
<p>Another measure which aims at alleviating the impact of the crisis is the amended Regulation establishing the European Globalisation Fund. This Regulation was revised in 2009, as a part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, to enable the Fund to react more effectively in support of workers made redundant as a result of globalisation, to enlarge its scope temporarily to cover redundancies caused by the impact of the global financial and economic crisis, and to bring the operation of the Fund more closely into line with its solidarity objective.</p>
<p>Further, a new microfinance facility is currently being discussed in the Council and the European Parliament. This instrument, which would be managed jointly with international financial institutions, aims at increasing access to micro-credits for vulnerable groups of people to enable them to launch their own new businesses, as well as for micro-enterprises, and thus at reducing unemployment and poverty resulting from the current financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>For the operation of the facility, the existing structures of the ESF as well as the supporting measures of other Community initiatives, such as JEREMIE and JASMINE, could be used. It is expected that the original amount of EUR 100 million to be reallocated from the Progress Programme, as proposed by the Commission, could leverage more than EUR 500 million and thus contribute to the recovery of the economies of the individual Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0389"></a>

<p>The European Union is the Council of Europe’s most important institutional partner at both political and technical levels. Their common goals are to strengthen the European common legal space, and to build a coherent system of fundamental rights’ protection, focusing on benchmarks for human rights, the rule of law and democracy throughout the whole of Europe. The European Court of Human Rights is one of the institutions established to implement those common goals, especially dedicated to protecting the human rights of citizens from all Council of Europe Member States.</p>
<p>There are, unfortunately, shortcomings in the work of the Court. There are about 100 000 cases pending at the Court, 60 000 of which come from Romania, Ukraine, Turkey and Russia (about 20 000 from Russia alone). On top of that, there is an influx of 2 000 pending cases each month, and the period for solving cases at the Court has reached 7 years. This means that applicants who have experienced human rights violations in their countries are forced to wait almost 10 years for justice. The slow procedures at the Court create a situation which breaches the rights of applicants to a timely and fair hearing. Some experts view this situation as critical. If no solution is found in the very near future, the Court may lose credibility.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council is well aware of the difficulties highlighted by the honourable Member and is particularly concerned at the consequences of this situation, caused notably by the non-ratification by Russia of Protocol 14 to the European Convention of Human Rights, on the efficiency of the European Court of Human Rights. Protocol 14, which provides for simplification of the Court’s procedures and is intended to help it tackle the backlog of cases, can only enter into force when ratified by all Council of Europe members.</p>
<p>The European Union regularly addresses the issue of ratification of Protocol 14 at all levels in its political dialogue with Russia. Russia’s response regarding the prospects of ratification by the Russian Parliament of the said Protocol has recently been more positive. According to some signals, ratification could be possible by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The EU Member States continue to make every effort to assist the Court, including through the adoption, as an interim measure, of a Protocol No 14 bis and of an agreement on provisional application of certain provisions of Protocol No 14. Protocol No 14 bis applies to those Member States of the Council of Europe who have ratified it and the agreement to those Member States who have declared their willingness to be bound by it. Protocol No 14 bis and the agreement on provisional application introduces the same two procedural measures related to the number of judges that examine applications and decide on their admissibility and merits. These measures were already contained in Protocol No 14 and aim at increasing the Court’s case processing capacity. They should indeed help the Court to face the ever-accelerating influx of new applications and the constantly growing backlog of cases.</p>
<p>However, it is widely recognised among Member States and others that more needs to be done in this regard. To this end, the EU welcomes the high level conference on the future of the Court that will be held in Interlaken in February next year during the Swiss chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The EU takes an active part in the preparations for the conference and see this as a priority for the Council of Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0392"></a>

Rights of the child must be systematically and strategically taken into account and the Commission Communication ‘Towards an EU Strategy on the rights of the child’ (2006) reflects important considerations in this regard. Children in particularly vulnerable situations should receive special attention, notably unaccompanied minors in the context of immigration policy, children that are victims of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Climate change has become a global challenge. Its consequences can already be seen today and immediate action is required. At the October European Council meeting, the Heads of State or Government set out the EU’s position with regard to the forthcoming Copenhagen conference. The European Council reiterated its determination to play a leading role and contribute to reaching a global, ambitious and comprehensive agreement. Although the EU is ready to take its fair share of responsibility at Copenhagen, action by the EU alone will not be enough and a deal on financing will be a central part of the agreement in Copenhagen. We have also recognised the need to develop arrangements to make the best use of new and sustainable investment and financial flows from various sources, including innovative forms of financing. More generally, the October European Council stated that ‘innovative financing can play a role in ensuring predictable flows of financing for sustainable development, especially towards the poorest and most vulnerable countries’.</p>
<p>The entire international community is now aware that the impact of climate change risks reversing progress towards achieving the MDGs. That is why climate change is both a development and an environment issue. While climate change is included in MDG 7, it is clear that it is interlinked with other development issues, notably poverty and hunger. Hence, tackling the negative impact of climate change would also have the benefits in terms of improving food security and reducing poverty as stated in MDG 1.</p>
<p>The October European Council clearly stated that ‘in parallel with deliveries of climate financing, all international parties should commit that such financing would not undermine or jeopardise the fight against poverty and continued progress towards the Millennium Development Goals’.</p>
<p>In particular, activities undertaken in response to climate change need to be country-driven and should clearly be based on the needs, views and priorities of partner countries. National sustainable development strategies, poverty reduction strategies and related climate change policies and instruments should be taken into account (where they exist).</p>
<p>Developing countries should establish and implement their national climate change strategies and ensure that these strategies are fully integrated into policies, plans and programmes in all relevant sectors (e.g. agriculture and rural development, water resources management, etc.). Of course, from the donors’ point of view, these should be in line with the principles of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) as well as with those of aid effectiveness.</p>
<p>All countries therefore need to commit themselves to improve the link between climate change and development planning and maximise synergies between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0400"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The honourable Member has posed a most timely question concerning a coherent strategy in order to create a more competitive and attractive environment for job creation within the EU in a globalised economy.</p>
<p>The Council wishes to reiterate its view that the open global economy offers opportunities for stimulating growth and competitiveness also in Europe<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In this context, the Council wishes, in particular, to recall its commitment to conduct the EU’s internal and external policies in a consistent way, thus contributing to maximising the benefits and minimising the costs of globalisation<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Article 125 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that Member States and the Community shall work towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment and particularly, for promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce and labour markets responsive to economic change. To respond to this requirement of the Treaty, the Union has developed since 1997 the European Employment Strategy which, over the years, has been integrated more and more deeply with the other strategies of the Union and which, in 2000, became part of the Lisbon Strategy. An important part of the European Employment Strategy are the so called Integrated Guidelines that the Council draws up pursuant to Article 128(2) TEC and that the Member States have to take into account in their employment policies.</p>
<p>The current Integrated Guidelines run until 2010, covering macro-economic, micro-economic and employment aspects. While the overall goal of growth and employment is intrinsic to all of them, certain Guidelines can be considered to deal more closely with the issue of creating a more competitive and attractive environment for job creation within the EU, such as promoting growth and employment through an oriented and efficient allocation of resources, investment in R&amp;D, facilitating all forms of innovation, strengthening the competitive advantages of the EU’s industrial base, more entrepreneurial culture and creating a supportive environment for SMEs, the functioning of labour markets, as well as labour cost developments and wage-setting mechanisms.</p>
<p>A Communication is awaited from the Commission concerning the future strategy.</p>
<p>Concerning specifically the European Employment Strategy after 2010, it is envisaged that, on 30 November 2009, the Council will hold a political debate on ‘Recovering from the crisis and preparing for the post-2010 Lisbon Strategy’. To prepare the Council’s debate, the Employment Committee has already submitted an Opinion on the European Employment Strategy within the post-2010 Lisbon Agenda<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In this Opinion, the Employment Committee considers that the labour market reforms on both the supply and demand side should stimulate more and better jobs for all.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The EU’s commitment towards human rights is well known. In its external relations, the EU constantly insists on the need to respect fully human rights. The Presidency is very well aware of the concerns felt by many in this Parliament about the Human rights situation in Russia, and as we indicated during the recent debate in this plenary on the EU-Russia Summit, we fully share your concerns. The Council is indeed aware of the recent reports by the International Federation of Journalists, and the Committee to Protect Journalists, as well as other international non-governmental organisations, regarding the dangers and violence faced by journalists and human rights defenders in Russia, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p>As the Presidency stated already in the OSCE on 3 September, we share the assessment that as long as these crimes remain unsolved, a climate of impunity will continue to prevail in Russia and perpetrators will feel they can continue to carry out such acts. Assaults on journalists and human rights defenders pose a particular threat to democracy, the respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>The Presidency, on behalf of the European Union Member States, condemned publicly and resolutely recurrent cases of threats, assault and murders against journalists and human rights defenders in Russia, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus, and urged the Russian authorities to swiftly and thoroughly investigate those cases and to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
<p>The European Union frequently raises its concerns about the security of human rights defenders and the climate of impunity with Russia, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. At the EU-Russia Summit in Stockholm, the Presidency raised its increasing concern over the situation for human rights defenders in Russia. Recent human rights consultations with Russia, which took place on 4-5 November 2009 in Stockholm, focused largely on freedom of expression and the situation of human rights defenders, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus. In the context of EU-Russia political dialogue, the European Union requested information about the investigation into the individual cases of murders of journalists and human rights defenders. The European Union will continue to monitor the trials of prominent human rights defenders and journalists in Russia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Presidency organised several meetings with Russia and international NGOs to address recent increased violence against the HRD in the Northern Caucasus, and attended an NGO conference in Stockholm on 27-28 October 2009 which formulated recommendations for EU action.</p>
<p>The European Union proposed to cooperate with Russia on concrete projects in order to improve the situation of journalists and human rights defenders. I can assure the honourable Member that the Council is committed to continue its actions in order to improve the human rights situation in Russia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0409"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations remains key. The Council has urged both parties to take immediate steps to resume peace negotiations, respecting previous agreements and understandings, and has called on both parties to implement their obligations under the Roadmap. The Council considers that all actors must contribute to an environment conducive to resume negotiations and continues to support the US efforts to this effect.</p>
<p>The Council remains deeply concerned by settlement activities, house demolitions and evictions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem. It urges the government of Israel to immediately end settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001. In the Council’s view, settlements are illegal under international law and constitute an obstacle to peace. The Council has also urged the Palestinian Authority to continue to make every effort to improve law and order.</p>
<p>The European Union remains concerned at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for the immediate and unconditional opening of Gaza crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons. Reconstruction and economic recovery has to be allowed. It calls on those holding the abducted Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, to release him without delay.</p>
<p>The Council has expressed continued encouragement for President Mahmoud Abbas and support for the mediation efforts by Egypt and the Arab League. Overcoming divisions among Palestinians would help prevent a deeper separation between the West Bank and Gaza and preserve the chances of restoring the unity of a future Palestinian state. The Council calls on all Palestinians to find common ground, based on non-violence, in order to improve the situation in Gaza and the organisation of elections.</p>
<p>The EU has urged Arab countries and other partners to be forthcoming, both politically and financially, in assisting the Palestinian Authority, in accordance with Roadmap provisions. Underlining the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, the EU invites Israel and all Arab countries to take confidence building measures in order to overcome mutual mistrust and to create an atmosphere conducive to conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Solutions to the various conflicts including a lasting settlement for the conflicts between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon must be pursued in parallel, creating mutually reinforcing processes. In this regard, the EU expects that Syria and Israel resume peace negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0413"></a>

If further powers of supervision were to be given to the European Central Bank, recourse should be made to the enabling clause enshrined in paragraph 6 of that same Article. Therefore, so far, the oversight of the banking sector has essentially remained with the Member States.</p>
<p>In this context, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) gives advice to the European Commission on policy and regulatory issues related to banking supervision and promotes cooperation and convergence of supervisory practice across the European Union. However, neither the ESCB (European System of Central Banks), including the ECB, nor the CEBS, exercise any direct supervisory power of the banking sector.</p>
<p>In June 2009, the European Council stated that the financial crisis had clearly demonstrated the need to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, both in Europe and globally.</p>
<p>On the same occasion, the European Council also recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities (ESA), be established aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups through the setting up of supervisory colleges and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. The European Council further agreed ‘that the European System of Financial Supervisors should have binding and proportionate decision-making powers in respect of whether supervisors are meeting their requirements under a single rule book and relevant Community law and in the case of disagreement between the home and host state supervisors, including within colleges of supervisors. ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies.’</p>
<p>The Commission has now submitted to the Council and the Parliament in September this year - as part of the overall legislative package for a new financial supervisory architecture for the EU - a proposal to establish a European Banking Authority.</p>
<p>The aim of the proposal, which is currently under examination both in the Parliament and in the Council, is to strengthen the supervisory arrangements in the banking sector in line with the recommendations of the group of high level experts, chaired by Mr de Larosière.</p>
<p>As the legislative proposals are under codecision procedure, the Council will cooperate closely with Parliament with a view to achieving an agreement on the proposals in first reading as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0420"></a>

<p>In a bid to forestall any protests during the International Climate Change Conference, the Danish authorities are envisaging new, even more repressive, measures which are a blatant infringement of fundamental democratic rights.</p>
<p>Government recommendations include preventive detention for up to twelve hours, 40-day prison sentences for ‘obstructing police officers in the performance of their duty’, fines of up to €1 000 for ‘disorderly conduct’ or ‘participation in gatherings, the purpose of which is judged by police officers to be suspect’, and prison sentences of up to fifty days for disturbance of the peace or damage to property. It is also proposed that police officers be provided with additional equipment in the form of video cameras and surveillance equipment for the monitoring of locations considered by the police to be potential trouble spots. Measures are also being discussed seeking to prevent foreign activists from entering Copenhagen and taking part in demonstrations.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council is not aware of the measures proposed by the Danish Government mentioned by the honourable Member of Parliament. Moreover, by virtue of Article 33 of the Treaty on European Union (Article 72 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union from 1 December 2009), measures related to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security are a national competence of individual Member States. The Council is therefore of the opinion that it lacks competence to take a position as regards possible policing measures taken by the Danish Government in this field.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would like to recall that, having regard to the European Union’s objective to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the field of police cooperation, the Council has adopted in December 2007 a Recommendation<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning a Handbook for police and security authorities concerning cooperation at major events with an international dimension. The Council recommended that Member States, inter alia, step up cooperation, in particular, practical cooperation and information exchange.</p>
<p>In this sense, in the framework of the meeting of the Police Chiefs Task Force of 19 October 2009, Denmark has asked for Member States’ support both in terms of information exchange and the deployment of officers. Such cooperation is regular practice for Member States’ authorities in the case of major events. The Council is not involved in planning and implementation of such measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

What steps has the Commission taken, in addition to initiatives such as the Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors Scheme promoting women entrepreneurs, to ensure that its initiatives address properly the practical requirements for setting up in business, such as access to finance?

<p>(EN) Improving access to finance for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is crucial for entrepreneurship, competitiveness, innovation and growth. Therefore, the Commission has, for years, recognised the importance of access to finance, including for new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>An important issue in this context is to improve the availability of risk capital, especially to young SMEs with high growth potential.</p>
<p>There are many supply side gaps to be addressed – attracting more investments in venture capital funds, encouraging more investments by these funds and by business angels, offering a variety of exit opportunities. On the other hand, there are demand side issues that hinder businesses from achieving their full potential – for example, investment readiness of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The financial instruments of the Competitiveness and the Innovation Framework Programme contribute to addressing the lack of private funding sources, in particular, in seed and start-up phases of business development. Over €1 billion is made available in the years 2007-13, and the leverage effect of this funding should result in some 400 000 SMEs benefiting from lending or equity investment that would not otherwise be available. Under EU Cohesion Policy, Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) is targeting improved access to finance for SMEs and new business creation. Some €3.1 billion from operational programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) have been legally committed so far to be invested in SMEs under JEREMIE. The European Investment Bank has also increased its lending to SMEs to €30 billion for 2008-2011 to boost SMEs’ access to credit to counter the crunch of the financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>The Small Business Act (SBA) of June 2008 includes the Commission’s key policies supporting SMEs and entrepreneurs, including improving their access to bank credit and speeding up reforms. It aims to improve the overall approach to entrepreneurship, consolidate the ‘think small first’ principle in the Commission and Member States initiatives and policy making, and help SMEs tackle the remaining problems which hamper their development.</p>
<p>The SBA includes measures on investment readiness of entrepreneurs, increasing the capacity of an SME or an entrepreneur to understand the concerns of banks, business angels or venture capital funds – providers of external financing. A Workshop on investment readiness for women entrepreneurs held in September 2009 identified a range of support services in the field of investment readiness for female entrepreneurs in Europe and discussed how existing investment readiness schemes could be adapted to the needs of women entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Equality between men and women is also a specific objective of the EU Cohesion Policy. This objective is implemented through a twofold approach:</p>
<p>With cofinancing of the ERDF and the ESF (European Social Fund), Member States and regions develop many projects targeted at women to stimulate their integration in the labour market. They include measures and projects to facilitate access to finance for female entrepreneurs and to stimulate and support financially their entrepreneurial drive and creativity.</p>
<p>The design of the Operational Programmes of the Cohesion Policy takes into account the impact on gender equality as well as the impact on other specific target groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the framework of reducing administrative burden, the Commission is also working on reducing costs and time to start up a company. There was a specific time limit set in 2006 for starting up a company in Europe - one week or less. The Commission is tracking the progress and supporting Member States in their efforts to achieve this target: in 2007, the average time was 12 days and cost €485; in 2009, it went down to 8 days and €417.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to closely monitor progress in SME policy in the context of the Lisbon Partnership for Growth and Jobs.</p>
<p>It will soon present a report on the implementation of the SBA.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0373"></a>

<p>Economic growth is one of the EU’s basic objectives. Attaining this objective depends on many factors, including a properly functioning labour market in the EU. It is one of the desiderata of EU immigration policy that immigration should be linked to demand in the labour market, and achieving this objective could contribute decisively to growth. It might also prove beneficial, both for Member States experiencing pressure of immigration and for immigrants themselves who are effectively at a disadvantage as regards access to the labour market. At the same time, it may make legal immigration more attractive and curb the phenomenon of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>(EN) Over the last decade, the importance of labour immigration for employment in Europe has grown. In the next decade, the Union will have a rapidly ageing and shrinking workforce. The EU working-age population, which grew over the last decade, would start declining by over one million a year on average in the period 2010 to 2020. In the absence of immigration inflows, these trends would accelerate dramatically. Managing immigration successfully is therefore becoming a key point in the structural reforms needed to address the challenges of population ageing and of sustaining economic growth.</p>
<p>Despite the significant contribution of immigration to employment and growth, there are several issues with managing immigrant labour in the EU. The employment rates of immigrants and, in particular, certain categories of immigrants with low educational qualifications, female immigrants and recent arrivals, are below average. Immigration also often involves ‘brain waste’, where skilled workers are employed in low-skilled jobs. In addition, there are signs of rising discrimination and xenophobia in the current employment crisis.</p>
<p>The post-2010 strategy will need to address these issues by supplementing recent Commission policy initiatives on admission rules and irregular recruitment with policy action to realise the full potential of labour immigration flows for employment and growth. EU action should involve incentives for immigrants to take up work and support for labour-market infrastructure to meet the often specific needs of immigrant workers. The European Social Fund could support these priorities. While the focus may vary from country to country, special attention should be paid to the gender dimension and the fight against discrimination and xenophobia across the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0374"></a>

<p>(EN) As demographic change is a challenge common to all EU Member States, the Commission has focused on the promotion of a shared, long-term strategy. In its 2006 Communication: ‘The demographic future of Europe – from challenge to opportunity’<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission identified five key policy responses to ageing: (1) demographic renewal, (2) more and better employment, (3) increased productivity, (4) migration and integration and (5) sustainable public finances. These five policy goals remain relevant and have been confirmed in the recent Communication on ‘Dealing with the impact of an ageing population in the EU’<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission’s objective is to help the Member States, which are responsible for implementing the necessary policies in response to demographic change, manage the effects of this phenomenon in the best possible way. The Lisbon Strategy provides the general framework for this. In addition, the Commission promotes the European debate on demographic change, and provides a platform for the exchange of experience and mutual learning, through the European Demography Forum and the European Demography Report<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, both occurring on a two-year basis. Furthermore, the Commission also appointed an advisory group of government experts on demographic issues in 2007.</p>
<p>Even though family policy is the exclusive responsibility of the Member States, the Commission can play a useful role. With this in mind, the Commission supports the European Alliance for Families launched by the European Council in the spring of 2007. The European Alliance for Families serves as a platform for the exchange of knowledge and good practice on family-friendly policies in the Member States. The Commission has launched a number of initiatives to facilitate exchange between the Member States, such as the creation of a web portal, the organisation of best practice seminars, the setting up of a network of academic experts, the publication of a brochure on how to finance projects on family friendliness through EU Structural Funds, and cooperation with the OECD on a family database.</p>
<p>It is difficult to identify the most effective family policies in Europe as the Member States pursue different policy objectives. In some Member States, the priority is to increase the national birth rate by helping couples achieve their family plans. In others, support for family life is part of a wider project promoting equality between men and women. Some countries regard measures to combat child poverty, or to reduce inequalities in income, as the best approach. Information on how Member States achieve these different objectives can be found in different reports produced regularly by the Commission (e.g. the Report on Equality between Men and Women<a href="#defann_26_4" name="refann_26_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion<a href="#defann_26_5" name="refann_26_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, the Social Situation Report<a href="#defann_26_6" name="refann_26_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, and the European Demography Report).</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission informs the honourable Member that it has not commissioned a specific study on the scope for, and the possible consequences of, a ‘child-raising salary’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission adopted a Communication on ‘A Shared Commitment for Employment’ in June as a response to the effect of the crisis on the employment situation. The Communication sets out three key priorities for action: maintaining employment, creating jobs, and promoting mobility; upgrading skills and matching labour market needs; and increasing access to employment. Those three key priorities were endorsed by the June European Council. The Communication also proposes mobilising the EU financial instruments in order to help the Member States’ recovery efforts, namely the European Structural Funds and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).</p>
<p>The EGF aims to show solidarity with, and provide support to, workers made redundant as a consequence of major structural changes in world trade patterns or (until the end of 2011) as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. The recent revision of the EGF regulation makes it easier for the Member States to access the Fund, and to provide assistance to a greater number of workers over a longer period.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has suggested a new instrument of micro-financing in order to give micro-credits and guarantees to people having lost their job and wishing to create their own enterprise.</p>
<p>The worst of the financial crisis seems to be over. Indications show that GDP decline has levelled out and stock markets are recovering. However, the labour market situation remains poor, with unemployment predicted to rise further still. Discussions have already begun on possible exit strategies, which will lead the EU economies out of recession. It is essential that these exit strategies are implemented in such a way and at such a time which will not jeopardise the labour markets’ recovery. As the economy begins to improve, the key labour market focus will switch to one of ensuring crisis measures have an impact in terms of addressing longer term structural reforms needs, and do not hamper necessary restructuring. In the context of current and future budgetary constraints, it is particularly important to assess and, where needed, improve the effectiveness of labour market measures.</p>
<p>The Commission’s role is to coordinate both the recovery measures and exit strategies across Europe, given that many of the measures adopted by the Member States are likely to have spillover effects. Structural reforms that promote growth through higher productivity and better use of the labour force will be of crucial importance.</p>
<p>Exit strategies for labour market policies need to shift focus from short-term measures which aim to prevent the further laying off of workers towards more productive structural measures. This shift will aim to stimulate job creation and growth through an increase in labour supply, facilitating positive transitions in the labour market, and to prevent long-term unemployment from getting entrenched.</p>
<p>The Member States’ exit strategies will need to be reflected in the Lisbon Strategy and the European Employment Strategy after 2010. The need for structural reform will be central to the future strategy, taking account of the macro-economic situation in each Member State. In this connection, the Commission underlines that the current crisis has required extraordinary support from macro-economic policies, including budgetary policies. However, the effectiveness of such support depends on it being temporary. Otherwise, expectations of future tax increases will induce higher savings. Furthermore, in the absence of sufficient fiscal margins, a continuation of expansionist budgetary policies may turn out to be unsustainable. Accordingly, the Council has agreed on 20 October 2009 that there is a need for timely withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus. Provided that the Commission forecasts continue to indicate that the recovery is strengthening and becoming self-sustaining, fiscal consolidation in all EU Member States should start in 2011 at the latest. Specificities of country situations should be taken into account, and a number of countries need to consolidate before then.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a document on 24 November 2009 presenting its initial reflections on the broad policy orientations for the future EU 2020 strategy and seeking the views of all relevant stakeholders. The Commission intends to present its proposals for the future EU 2020 strategy at the beginning of 2010 in time for the Spring European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0393"></a>

<p>(EN) Responses to the crisis, particularly its consequences on employment, are, first and foremost, the responsibilities of the Member States. The Commission has, however, taken a number of initiatives to counter the impact of the financial and economic crisis on the labour market since the crisis hit in autumn 2008.</p>
<p>In November 2008, the Commission adopted the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP). The Plan calls for coordinated action across the Member States and for ‘smart’ investments which should bring long-lasting benefits for the Union. It also highlights the importance of implementing integrated flexicurity policies in order to protect European citizens from the adverse effects of the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Latest indications show that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decline has levelled out and stock markets are recovering. However, the labour market situation is still grim with unemployment predicted to rise further still. The Member States and the Commission have therefore started discussing possible exit strategies which will lead economies out of recession. It is, however, essential that these exit strategies are implemented at such a time which will not jeopardise the labour markets’ recovery.</p>
<p>The Commission’s role is to coordinate both the recovery measures and exit strategies across Europe, given that many of the measures adopted by the Member States are likely to have spillover effects. Existing short-term measures need to be replaced by new measures to address structural challenges. Promoting job creation and keeping people in the labour force will be essential to achieve this.</p>
<p>The EERP highlights the importance of the European Social Fund (ESF) in alleviating the effects of the crisis. The EU has introduced important changes in order to facilitate access to the ESF, including:</p>
<p>- extending the eligibility date for the 2000-2006 programmes to 30 June 2009, making it possible for Member States to use unspent funding of €7 billion;</p>
<p>- increasing the advance payments for the 2007-2013 programmes, which includes an additional €1.76 billion from the ESF to Member States. In total, more than €6.1 billion was allocated to Member States in advance payments between 2007 and 2009;</p>
<p>- in order to start implementing ESF programmes as quickly as possible, the Member States were advised that the ESF would meet 100% of the costs for starting up potential projects if national funding was not immediately available, as long as the Member States were able to continue financing the projects themselves towards the end of the programming period;</p>
<p>- the possibility of making use of flat rate payments was extended, thus proving to be beneficial for very small projects which could receive a lump sum payment of up to €50 000.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2013, Lithuania should receive a Structural Fund allocation of €5.9 billion, of which €1 billion will be sourced directly from the ESF. This financial support should help Lithuania tackle the negative consequences of the crisis and prepare for recovery.</p>
<p>In July 2009, at the request of the Lithuanian authorities, the Commission amended the Lithuanian ESF Operational Programme for Human Resources Development. National funding was reduced to the minimum 15% required by the Structural Funds regulations and financial support for the setting up of new businesses was made available. This measure is of particular importance for Lithuania where access to finance by businesses, especially very small ones, is difficult.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lithuania has applied for a contribution from the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) to combat large scale redundancies. The application concerning Alytaus Tekstile was approved by the Budgetary Authority in 2008. Four other applications from Lithuania are currently under examination by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0397"></a>

<p>(EN) Designing and implementing responses to the crisis, particularly its consequences on the employment and social situation, are, first and foremost, the responsibilities of the Member States. The Commission recalls that on average, the Member States devote 27% of their gross domestic product (GDP) to social protection policies. This being so, the EU can play an important role in assisting the Member States in their efforts to tackle the adverse effects of the crisis through policy coordination and mobilisation of the EU financial instruments.</p>
<p>The Open Method of Coordination for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (Social OMC) supports Member States’ efforts through mutual learning and networking activities, the development of statistical tools and indicators, and improving the knowledge base for policy design. In response to the current situation, voluntary exchanges of information on the social situation and policy responses have been organised within the Social Protection Committee. Furthermore, updates are published regularly in the form of Joint Assessments by the Commission and the Social Protection Committee. The second Joint Assessment will be presented to the Council of Ministers on 30 November 2009.</p>
<p>The current crisis calls for speedy social inclusion strategies which focus on providing adequate minimum income, strengthening links to the labour market and access to quality services. The Social Protection Committee is responsible for monitoring the implementation of social inclusion strategies in the Member States. Furthermore, as part of the monitoring of progress under the social OMC, the Commission is in the process of finalising the draft 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion which will focus on housing and homelessness. The Report will provide information on progress achieved to date and identify messages for future policy work in these areas.</p>
<p>The EU recognises the importance of combating poverty and social exclusion, and has devoted considerable funding from the European Social Fund (ESF) to this cause. The ESF benefits those already suffering from social exclusion and supports actions to prevent and reduce poverty through early intervention. Such measures include skills and knowledge development, enhancing workers’ adaptability and combating early school drop-out.</p>
<p>The operational programmes under the ESF were decided before the crisis hit. However, the Member States have the possibility of asking the Commission to agree to amend their operational programmes. Some Member States have done so while others have been able to use the existing operational programmes to respond to the adverse effects of the crisis.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that the Member States are entirely responsible for the implementation of policies and for the achievement of the programmes’ objectives. Assessment on whether these objectives have been met is carried out in line with guidance from Commission Regulations which apply to the Structural Funds. For example, ESF beneficiaries can be divided into different groups of vulnerability such as migrants or the disabled, or by their status in the labour market as either long-term unemployed or inactive citizens. Each Member State is able to add more criteria which reflect their individual circumstances.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0403"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission points out that the underlying aim of flexicurity is to strike the right balance between security and flexibility, both indispensable to the effective support of workers and to ease the adaptation of companies.</p>
<p>Flexicurity involves a combination of measures which aim to keep people in employment and to assist those who have lost their jobs in their return to the labour market. It does this by ensuring that any transition to a new job runs as smoothly as possible, and that the transition itself is a move which improves the worker’s prospects.</p>
<p>The Common Principles of Flexicurity adopted by the Member States in December 2007 stress that sufficient contractual flexibility must be accompanied by secure transitions from job to job. Flexicurity should promote more open, responsive and inclusive labour markets, and avoid labour market segmentation. Those in unstable employment or on the fringes of the labour market need to be provided with better opportunities, economic incentives and support measures to ease their access to work.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that flexicurity is an important aspect of labour market policy which will help to confront the current economic and social challenges. The European Council recently confirmed the importance of flexicurity in bringing about economic recovery and reducing unemployment.</p>
<p>Council Directive 1999/70/EC<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> requires the Member States to establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.

<p>The Commission also points out that it has been in contact with the Greek Ministry of Labour on the subject of public sector apprenticeships. In this connection, the Commission has indicated that work experience can ease the transition from education to the working world, but also stressed that these schemes needed careful planning, strict selection procedures and close monitoring in order to ensure that the scheme in question improves the employment prospects of participants and benefits persons in need.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) About 40 000 tonnes of chemical munitions were dumped into the Baltic Sea after World War II – mostly in the area to the east of Bornholm, southeast of Gotland and south of the Little Belt. The Community is a Contracting Party to the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM)<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which has performed monitoring and assessment regarding dumping of chemical weapons in the Baltic Sea. HELCOM published a report on the dumping sites and the quantity and quality of the chemical munitions already in 1994. Amongst the Contracting Parties of HELCOM, Denmark is responsible for an annual follow-up on the number of incidents and reporting these to HELCOM. Since 1995, a total of 101 incidents have been reported. Between 1995 and 1999, an average of 7 incidents per year were reported. The number of incidents reported increased in the following years and was, on average, 14 per year between 2000 and 2003. However, since 2004, it has again decreased: on average, 3 incidents per year were reported during 2004 to 2007, while in 2008, no (0) incidents were reported. The incidents were related to fishing activities. These variations are probably due to a combination of factors such as the intensity of fishing activities in the areas close to the dumped chemical munitions and the Recommendations issued by HELCOM and the local authorities. Dumping areas are marked as foul, with ‘anchoring and fishing not recommended’, on nautical charts. However, fishing in these waters is not prohibited and commercial fishing continues. HELCOM provides comprehensive information on its Internet site<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, including information on how to handle situations where chemical weapons are netted by fishermen.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an EU funded research project ‘Modelling of ecological risks related to sea-dumped chemical weapons’ (MERCW). The main objective of the project is to carry out focused research and technology developments in order to model the transport pathways and migration spreading of toxic agents in marine sediments and the marine environment. The final goal is to assess the ecological safety for the ecosystem and health impacts on people of the coastal states near the dump sites. The first public report<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the MERCW project includes a thorough and detailed analysis of the different dumpsites, and it forms the starting point for all other activities within the project. The research project regularly reports its findings to HELCOM. The present conclusions are that the dumped chemical weapons constitute a very low risk for the marine environment through leakage of toxic substances from the dumped ammunitions, and there is no indication that it could be a risk for public health through consumption of fish.</p>
<p>In general, a large number of research projects have been funded on the human health impacts of chemicals by the EU research Framework Programmes<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Some projects, such as COMPARE<a href="#defann_32_5" name="refann_32_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, included population studies around the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>On 29 October 2009, the Commission put forward a proposal to the Parliament and the Council for a Joint Baltic Sea Research Programme (BONUS-169). This initiative brings together all 8 EU Member States surrounding the Baltic Sea in developing a strategic, policy-driven, research agenda and implementing a fully integrated joint research programme. During the first phase of the Joint Research Programme, a Strategic Research Agenda will be drawn up. This will be based on the results of extensive and widespread stakeholder consultation, including with interested parties from other relevant non-marine natural sciences, the social and economic sciences and from other geographical areas. The complex problems related to the dumping of ammunition in the Baltic Sea Region could be one of the issues discussed with a view to funding targeted calls for research proposals during the implementation phase of the initiative.</p>
<p>Building on the monitoring work carried out so far by both HELCOM and the MERCW project, the European Union’s Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region<a href="#defann_32_6" name="refann_32_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> includes a specific flagship project which aims to ‘Assess the need to clean up contaminated wrecks and chemical weapons’. This project, to be coordinated by Poland, is to include activities which encompass identification of the current priority threats and establishment of the costs and benefits of any possible action through agreed research programmes. It will build on existing knowledge and mapping in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Further, the objective of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive<a href="#defann_32_7" name="refann_32_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> is that all European marine waters shall have Good Environmental Status by 2020. To reach this objective, all Member States are obliged to assess and monitor the concentrations of contaminants, all elements in the marine food chains, contaminants in fish and other seafood, etc. In particular, implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive will have to be based on cooperation and coordination of Member States in the catchment area of a marine region or subregion such as the Baltic Sea, and shall, as far as possible, build upon existing programmes and activities developed within international agreements such as HELCOM. The levels for Good Environmental Status will have to be regionally coordinated, and decided by 2012, and by 2014, all Member States shall have their monitoring programmes in place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not agree with the premise of the question, namely that the three new Commissioners – Algirdas Šemeta, Pawel Samecki and Karel De Gucht – will probably only remain in office for a short time.</p>
<p>The Commission can only answer the first question when indeed one of the three Commissioners mentioned will claim the re-installation allowance when ceasing to hold office. The Commission can, however, confirm that the re-installation allowance will be paid upon departure if the former Commissioner has to change residence and is not entitled to a similar allowance for the same purpose in his/her new activities.</p>
<p>With regard to the second question, the Commission wishes to point out that according to Regulation 422/67/EEC, there is no minimum term of mandate in order to receive the transitional allowance. If the mandate is less than two years, he/she will be entitled to the transitional allowance for 3 years. The transitional allowance is there as the quid pro quo of imposing limits (under Article 213 EC) on the activities a Commissioner can take on immediately after leaving office, and thus to prevent conflict of interest. The duty to act with discretion as regards future employment applies equally whether the Commissioner has been in office 3 weeks or 10 years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Hellenic Shipyards of Skaramanga and the German company HDW (members of the German ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Group) have announced that they are to terminate contracts concluded with the Greek Government to build four submarines and carry out maintenance on three others because the Greek Government owes the company €524 million. However, the Greek Ministry of Defence is refusing to pay that sum and take delivery of the first of the submarines owing to confirmed stability problems. Moreover, the Greek Government has, in fact, already paid 80% of the total sum due for the seven submarines. The German company’s tactic could be described as blackmail since termination of the contracts means, in effect, that the shipyards would go out of business, leaving the 2 000 workers at the Skaramanga yards jobless.

<p>(EN) The honourable Member is enquiring about the Commission’s view on the guarantees granted to the Dutch greenhouses sector.</p>
<p>The Dutch scheme provides for the possibility for the Guarantee Fund to grant State aid under the form of guarantees for a maximum of 80% of the guaranteed loan. The maximum amount of the guarantee is €2 500 000.

<p>The French satellite provider Eutelsat is continuing to broadcast the Al-Aqsa TV television channel even though the content of the latter’s programmes is in direct violation of Article 3b of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2007/65/EC<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). Such programmes also contribute to growing radicalisation in Europe, presenting a threat to European security. Al-Aqsa TV is owned, funded and controlled by Hamas, an organisation on the EU’s terrorist list. In December 2008 the French broadcasting authority, the Conseil Supérieur de l’Audiovisuel, informed Eutelsat that the content of Al-Aqsa TV’s programmes breached Article 15 of the French communication law of 30 September 1986, which prohibits all forms of incitement to hatred or violence on the grounds of race, religion or nationality. Notwithstanding the CSA’s communication, Eutelsat is still carrying Al-Aqsa TV, whose programmes continue to violate European and French audiovisual legislation.</p>
<p>What measures does the Commission plan to take to stop Al-Aqsa TV being broadcast by a European satellite provider?

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concern with regard to programmes containing incitement to hatred falling under the jurisdiction of a Member State. It actively cooperates closely with, and promotes cooperation between, the Member States in order to ensure the full application of Community law in this particularly sensitive area.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Al-Aqsa TV is transmitted via Atlantic Bird 4 belonging to the French-based satellite operator Eutelsat. Services via Atlantic Bird 4 are accessible mostly in Middle Eastern countries. Within the European Union, EU citizens in southern Italy, Cyprus, Malta and Greece are the only ones who may access this channel with standard equipment. In other EU countries, wide satellite dishes would be necessary for the reception of the programmes of Al-Aqsa TV. It has also to be noted that the Commission has not received so far any formal complaint regarding the programmes broadcast by Al-Aqsa TV.</p>
<p>While Article 22a of Directive 89/552/EEC prohibits broadcasts inciting to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality, the right of freedom of expression is a cornerstone of a democratic and pluralist society. There is sometimes a very thin delineation between freedom of expression and incitement to hatred. In this regard, a total ban on a television channel is a very radical measure and must remain exceptional.</p>
<p>The Commission formally wrote to the French broadcasting authority, the ‘Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel’ (CSA) regarding Al-Aqsa TV in September 2008. Following this inquiry, and taking into account the intention of Al-Aqsa TV to target all European Union countries via Eurobird 9, a European telecoms satellite operated by Eutelsat, the CSA issued a warning (mise en garde) against Eutelsat in December 2008. As a result, the CSA ensured that Al-Aqsa TV did not materialise its intention to target the whole European Union audience. On 23 October 2009, the Commission wrote to the French authorities asking for the follow-up to the CSA’s 2008 decision.</p>
<p>In general, the Commission, as guardian of the treaty, may start infringement procedures against Member States if it assesses that the Member State in question does not comply with Community law. With regard to France’s handling of Al-Aqsa TV, the Commission may make use of this possibility depending on the answer to the abovementioned letter.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission regularly raises the issue of broadcasts by Al-Aqsa TV and other broadcasters in a political dialogue with the countries concerned, be it the country of origin of these broadcasters, the country where the uplink to the satellite is located, or a country whose satellite capacity is used for these broadcasts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The existence of a significant information deficit about the EU in Ireland has been evidenced by research findings and by the conclusions of the Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament) sub-committee’s report of November 2008 on Ireland’s future in the European Union.</p>
<p>In response to a demand for factual information about the EU, the European Parliament and the European Commission signed a three year Memorandum of Understanding on Communicating Europe in Partnership with the Irish Government in January 2009.</p>
<p>In the framework of this memorandum, and in close cooperation with the Irish Government and the European Parliament Office in Ireland, a wide range of activities have been undertaken with the aim of promoting greater public understanding of the EU in Ireland.</p>
<p>The Commission organised activities such as eleven public discussions about the EU across Ireland, a nation-wide advertising initiative showing what the EU does for consumers, a secondary schools’ essay competition and internet activities, like a new interactive website and internet social networking. In the framework of the initiative called ‘Back to School’, which involves officials working for the European institutions going back to visit their former high schools, some 87 Irish officials visited 101 schools in 24 counties.</p>
<p>The Commission also organised, in conjunction with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, a number of briefing sessions, entitled ‘The facts about the Lisbon Treaty’ for the interested organisations, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and regional authorities. Six listening events organised together with Irelands’ main women’s organisations also took place in 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0386"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the introduction of the Citizens’ initiative which will give a stronger voice to the European Union citizens, add a new dimension to European democracy and complement the set of rights related to the citizenship of the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that European citizens should benefit from the European Citizens’ Initiative as quickly as possible after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. To that end, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a Regulation on the basis of Article 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union after the Treaty enters into force. The Commission’s ambition would be to make it possible for the Regulation to be adopted before the end of the first year after the entry into force of the Treaty and it trusts that the European Parliament and Council will share this objective.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the future proposal for citizens, organised civil society, stakeholders and public authorities in the Member States, citizens and all interested parties need to have the opportunity to give their views on how the citizens’ initiative should work.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore adopted on 11 November a Green Paper<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in order to seek the views of all interested parties on the key issues that will shape the future Regulation. The Commission hopes that the consultation will encourage a wide range of responses. The results of this consultation will serve as a basis for the preparation of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission very much welcomes Parliament’s resolution on the citizens’ initiative adopted in May 2009 as a valuable contribution to this debate, and shares most of its suggestions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The current Community rules on individual identification and traceability of sheep and goats were prompted by the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 in the United Kingdom (UK), and the subsequent reports of Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the so-called ‘Anderson report’ to the UK House of Commons that indicated that the existing ‘batch’ identification and traceability system was unreliable. At that time, key stakeholders like the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) not only called for the introduction of individual traceability and electronic identification but even to ‘act ahead of the rest of the EU’.</p>
<p>For this reason, Council Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 introduced the system of electronic identification of small ruminants, which will become compulsory as from January 2010.</p>
<p>Voluntary electronic identification would mean in fact, voluntary traceability. A voluntary system would also mean an uneven playing field as a number of Member States are already far advanced in the process of introducing electronic identification.</p>
<p>The technology is now mature and ready for use in practical farming conditions.</p>
<p>Neither the Parliament nor the Council have ever challenged the basic provisions of the Regulation.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has facilitated the smooth introduction of the new system as far as possible in order to reduce costs and burdens for the operators, without challenging the principles of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

I regret to have to note that the Commission did not answer my questions at all in its reply to the written question. Several non-governmental organisations have already expressed doubts about the results and the quality of the studies.

<p>(FR) In response to this question, which follows on from the written question (<a href="/doceo/document/E-7-2009-4313_EN.html">E-4313/09</a>) submitted in October 2009 concerning the two studies commissioned by the Commission on the impact that the authorisation of longer and heavier goods vehicles (LHVs) could potentially have on intra-European traffic, the Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the response provided by the Commission was as precise as possible given the data available at that time.</p>
<p>The first study carried out at the request of the Commission by ‘Transport &amp; Mobility Leuven’ (T&amp;ML) in November 2008 concluded overall that more extensive use of LHVs would definitely have a positive effect on the overall efficiency of the transport sector in Europe thanks to the anticipated improvements in terms of the safety and environmental performance of road transport.</p>
<p>However, since their publication, the results of this study have been strongly criticised by stakeholders, not only from the point of view of the parameters used in relation to the elasticity of transport demand, but also because of the potential repercussions that more extensive use of these vehicles would have in terms of road safety and modal split.</p>
<p>That is why the Commission considered that a more thorough analysis of the subject was necessary, and it is in this context that a new study has been carried out by the Joint Research Centre-Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) in Seville. Although its conclusions are far less pronounced than those in the report by T&amp;ML, this new study does conclude that more extensive use of LHVs in intra-European traffic would reduce the number of journeys that are required at present with the existing smaller and lighter fleet.</p>
<p>It is important to stress that the hypotheses have not yet been proven in practice. The Commission therefore believes that prudence is required when drafting conclusions which, until now, have had to be provisional pending the outcome of additional research. Indeed, the caution used by the authors of these two studies is consistent with that used in other reports drafted by interest groups or Member States.</p>
<p>In order to take full account of the diversity of the opinions reflected in the honourable Member’s question, concerning subjects such as elasticity of demand, modal shift, the estimated rate of utilisation of LHVs and the impact on infrastructure costs, the Commission has already convened a steering group comprising representatives of the parties involved in analysing these issues. This steering group held its first meeting at the beginning of November 2009 and is in the process of proposing a series of approved economic parameters for another study, which is due to be launched in early 2010 (and for which the proposals, which have recently been submitted to the Commission, are being assessed).</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the issues raised will be examined in more detail as part of the new study. Lastly, as it has already stated on several occasions, the Commission will decide on the need to amend the legislation in force only after it has examined all of the consequences of adapting the rules on the weights and dimensions of LHVs, as laid down in Directive 96/53/EC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s main concern is that the increases in import tariffs are planned to be made permanent under the new Common External Tariff of the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus Customs Union, which should come into force from 1 January 2010.</p>
<p>The main focus of the Commission’s activities in recent weeks, therefore, has been to raise the EU’s concerns with the three Customs Union Members and to ask for these concerns to be taken into account when a final decision is made on the new Common External Tariff by the three Heads of State on 27 November 2009. The impact on automobiles and on harvesters has been identified by the Commission as priorities, along with a list of other products. Discussions continued last week and the issue was raised by the President of the Commission at the EU-Russia Summit in Stockholm on 18 November 2009. The Commissioner for Trade also discussed the issue at a bilateral meeting with Russian Economy Minister Nabiullina in the margins of the summit.</p>
<p>Although it was a promising sign that President Medvedev himself stated at the summit that Russia’s current protectionist measures had proved to be ineffective, it was also clear that the proposed Common External Tariff will come into force from 1 January 2010 unchanged. The Commission only received a promise that the recent tariff increases will not be made permanent and would be reviewed after the establishment of the Customs Union.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully committed to the fight against doping in sport and supports the development of efficient anti-doping measures in line with EU law provisions on fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>The Commission is in regular contact with the relevant institutions and organisations, notably with the European Parliament, the Member States, the Council of Europe and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to discuss matters related to the fight against doping. The issue of data protection and protection of privacy of individual sportspeople is one of the most important and sensitive topics. In this context, the Commission, following the opinion adopted in April 2009 by the ‘Article 29 Working Party’ set up under Directive 95/46/EC on Personal Data Protection, has asked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to revise the relevant International Standard for the Protection of Privacy and Personal Information. WADA has proceeded subsequently to a substantial revision of the Standard in order to comply with EU law. However, a certain number of issues remain under discussion, notably the question of proportionality regarding the ‘whereabouts rule’, especially in the light of other WADA Standards and practices.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission recognises that the fight against doping in top level sport justifies the implementation of doping controls to top elite athletes without notice and out of sport competitions. Nevertheless, controls must remain proportionate and their implementation respectful of individual rights of the athletes.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its close cooperation with the relevant institutions and organisations, including with the Council of Europe Expert Group on Anti-Doping and Data Protection. The work of this expert group will certainly contribute to reinforcing the dialogue with WADA on the guidelines for the implementation of the ‘whereabouts rule’, including issues raised by the honourable Member such as athletes’ recourse against decisions taken at national level and the proportionality of disciplinary measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0405"></a>

The international aspects of the follow-up investigations are also being coordinated by OLAF.</p>
<p>The case in question clearly demonstrates the importance and benefits of close, international cooperation and the Commission will continue to support and encourage actions aimed at ensuring synergies and a multi-agency and multidisciplinary approach to the fight against illicit cross-border crime.</p>
<p>In relation to cigarettes, for the last 14 years, OLAF has held an annual conference for investigators and intelligence staff working in the tobacco sector to exchange information on current and emerging threats and to cement operational relationships between the Member States, key third countries and international organisations.</p>
<p>In order to stimulate the type of cooperation referred to by the honourable Member, the Community provides financial support in the form of grants within the framework of the EU Programme ‘Prevention of and Fight Against Crime’, managed by the Commission’s Justice, Freedom and Security Directorate General. The total budget for this programme envisaged for the year 2010 is €85.88 million. The Hercule II Programme, managed by OLAF, supports projects promoting the protection of the Community’s financial interests, and aims to enhance trans-national and multi-disciplinary cooperation and the creation of networks in the Member States, acceding countries and candidate countries.

When is it expected that the Third energy package will be implemented in full, i.e. all EU Member States will have chosen their preferred model of unbundling (from the Full Unbundling, the Independent System Operator (ISO) and the Independent Transmission Operator (ITO)) and implemented their respective provisions?

<p>There is one trustee for each yard, whose role it is to keep the Commission informed of the progress made in the asset sale process and any potential difficulties encountered. To reach this goal, the trustees provide the Commission with monthly progress reports. The Monitoring Trustees have provided these monthly reports since the start of the sales process and have continued to do so to date. Their involvement in the process is limited to this supervisory role and they are not actively involved in the conduct and/or management of the sales process as such.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Trustees have, on different occasions, given the Commission valuable insight into the process and have allowed it to address a number of technical difficulties with the Polish authorities directly.</p>
<p>The Commission Decisions of 6 November 2008 foresaw that the implementation of the decisions would be completed by early June 2009. After the adoption of the two decisions, the shipyards have closed their economic activity, which can be restarted by the investors acquiring the yards’ assets following the completion of their purchase. Given that – relatively late in the sales process – the frontrunner failed to complete the acquisition of large parts of the yards, this original deadline had to be extended significantly.</p>
<p>The Commission’s role in relation to the sales process is to monitor the implementation of the two Commission Decisions of 6 November 2008 and the conditions contained therein. Only once the sales process has been completed will the Commission be able to take a final view on Poland’s compliance with these conditions.</p>
<p>The Commission is not competent to decide whether, in the context of the sales process, other irregularities occurred under applicable national rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As food security is a multifaceted issue, responding to that challenge requires the coordinated contribution of several policies and instruments. Further to the sector-specific actions pursued by the various Commissioners concerned, the College of Commissioners has regularly assessed the global food security situation and, in particular, since the 2008 agricultural commodity price increases.</p>
<p>The College of Commissioners addressed food security-related issues at the time of the adoption of the Communication on ‘Tackling the challenge of rising food prices. Directions for Action’ in May 2008. The Communication set the agenda for subsequent Commission actions in various areas, within the EU and at a global level.</p>
<p>In July 2008, the Commission attended the high level conference organised by the French Presidency at the European Parliament (‘Who will feed the world?’). Later on in July, the College had the opportunity to come back to food security when discussing the results of the G8 Leaders’ Summit in Hokkaido Toyako. In that context, the issue of the EU ‘Food Facility’ and its contribution to promote agricultural production in developing countries was referred to.</p>
<p>More recently, progress in the global efforts to fight food insecurity was discussed during the College debate on the results of the L’Aquila G8 Summit of 8-10 July, at the meeting of 14 July 2009. On that occasion, President Barroso stressed the importance of the shift from the concept of food aid to food assistance and of the significant financial and conceptual contributions from the EU, welcoming the momentum generated by the G8 Summit.</p>
<p>On 26 September 2009, the Commission was one of the main speakers at the roundtable ‘Partnering for Food Security’ organised by United Nations (UN) Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, and US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. At the event, organised in marge of the UN General Assembly, the Commission reaffirmed the principles and pledges agreed upon at the L’Aquila G8 Summit in July.</p>
<p>Last week, the President of the Commission, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and the Commissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid participated at the World Food Summit convened by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome, confirming once again the importance the Commission gives to global food security in international fora. The Food Facility was welcomed by FAO as a rapid response of the EU to the food crisis of 2007-2008.</p>
<p>Concerning future strategic proposals, the Commission has just launched on 16 November 2009 a wide, web-based consultation on an ‘issues paper’ to gather orientations and views from relevant stakeholders regarding the proposed rationale, scope, strategic objectives, approach and implementation of a revised food security policy framework for the EU (http://ec.europa.eu/development/how/consultation/index.cfm?action=viewcons&amp;id=4785&amp;lng=en). As the discussions during the FAO Summit in Rome demonstrated, a holistic approach to food security is crucial. At the EU level, this will be ensured through the Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) process.</p>
<p>Concerning the food security situation of the Union itself, the EU has been responding to recent challenges through the reform process of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has been ongoing for the past 15 years. We have focused on a number of policies, such as the switch from product to producer support, linked to the respect of basic land management standards, the provision of a market safety net through intervention and the reinforcement of rural development with more resources. These have boosted the production potential of European agriculture while also respecting the necessary territorial and environmental balance of farming in the EU. Analysis indicates that the projected level of farm productivity and competitiveness in the EU should enable its farm sector to respond to the growing domestic demand.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0419"></a>

<p>(EN) It is the responsibility of the Greek authorities to ensure that the operation of the quarry referred to by the honourable Member complies fully with applicable national and EU legislation.</p>
<p>As regards, in particular, the Natura 2000 site in question (‘Dikti: Omalos Viannou (Symi-Omalos)’ GR4310006), the authorisation and subsequent operation of the quarry has to be in line with the ecological values of the site, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Habitats Directive). In particular, according to Article 6(3) of the directive, any plan or project likely to have a serious impact on a Natura 2000 site, either alone or in combination with other plans or projects, has to be subject to an appropriate assessment in light of the site’s conservation objectives and can only be authorised if it does not affect the integrity of the site.</p>
<p>On the basis of information provided by the honourable Member, as well as in the context of written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-7-2009-4788_EN.html">E-4788/09</a> on the same issue, the Commission will contact the Greek authorities in order to obtain information on implementation of the aforementioned provisions.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment does not set any Community standard as regards the distance of projects from inhabited areas.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of the health and safety of workers in the extraction industries, this has long been recognised as a specific area of concern. As such, a body of EC legislation exists to define minimum requirements for the protection of workers. This can be found in the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC<a href="#defann_52_3" name="refann_52_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> which lays down the basic provisions for all workers to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work.

<p>(EN) In its proposal for fishing opportunities for the Black Sea in 2010<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission proposed to reduce the Community TAC for turbot by 24% compared to 2009. This reduction is in line with the advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the criteria of the Commission’s Communication on Fishing Opportunities for 2010<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Scientific experts from Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine in the Black Sea Working Group unequivocally stated in their report to STECF from July 2009<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> that ‘the current biomass of turbot is much lower compared to historical levels. The drop in abundance is consistent with the decreases in CPUE (catch per unit effort) and landings. Recruitment has increased since 2002 and positively influenced the SSB<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, but given that many small and immature turbot are caught by the fisheries, such a positive influence may not propagate in the next years. Fishing mortality of turbot is high’.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s view that there is a ‘wide divergence of views between the working group and the STECF’, it is correct to say that STECF considered that ‘the results of the most recent assessment conducted during the STECF-SGRST Working Group in Brest in July 2009 are not sufficiently reliable to use as the basis for quantitative management advice on fishing opportunities for 2010’. Therefore, in line with the advice given in the STECF plenary report of April 2009, STECF stated that the exploitation of turbot in the Black Sea should be kept at the lowest possible level in order to allow the stock to recover.</p>
<p>On that basis, STECF recommended that the TAC should be reduced by at least 25% and that recovery measures should be implemented including effort reductions and the introduction of more selective fishing gear.</p>
<p>On 20 November 2009, Council reached political agreement on the 2010 Black Sea TAC, with a reduction of the EU TAC for 2010 to 96 tonnes. In this context, fishing for turbot is not authorised before 15 February 2010. By this date, Bulgaria and Romania will also have to submit to the Commission complete management and control plans in order to ensure the sustainable management of the fishery. The respective quotas will decrease to 38 tonnes, with a corresponding decrease of the TAC to 76 tonnes, unless these plans are accepted by the Commission. However, the Commission also confirmed its readiness to actively cooperate with the authorities of these Member States to achieve the objective of a sustainable fishery.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
