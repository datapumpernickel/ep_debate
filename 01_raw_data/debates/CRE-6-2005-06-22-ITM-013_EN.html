<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Claude Juncker,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency is drawing to an end. Some will say ‘thank goodness’, but personally I am sorry it is ending and I should have liked to continue.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to assess the results. A number of observations can be made which I hope are undisputed. Firstly, we succeeded in leading the European Council or Council of Ministers to take a number of decisions in sectors which, at the start of the year, were acutely controversial. We reformed the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby ending a long period of uncertainty which had the potential to trigger a profound rift among the euro-zone Member States. Far from eliminating stability, we have added stability to the preventive aspects of the Pact. Nor have we introduced excessive flexibility as regards the Pact’s corrective role, but instead have made it read and feel more economic than automatic. As President of the Eurogroup, I shall work to ensure proper application and judicious interpretation of the Pact which, in future, will pay greater heed to its two equally vital dimensions, namely stability, combined with growth, and growth allied to stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament, the Commission and Council have been successful in giving fresh impetus to the Lisbon strategy. Reinforced competitiveness, increasing modernisation in both our attitudes and our economic policies, a renewed determination to innovate and do more in the field of research – these are the major planks of the new strategy, which neither created nor sought deadlock, as some people may initially have wished, either in the area of social cohesion – which has been restored as a major objective, one of the key aims of the European Union – or that of an appropriate environmental policy – which is emphatically not a threat to jobs and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(A mobile telephone rang. Mr Juncker paused)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Hello.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I know people often react to my speeches. The reaction is not usually quite so immediate.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the Lisbon strategy: we are changing the way it is applied. Member States, through national reform programmes, will take greater ownership of the strategy and thus become answerable to their national parliaments in the best national tradition of European texts and European commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The June European Council, held last Thursday and Friday, for the first time in its history approved integrated guidelines, an important event which, alas, has passed virtually unnoticed in the last few days. To those seeking to modernise the European Union, while giving the impression that others are opposed to modernisation, to those who want to respond to the new challenges facing the European Union while giving the impression that everyone else is unaware of those challenges, I would say: ‘Read your own decisions and apply them, instead of calling for new ones’.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr President, we successfully set new targets for public development aid on a European Union level. After confirming that the European cooperation effort has to be stepped up to 0.70% of our national wealth by 2015, we set an intermediate goal for the European Union of 0.56% of national wealth by 2010. I take a degree of pride in that decision, because I knew at the beginning of the year that it was a vexed and controversial one. That decision, that advance will increase the level of aid from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to EUR 66 billion by 2010; an increasing contribution, therefore, each year, and, from 2010, an extra EUR 20 billion per annum. It is not perfect, but it is a significant step. Other parts of the world just as wealthy as the Union would do well to take their cue from us to help eradicate poverty, the true scourge of modern times. Having successfully banished slavery in the 19th century, we must be able to eliminate poverty during the first half of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, Mr President, as promised on 12 January when I presented the programme for the Luxembourg Presidency, we have improved our relations with our US partner. This was clear at the meeting on 22 February 2005 here in Brussels with President Bush, who had expressed a desire to come over to Europe. It was also clear during Monday’s summit between President Barroso and President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also mention that on Sunday we had another summit – this time with Canada. We do not devote enough attention to Canada, an important ally for the European Union. Canada is also part of North America.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To come back to Monday’s summit: we confirmed the vital need for both Europe and the USA to stand shoulder to shoulder on the basis of shared convictions. Today, a conference on Iraq is being held in Brussels, as we proposed to President Bush at our meeting on 22 February. The European Union and the United States jointly organising and co-chairing a conference on Iraq: who would have believed, one year or even six months ago, that, on a subject as contentious as Iraq, the European Union and United States of America would one day be able to work together to help establish lasting democracy and freedom in Iraq. I take some pride in having managed to assist Americans and Europeans to develop a common focus and strategy for Iraq. We should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Some applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I see that your applause is particularly lukewarm on this issue. If I had come back to Parliament to report that relations between Europe and the US had deteriorated further, at least half of you would have jumped to your feet claiming that the Presidency should acknowledge its grave failure on a key aspect of foreign relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Mr President, we reached agreement with neighbouring Russia on what is commonly called the ‘four spaces’. Our relations with Russia, which have been so important since the 10 May summit, have warmed considerably. This is a source of satisfaction, although we have to acknowledge that differences of opinion still remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in December 2004, under the Dutch Presidency – something we should perhaps not forget – the future Luxembourg Presidency was instructed to reach political agreement on the financial perspectives by the end of June 2005. On 12 January 2005, only three weeks later, I was standing before you in Strasbourg assessing the chances of reaching an agreement. At the time I said – and I hope you will allow me to quote; you know I love to quote myself:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘We shall do all we can to reach an agreement, but I am not under any illusions. The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time’. I was right, and I added – to quote myself again: ‘The absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency’s failure…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... it will be Europe’s failure’. Here I was not right – or rather I was not entirely right. There are those who accuse the Presidency of being responsible for the failure because it sought to achieve the mandate set, both by the previous Presidency and by all Member States, in its entirety. Others claim that the disagreement is not a failure for Europe because agreements on the financial perspectives are always achieved at the eleventh hour. My view is that it <span class="italic">is</span> a failure for both Europe and for the Presidency, because the disagreement on the financial perspectives, which would have been a minor hiccup under normal circumstances, coming as it did amid the uncertainty stirred up by the French and Dutch referenda, plunged us into a profound crisis. It is clear that those responsible for it will tell you there is no crisis. However, my view is that the crisis is a profound one, because it is not purely financial or budgetary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us get things in the right order. Firstly, between the position of those Member States who wished to restrict the European budget to 1%, and the Commission’s more generous initial position, the Presidency proposed, for the period 2007-2013, a budget for commitment appropriations totalling 1.056% of national wealth, and a budget for payment appropriations equal to 1% of national wealth. I have the impression that this level is now generally accepted by all Member States. That is now a given, and you will see that any future compromise will only differ fractionally from that level of expenditure. If all that happens in the future is that we advance by that fraction, I would have preferred us to have reached a decision last week.</p>
<p class="contents">All my colleagues in the European Council came to Luxembourg between 30 May and 12 June, from 8.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m. I spent 50 hours negotiating the financial perspectives with them. If you then add the 15 hours of debates, negotiation and consultation in the European Council itself, you will see that a total of 65 hours was spent in consultation, debate and negotiations. Quite honestly, we could not have done more, and, quite honestly, those coming after us will do less.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">During those 50 hours of debate, which I must say were amicable and bilateral, I listened to my colleagues carefully. No one, and I mean no one, demanded that the British rebate be kept as it is – no one. In its last proposal for a final compromise, the Luxembourg Presidency upheld the principle of the British rebate: our last proposal was not that it should be frozen. The overall economics of the compromise were as follows: the rebate would have continued as before with regard to the 15 previous Member States – exactly and precisely as before – but the United Kingdom would have cofinanced the cohesion policy, as normal, solely in the new Member States, while not contributing to the common agricultural policy for those same Member States. This adjustment would have been the equivalent of an annual rebate of EUR 5.5 billion, a higher level than that for the whole of the period 1984-2005. Initially, the Presidency had proposed freezing the British rebate at EUR 4.7 billion, which would have enabled us to adjust the net contribution of the Netherlands by around EUR 1 billion, and to lighten the burdens of Germany and Sweden, in particular, which were felt to be excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you are always demanding transparency, I shall give you transparency. The Netherlands – its Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance Minister – knew that the Presidency was intending to lighten their country’s burden by EUR 1 billion per annum. We were unable to do so because the United Kingdom was not prepared to adjust its rebate sufficiently to give us the budgetary headroom needed to cut the Netherlands’ contribution by EUR 1 billion and alleviate the burden on Sweden and Germany. If the Netherlands had been granted that EUR 1 billion, Germany would have been forced to pay it to the Dutch, because the United Kingdom had not cut its rebate sufficiently. I wanted you to know this; I did not ask Germany to pay it because Germany, compared to its initial proposal, had already made a huge step towards the position of the other Member States. So, if the Presidency’s original proposal had been accepted, the problem of the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden would have been solved easily. The Presidency’s final proposal, for a level of EUR 5.5 billion, would not have enabled all of that to be achieved, but at least it would have enabled the UK to cofinance cohesion policies in the new Member States, as normal, with the exception of the common agricultural policy, on which, as we know, the UK has its own particular opinions. It is both as simple and as complicated as that. If only the Six who, in a moment of inspiration, wrote a joint letter, could have agreed on the details of their proposals!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Presidency proposed a declaration of the European Council in which it would have stated, and I quote, that: ‘more appropriate consideration should be given to the way in which the European budget can meet the Union's future challenges and the priorities of our citizens. This general reflection should lead to a reform of all aspects of the budget’. ‘All aspects of the budget’ also include the common agricultural policy. Trying to get us to say that this reflection should cover the common agricultural policy exclusively was a proposal we knew perfectly well would be unacceptable and thrown out by other Member States. However, if all sectors, categories and branches concerned had been brought within the scope of our critical budgetary review, this would have enabled the Commission to obtain a positive decision. We asked the Commission to report on all these aspects, and the Commission agreed to do so, because its President accompanied me throughout every one of the bilateral discussions during the European Council meetings. Incidentally, it is normal for the Commission President to attend this type of consultation. We therefore proposed that, on the basis of the Commission’s report, the European Council should take the appropriate decisions, also, to quote from the text I had proposed: ‘including possible adjustments to the financial perspectives for the period 2007–2013’.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the decision proposed by the Presidency: the British rebate to be maintained for the 15; the British contribution to help finance cohesion policies in the new Member States, but with the common agricultural policy in those States excluded; a Commission proposal by the end of 2008 on a restructuring of the budget; the proposal to be examined by the Council with possible changes to the financial perspectives for the later years, namely from 2009 onwards. I wanted to tell you this because no one has yet provided this explanation and you are likely to be hearing a different one soon.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is not true that the Presidency was seeking to kill off the British rebate. We sought to maintain it for the 15-nation Europe, but to increase the impact in terms of solidarity for the new Member States. That was the package that was rejected. It was a mistake to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">The package was rejected although we had introduced a further EUR 6 billion of extra CAP expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania within the envelope of the decision made in October 2002. Although the letter from the Six could give the impression that they had all concurred that the October 2002 agreement should not be touched, I took this risk upon myself for the 15 – a risk moreover widely shared by the others who were happy to have found someone to take a soundly-based initiative on behalf of the 15. Whereas, in 2006, EUR 42 billion will be spent on direct aid and market measures, the Presidency’s proposal would have meant, for the 15-State Europe, a cut in that figure to EUR 35 billion in 2013. The Presidency's proposal would have involved a cut from EUR 42 billion of direct aid and market measures to EUR 35 billion in 2013, which, for the 15-nation Europe, would have meant a reduction of close to 17% for the common agricultural policy alone. And even in the Europe of 27 members, in other words including our Romanian and Bulgarian friends, the CAP would have been reduced by over 5% in the period in question. To say that nothing was done to lighten the burden of the common agricultural policy is simply untrue. We did everything possible to achieve it. In October 1985, when I presented my first budget to Parliament here – the one for 1986 – agriculture accounted for 68% of the European budget. I proposed that it should not exceed 37%, or EUR 35 billion, in 2013. What a long way we have come! What obstinacy in being unable to see it!</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Presidency’s proposal, the CAP would have been the only sector where expenditure fell considerably, while, for instance, all forward-looking investment would have increased. A rise of 7.5% in expenditure on the Lisbon goals: 7.5% per annum for the whole period 2007–2013, representing an increase of 65% in appropriations for the Lisbon goals as compared to 2006. An increase of 15% for policies in the field of justice and home affairs, including, in particular, increasing the effectiveness of action to combat cross-border crime. Finally, a 2% increase in cohesion policies for the 27 countries, with a greater concentration on the new Member States. We had introduced some changes to the criteria for distribution between the old and new Member States in terms of the cohesion policies, increasing to 53% the total appropriation to the new Member States, compared to 47% in the Commission’s proposal. To argue that the bulk of the effort, in our proposal, would have fallen on the shoulders of the old Member States is simply not true.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come, Mr President, to a comparison of the research budget with that of the common agricultural policy, and vice versa. We cannot compare apples and pears. Why try to compare when a comparison is impossible? The common agricultural policy is the sole true Community policy financed exclusively from the European budget. Research is, first and foremost, a national policy, supported by the Community budget. The two cannot be compared. Based on the Presidency’s proposal, the CAP would have cost EUR 305 billion for the whole of the period in question. The public research policies of the Member States and of the European Union, if the national policies had remained at today’s levels, would have represented EUR 524.5 billion for the period 2007–2013, far more than the common agricultural policy. If the European Union had proved able to make an effort as proposed by the Presidency, and the Member States had complied with their undertakings in relation to a reformulation of the Lisbon strategy, they would have increased the public share of research budgets from 1.9% to 3% of GDP. National and EU research policies should have reached a total of EUR 785 billion by 2013. If all decisions had been respected and if the Presidency’s proposals had been accepted, research budgets would have been EUR 785 billion – I am referring to the public share of research budgets – compared to EUR 305 billion for the CAP. So let us hear no more nonsense talked about this affair. Spending on the common agricultural policy would have been adjusted downwards and, on a comparison with something genuinely comparable, would be well below half the figure for research spending. So, let us stop comparing things which are not comparable.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is a brief summary of the facts. Today we have a disagreement. We shall have to find an agreement enabling us to introduce the new policies on good terms in the new Member States from 2007 onwards. We have no right to let down the new Member States which, in all my bilateral discussions with them and in the final and general discussion, behaved with remarkable dignity. We now have to move ahead and find a better formula, if there is one, but this must be done without destroying the mechanisms for cohesion, without watering down common policies, and without damaging the cohesion policies. This is essential – absolutely imperative. Apart from that, Luxembourg, to which I look forward to returning in the near future to devote myself exclusively to its many and, in the short term, very weighty issues, is ready to contribute wholeheartedly to a search for that solution, without bitterness or a spirit of revenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the last item on the agenda of the European Council was the process of ratifying the Constitution. I shall deal with this aspect more succinctly because, here, the decisions of the European Council have been reported more objectively by the participants and observers. It is a fact that ten countries have ratified the Constitutional Treaty, while two others, France and the Netherlands, have rejected it. Our view – not because we are pig-headed, stubborn or short-sighted – was that the Constitutional Treaty was not the main issue, but rather that the Constitutional Treaty was the response to many of the problems of Europe’s citizens with the European Union. Consequently, we opted to persevere with the ratification process. Some Member States, no doubt feeling the need for a period of reflection, explanation and discussion, and therefore of democracy, before going to the people either in parliament or in a referendum, decided, in the wake of that decision, to defer their scheduled referenda or parliamentary ratification. In those countries, the debate will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I should like this appeal, which was the appeal of the European Council, to be heard and for there to be a longer period of reflection, explanation, debate and, if necessary, disagreement throughout Europe – in the Member States who have still to ratify, in those which have already ratified and in the two which rejected the Constitutional Treaty. It is vital that the European debate, enriched and nourished by the ideas of everyone involved, should take place in all Member States of the European Union. We need to debate Europe, and I want the institutions of the Union, the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States, civil society, unions, political parties and national parliaments all to join in that vast debate. I also want the Commission to take its rightful place in the debate – a discussion which will be both 27-times national and European. I want the Commission, the guardian not only of the Treaty but above all of the spirit of the Treaty, and of the European ambition, to be at the very centre of the discussions. This is not to give the impression that everything is inspired, managed and predetermined in Brussels, but is aimed to ensure that this 27-times national, and therefore European, debate can be guided by wisdom and ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I invite, recommend and urge you to involve both yourself in person and the Commission in that debate; I know you are eager to do it; you must do it, it is urgent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are told, and I have said so myself, that during the budget debate we have seen a stand-off between two concepts of Europe: one based rather more on market forces, a market unable to produce solidarity, and another based, not rather more but completely, on a more highly-developed political integration. The free trade area on one side and political union on the other. This is the debate we are about to have, and we are already seeing Europe divided into two opposing camps. There are those who believe that Europe as it stands has already gone too far, and those, like me, who think it has still not gone far enough. This explanatory debate must be used to reconcile these two segments of public opinion which, today, do not talk to one another, staring at one another like statues, unable even to engage in dialogue. We, the European institutions, must build a bridge between these two camps of our public opinion. But I was considerably reassured to read that those who had thought, after the latest European Council, that there had been a clash, a conflict between two visions of Europe, were making a big mistake. That no one really wanted Europe to become a free trade area; that reassured me considerably.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you know, free trade areas cannot be established overnight. The less we invest in political union, the more we – unknowingly, unconsciously and imperceptibly – pave the way, with an implacable logic, for the concept of a free trade area. When this concept has been achieved, it will appear to have been an altogether natural development and one which rules out any possibility of going back – and supporters of the free trade area would view it as a backward step – to political union. There are those who say they have no intention of leading Europe towards a free trade area, an excessively simplistic concept for an ultra-complicated continent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite simple: those who thought they were highlighting the dangers of a free trade area were wrong. Those who say they were wrong will use the next few months and years to show that they, too, want nothing but political union as described in the Constitution. It is as simple as that, a matter of saying yes or no to the question I have just asked.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this Presidency, Mr President, I wanted to remind you, this time without quoting myself, that at the outset I had insisted on the need to respect institutional rules, to respect what is often referred to as the institutional triangle, which I still consider to offer a number of benefits. We have done so systematically during this Presidency. Between the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission there has been an exchange of views, an ongoing and virtuous debate. Nothing done by the Presidency has been done without the Commission's prior knowledge. No initiative has been taken by the Commission without the Presidency being notified in advance. The Presidency consulted the Commission on the initiatives it was taking, and vice versa. It was a great pleasure to work with this Commission, and especially with its President, and I should like to thank the Commission and its President for the large amount of good advice it gave to the Luxembourg Presidency. Thank you Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards Parliament, we worked together like twins. We often disagreed, either because your proposals were not sensible, or because the sensible proposals of the Presidency were not accepted by all Member States and therefore could not obtain your agreement, an agreement which, however, was spontaneously forthcoming whenever the Presidency referred its initiatives to you prior to submitting them to the other Member States. Today, the European Parliament has reached maturity. I am not saying this paternalistically or with condescension, but I can gauge it by the depth of explanations, the intensity and quality of today’s debates compared to those I have heard since 1982. It is a great Parliament, which has no reason to keep a low profile, which has its legitimacy and which carries the hopes of the people of Europe. Very often in its plenary sessions not enough Members are present – not the case today, I am very pleased to say.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps this is an area where more work is needed. I talk to Parliament and, when I leave Parliament, I talk to groups of visitors.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those coming to Parliament do not come just to look at the debating Chamber; they want to see it full. So, there is room for improvement here. Apart from that, we know why it is that Members cannot always be present in the Chamber. I must say that it is a great pleasure to work with Parliament, both in public sessions and, above all, in committees. What depth of knowledge, what commitment to the European cause is displayed in meetings of the parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees, and in the numerous discussions with individual Members! I shall be very sorry not to be able to come to the European Parliament so regularly in future to participate in this great European debate, both here in this Chamber and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, early on 18 June on the morning after the European Council, I bitterly regretted having failed to avoid Europe plunging, not irrevocably but undeniably, into a crisis. I regretted it and it showed. I have read that I was not very diplomatic, but I have no desire to be diplomatic when Europe is in crisis, none whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nor did I want to be an actor, merely playing a role. I am not an actor, I want to work for the interests of Europe and its citizens. I have no time for acting. Because we never say what we think, because we always play a role, because we always try to be diplomatic so as not to give offence, people do not understand, people believe we are machines. We are not machines; we are human beings experiencing disappointment and despondency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed because I had believed that Europe could be considered to have come of age, to have matured. I had to admit that it is still in its adolescence. Having believed it to be adult, I now see that we are still in the last stages of a long period of adolescence. That is why I am disappointed. However, I also had reasons to be pleased. Pleased, for instance, to have been able to do what we did – together for most of the time – and to have brought at least 20 countries to an agreement on the financial perspectives. 20 out of 25 countries is no mean achievement. And I was happy and proud to hear, listen to and observe the new Member States giving us a lesson in European ambitions at the end of the European Council meeting. What a disgrace for those who were not able to do as much!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I felt my convictions being shaken in the early hours of 18 June, and did not have the strength, or the greatness, to launch another appeal on the same day. Not everyone can be De Gaulle. I am surprised at my own modesty.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I had felt my convictions undermined for a moment, but after a few days had passed, after receiving thousands of letters from the length and breadth of Europe, after receiving encouragement from the Commission, Parliament and many observers who are also protagonists, I now feel, now that the first disappointment has passed, more determined than ever. Our generation does not have the right to undo the achievements of prior generations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the right to demolish the work of our predecessors, because future generations will need a political Europe. If it is not political, it will lose its way. They need and want a Europe of solidarity, a social Europe, a competitive Europe, a Europe which is strong at home and strong in the world. So, members of old Europe, committed Europeans, back to work! With enthusiasm!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time, one of my teachers advised me always to be pessimistic because, that way, all my life, I would either be right or pleasantly surprised. To judge from the reactions and events of the past few days, pessimism would seem to be fully justified, but I must tell you that I do not believe in pessimism. I think I can say that, now more than ever, we need to show our determination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are problems in Europe, and it is true that they are serious problems, but we must confront them and be able to find a solution. During the Luxembourg Presidency, we have witnessed the implementation of grand initiatives and innovations which will guide the activities of the European Union over the years to come. Let me start by going back, from the Commission’s viewpoint, over these last six months, a period that has been marked by the experience and the European conviction of my friend Mr Juncker.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we succeeded in adopting our strategic objectives for the EU over the coming five years. It was the first time that they were approved jointly with the Council and Parliament. Today, those same broad guiding principles in terms of prosperity, solidarity and security provide us with a framework, a framework shared by all the institutions of the European Union. We therefore have the opportunity for our actions to be much more effective and focused, and to be able to translate our actions into a true partnership for renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also thanks to the Luxembourg Presidency that we have negotiated an agreement on how to base the Stability and Growth Pact on a more realistic and practical foundation. This reform has neither weakened nor relaxed the pact. It has even given governments greater flexibility, via the financial instruments, to optimise growth over the economic cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the greatest success of the Luxembourg Presidency, from the point of view of the Commission’s priorities, may have been the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy during the Spring European Council. This was a step forward, not only for the institutions and governments, but also for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth remembering that, however important the interinstitutional debate is, the majority of Europeans, when they get together as a family, at school, at work or at leisure, do not discuss the possible configurations of the blocking minority in the system of qualified majority voting. What actually concerns our fellow citizens is the slowdown in the economy. Above all, they are anxious about their jobs or the difficulty of finding work. That is why we have relaunched the Lisbon Strategy: growth and employment. That is why we think that we must, all of us, the European institutions, increase our efforts in areas that directly affect the lives of our citizens. That is the route to take to reforge the links between Europe and its citizens and to respond to the concerns of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, there have been other successes during the Luxembourg Presidency, particularly in our external relations. President Juncker has already mentioned this: the summit with Russia, those with Canada and the United States, the better relationship we now have with our great partner on the other side of the Atlantic, all of that can be credited to the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last European Council, we primarily discussed two questions: what should we do during this period following the referenda in the Netherlands and France and what should we do with regard to the financial perspectives? First of all, the debate on the future of Europe. The European Council’s decision seems to me to be a wise one. The European leaders decided to have a period of reflection and have opened the door to debate, dialogue and democracy. You doubtless remember that the Commission said, just on the eve of the European Council, that it, for its part, wanted to launch this debate by going, if necessary, and this is what we are going to do, to all the Member States of the EU to debate and to listen, not only to the governments, which is certainly important, but also to the parliaments, the social partners and young people in these countries. We are very proud that the European Council has given us a mandate to have a special role in this enterprise, in this debate that must be organised in each Member State, but that must also be held at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to do that, and we hope that, at the end of this exercise, we will be able to present to all Europeans our strategic vision for Europe. What will Europe be like in the coming years, in the six or fifteen years to come? We must launch this debate without being afraid of any of the subjects, even those that are more difficult and more complex for the institutions. We must discuss not only expenditure but also our aims. We must talk about the European social model. How can we work on it in the 21st century? How can we modernise this European social model? How can we reach an equilibrium with regard to Community legislation? How can we avoid bureaucracy at European level? How can we deal with further enlargement, such that Europeans can support it and understand the importance of having a united Europe? We are sure that the European Parliament will have a contribution, a very important contribution, to make to this debate and we, the European Commission, want to work with you because we think it is necessary to build a new consensus in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the other main subject of last week’s summit. It was very disappointing that we were unable to reach a conclusion on the financial perspective. The presidency worked tirelessly for a breakthrough and I have to say that we were near an agreement. Unfortunately, discussions on the budget have seldom brought out the best in the Member States and, sadly, last week it was no different.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some fundamentally different views and some clear national interests, but this in itself is not so unusual. What makes the situation especially delicate is that this ‘no solution’ for the financial perspective comes after two ‘noes’ in two national referenda. I regret that, during the European Council, no leaders were able to show a true spirit of compromise and solidarity on that very important occasion. But it would be wrong to give the impression that we have gone nowhere as a result of last week.</p>
<p class="contents">The committed work of the Luxembourg presidency over the last six months has brought us a long way. This is important because there is a real urgency to get an agreement. If we do not reach agreement, then there is a risk of paralysis which will have a very negative effect on our policies and on all the Member States, particularly the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline the very constructive approach taken by the new Member States. Sometimes people ask me whether it is not more difficult to be in the Commission now with 25 – and very soon to be 27 – Member States. Is it not a much more complex and difficult European Union? I say it is, but let us be frank. The problems we now have in Europe are not the result of the demands of the new Member States; they are not the cause of the problems we have in Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When we consider the work of the Luxembourg presidency we have to say that we cannot go backwards. We must build on the outgoing presidency’s achievements in order to get an agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The incoming presidency has made it clear that it also intends to take these dossiers forward and we now wait with interest for the UK presidency to relaunch the process. The Commission is ready to work with this presidency and all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">More work is needed. I made it clear last week that I have real problems with the downgrading of some of the policies that the Commission and Parliament have emphasised. This is particularly true of those policies aimed at renewed economic dynamism. Genuine reform comes at a price. Reducing the Commission’s proposed spending in areas such as research, innovation, education or transport and energy networks will have a real policy cost. Our citizens are unlikely to be forgiving if we fail to deliver on our promise regarding growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us be frank. The problem, when the Council reduced the ambition of proposal by the Commission and Parliament, and when the Council decided to follow the ‘one per cent club’, was that the areas that were particularly sacrificed were precisely those of competitiveness, growth, education, innovation and research. Cohesion was more or less kept. The common agricultural policy was, of course, maintained in accordance with the agreement made three years ago, but there were major cuts in the areas of competitiveness, growth, innovation and research.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows the price of that famous letter from six of the Member States asking for one per cent. It is a pity that the Member States that agreed on one per cent expenditure – the ones agreeing on that – cannot now agree in the European Council. In fact, they were divided on the issue. It shows what happens all too often today in Europe. It is easier to get a coalition for a ‘no’ vote than to get a coalition for a ‘yes’, when what we need in Europe now are coalitions for ‘yes’ and not more coalitions for ‘no’. These important coalitions are needed for the project for Europe to go forward.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will go on with its work and will pursue the goal of reaching a balanced agreement with the Member States. This must involve Parliament. We want to be sure that when the European Council is ready to reach an agreement it can be swiftly followed by the signing of an interinstitutional agreement between all parties: Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The negotiations will only be over at that moment. I count on Parliament’s support in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to underestimate the degree of difficulty nor the disagreements on priorities, but this necessary debate should not delay an agreement. This is why, even before the European Council, the Commission proposed a review clause. I was very happy to work with President-in-Office Juncker and, as he said earlier, we were discussing a review clause with the Member States. This means that, as we do not know exactly what the world will be like in 2013, we should not have an overall debate before we approve the financial perspective. On the contrary, we should approve the financial perspective as soon as possible and then arrange a meeting later in order to adapt our budget to changing priorities and the international environment. This is wisdom itself. What we cannot use now is an overall debate on priorities as a reason or pretext for not reaching an agreement on the financial perspective. However, at the same time, it is true that we should engage in a serious debate about the reform of the Community budget. We must look forward. It is also true that we should have a meeting at a later stage in order to address all those important questions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we should keep to the deadline for the next phase of the negotiations. If we do not do this, we could fail, and it is my duty to draw the attention of this Parliament to a risk of paralysis in the European Union. We must avoid that risk. Even during this very difficult situation, we are continuing to take decisions. As President-in-Office Juncker said, after the European Council we were taking decisions with our partners in the United States and Canada. Yesterday I was in Italy for the inauguration of the European Food Safety Authority. Today the Commission took important decisions on a Green Paper on energy efficiency and a new regime for the sugar markets. We are continuing to make decisions. I promise you that the Commission does not feel any kind of inhibitions about taking the decisions or initiatives that Europe deserves. However, it is important now to engage the Council, all partners and all institutions and to move in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you not to overlook the other achievements of the European Council. We have seen the endorsement of the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment and an action plan to implement The Hague Programme for freedom, security and justice. These two results address our key objectives of prosperity and security and the mainstream concerns of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also approved guiding principles for sustainable development. This should ensure continuing improvements to the quality of life, not only for current generations but also for future ones. There was also the very important decision to confirm at the highest level – at a European Union summit – the decisions taken by the development ministers following a Commission proposal about our commitment to overseeing development aid and our commitment to Africa. This was a very important step taken by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">What follows now? Is the glass half empty or half full? As I said before, the problem is serious but we can turn it into an opportunity. Sooner or later this clarification had to come and, let us face it, we now have that opportunity. We are closer to agreement on the financial perspective than many people realise. We should also remember that never in the history of the European Union have financial packages been approved during the first round of negotiations. Therefore, I call on all the parties concerned to reflect on the consequences of deadlock and to show some flexibility. I call on all the parties to show less nationalistic rhetoric and to engage in a truly European solution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that both the Luxembourg presidency in general and the European Council in particular have achieved much of which we can be proud. It is true that there is still much to do. Together with the Members of this House, the Commission will work for a future that confirms Europe’s capacity to do business, even if the times do not call for business as usual. We will then be able to prove that the pessimists and the cynics are not always right and that there are reasons to have confidence in the future. </p>
<p class="contents"> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> I would like to finish with a few words for my friend Mr Juncker. Not only for Mr Juncker, but also for the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the Minister for European Affairs, for the diplomats and for the experts. I have been really moved to see the conviction, the determination and the enthusiasm of everybody in this extraordinary team.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to thank you, Jean-Claude, and all your colleagues, for what you have done for Europe. I sincerely hope that I will be able to say the same thing to the next President of the European Council. I will say the same thing if I think it, but I will not say it if I do not think it. Presidencies come and go, but the Commission remains. The Commission defends the general interests of Europe and I would say to you that the Commission, with the support of this Parliament, I hope, will continue to give its full sincere support to the various Presidencies. For its part, the Commission expects the various Presidencies to have the same vocation, the same determination and the same enthusiasm for our European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">The fact that the President of this House referred a short time ago to the Soviet occupation, 65 years ago, of the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – is itself a sign of hope. Who, 20 years ago, would have thought that there would be Members in this House hailing from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? It is because that is such a tremendous thing that we must, even now, believe in our continent’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">Any attempt at analysis must start from the situation as it now stands, and to those who say, ‘we are in a state of political crisis’, I say, ‘I agree with you’. We must, though, make it our concern that this political crisis should not disorient us and seduce us into activity for activity’s sake, and so we must respond with determination and deliberation. We believe in this Europe of ours, and, for that reason, the political will must be there to lead this Europe of ours, this European Union, into a bright future.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves, though, in a twofold crisis of confidence; one that involves various protagonists in the European Council and has been building up for several years, and a crisis as regards many people’s confidence in the European Union’s policymakers. Many people feel that a lot of things are going too fast, and we must regard the regaining of their trust as a common endeavour. What is our goal? We want a European Union that is strong, effective and democratic, and all those who want to make it no more than a free trade zone within Europe will have a fight on their hands. Our Group wants no part of any such thing; we want a strong, effective and democratic European Union, one that enables us to defend our interests in the world. We say the same thing to those who believe that what we need today is the rebuilding of axes; we have heard of one proposal for a Franco-German Union, while others are dreaming of a change of government ushering in an axis between the United Kingdom and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who think like this I have this to say: on the contrary, while we need good bilateral relationships, they must be offered to the European Union as a whole, and it is on this basis of goodwill that we, in the European Union, must then function as a community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth my adding that the Treaty of Nice makes provision for enhanced cooperation. If some countries want to go further, we can do just that in many areas – foreign and security policy among them.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Constitutional Treaty is concerned, we must be self-critical. The referendum in Luxembourg is now, no doubt, going to go ahead on 10 July, and I wish the President-in-Office every success in it. We now have a pause for thought, and we must use it in order to think. Rather than having a respite from thinking, we must use the time we now have in order to think and to ensure that, when this process of reflection is over, Parts 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Treaty can become legal and political realities.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the European Union’s budget, we find the failure to achieve a result regrettable, but we – including Reimer Böge, who is present in the Chamber – can take some pride in the fact that this House has succeeded in putting together a proposal, and we call on the Heads of State or Government to take it as their guide and to seek to make the reforms that are needed. This House has already given its answer.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This Financial Perspective is needed – and I say this with the utmost seriousness – for those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and that must be able to rely on our common solidarity in planning how they are to develop their weakest regions. It is for that reason that I hope we will be able to complete this Financial Perspective, which we owe to the European Union’s new Member States, under the incoming British presidency. We in the PPE-DE Group will play our part in making this possible, and we will do so in a spirit of solidarity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, totting up the debits and credits of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council has been an emotional business. We have heard a speech that was extraordinary not only by reason of the character of the man delivering it, but also by reason of its extraordinary frankness.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been a Member of this House for 11 years. In all that time, I have never come across such frankness in a presentation on a European Council by its Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">For this frankness I am grateful, for it gives this House greater knowledge and hence affords it the opportunity to better analyse what transpired last weekend. A lot happened, and let me repeat at the very outset what you, Mr President-in-Office, said: it was a defeat for Europe. You were right there. You went on to say that it also represented a defeat for the Presidency, but that is where you are wrong. Anyone who saw you over the weekend – and we all did – saw something that was not a defeat for the Council Presidency. It may well, today, be too early to judge, but I am quite certain that those who come after us will rank Jean-Claude Juncker among the truly great Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For that we are grateful to you. After 60 hours of negotiations, followed by a 15-minute visit from one who had participated in them, we can understand some of the bitterness that came out in your speech, for it is a fact that what emerges from this summit is that the time really has come for the European Union to spell out the facts. Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, but then so are its Heads of State or Government. The fact is that, for years, the people who hold the reins of power in Europe – in other words, the European Council, the Heads of State or Government – have invariably taken the same approach. Victory was theirs; it was the Brussels bureaucrats who lost.</p>
<p class="contents">It became clear from last weekend’s summit that we can now put a name to what has caused Europe to lose out: the particularism of those Heads of State or Government who believe that the interests of all are served when each thinks only of himself.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Parliaments exist to give expression to what the public feels, and you are right to say that high diplomacy belongs somewhere else; this is where the truth has to be told.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr Juncker, I want to give you every credit for telling it like it is and for calling things by their proper names. We have lessons to learn from that, and one important one is that we should start by noting that, of the three institutions, two have done their homework; the Commission produced its proposal for the Financial Perspective, and Parliament decided on its position, while the Council has shown itself incapable of coming to an agreement on it. Let me point out that two of the institutions that participate in the trialogue have done what they had to do. The Council has not, and we will wait.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable that everyone sitting around the table should be saying ‘I’m right’. Then the next person to be called upon to speak says, ‘I’m right, too’. The third person to speak also says, ‘That may well be so, but I’m right’.</p>
<p class="contents">How such people can reach a result that is of any use to Europe escapes me. Above all else, I simply do not see how a head of government, of whatever country, can say, ‘I have quite specific goals’, and then, by his own actions, help to wreck the instruments that are needed in order to achieve those goals. I simply do not get it, and I do not see this as something that this House can take lying down.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is the Financial Perspective about? It is about everyone making a move. We do, of course know that our continent’s ability to survive depends on our promotion of innovation, research and technology, and that these things are crucial to the Lisbon process. We also know, of course, that we need money in order to do these things, and that it follows that money has to be reassigned. Yet, if everyone knows that, why do we not get the right results?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you what I think, what my very personal opinion is: it is that the reason lies in the fact that, this weekend, European policy was, yet again, not the deciding factor. Things were of course said about Europe’s future, but most of the speeches made there were devoted to internal policy. We all know that there is a great island state in this Union, where internal party constraints limit room for manoeuvre. We all know too that there is a great continental state in this Union in which the results of elections hang upon agriculture. There may be many more internal policy considerations than these two, the effects of which on European policy we Europeans have to live with, so let us, in this House, unite in saying that we are no longer prepared to do so, for this is proving to be Europe’s ruin!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The President deserves praise for having, today, delivered himself of a fine affirmation of his role in Europe. You, Mr Barroso, are indeed the guardian of the European Treaties. Nobody will be able to make the Treaty of Nice serve as the basis for a free trade zone; it may be inadequate, but it has taken the process of integration far too far for that to be possible, and if you want to defend the deepening of Europe, this House will always be right alongside you. What the people of Europe are now waiting for, though, is signals from Europe; we do indeed need the market, we do indeed need internal and external competition, but those in the Netherlands and in France who voted ‘no’ did so not least because they feared that this market, this competition, would wreck their social security, destroying what has been built up over decades. In the realm of practical politics, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have produced a five-point plan showing how you can help get the Working Time Directive and the Services Directive adopted as social – rather than as anti-social – legislation. That will give you a chance to show where the Commission stands.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a great speech from a great President. Not only he, but also the Luxembourg team as a whole have – as the President of the Commission rightly said – done a terrific job, and for that, Mr Juncker, I thank you, as well as Mr Schmit and all those who have worked together with us this past six months. Working with the Luxembourg Presidency was – I believe, for all of us – an extraordinarily pleasant business. Differences of opinion are not always so pleasant in this political life. Thank you for your speech, and I believe I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that I look forward to tomorrow with eager anticipation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graham Watson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold">– </span>Thank you, Mr President. President-in-Office, if the Luxembourg presidency has failed your expectations, I hope you will not blame yourself. President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats in this House applaud your attempts to keep the EU show on the road. You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs. Your lack of success was not for lack of effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Your final summit was doomed from the moment France voted to reject the Constitution. The triumphalism of the ‘no’ voters, however, will be short lived. In Greek tragedy, actors often deepen their own plight while believing that their actions will help them to escape it. So is the case with the French <span class="italic">oppositionnistes</span> and the Socialists who were their cheerleaders. Their votes will bring to bear the very changes they most fear.</p>
<p class="contents">At least in Greek tragedy the audience is permitted to understand what is happening. That luxury is available to many of us only with hindsight some time after the referenda. I suspect that you, President-in-Office, through your passionate commitment to the European cause, which I welcome, were unable to stand back and look objectively at the impact on your presidency of the week of 29 May 2005. Had you done so you might have looked upon that week as a defining moment in the history of a European Union that will never be the same again.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence your final summit was characterised not by the pockets of resistance of which you spoke optimistically, but by a fight between two ailing dinosaurs, Britain and France. Unable to admit that national sovereignty is a luxury of the past, they persist in trying to impose their order on others. Britain seeks a British Europe rather than a European Britain. France is just as insular without the excuse of being an island. Both harbour a dangerous illusion, for there can be only one Europe, truly European. That Europe must have the necessary funding to function. The insistence by some Member States on one per cent of GNI would deprive us of the Lisbon investment, as indeed your final proposal might have done. It is perhaps better to have no agreement and to re-think both how we raise money and how we spend it, than to reach agreement at any cost.</p>
<p class="contents">But to those who seek to use these setbacks to re-establish an iron curtain, I would quote Robert Schuman, who said in 1949: ‘I have no intention of drawing a geographical line of demarcation between Europe and non-Europe. There is another way of setting limits: that which distinguishes those who have the European spirit and those who have not.’</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, the Franco-German motor of European integration on which your presidency relied is kaput. We need another motor to replace it. It must be neither British nor French. The Union must recognise that it has moved on from reconciliation and security of food supply to other demands of a rapidly changing world: a world that will not wait for Europe. So do not allow this pause for reflection to be a period of paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Go home and make sure you win your referendum. Then mobilise the other smaller states to prevent the prehistoric predators from destroying what has been built. Take satisfaction from the achievements of your presidency: the agreement on the Euro-vignette for transport infrastructure charging; the action plan for The Hague Programme; the agreement on a European driving licence; and, with luck, even the elusive Members’ Statute to demonstrate the maturity of this House. All of these mark good progress for the Union, and you may well conclude that you are left with more than just an overflowing ashtray. As Aristotle taught us, we may not always achieve our goals, but it is our pursuit of them that changes the course of history.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monica Frassoni, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, in order to make the European Union function, it were enough to have an effective Presidency of the Council and a President-in-Office endowed with a firm belief in Europe and a certain charisma and credibility, we would be home and dry. Mr Juncker, I also say to you that if you genuinely wished to continue your work, you could perhaps have chosen the presidency of another, rather more stable institution, and you might have been able to play a more direct part in a European debate that we, in fact, believe is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Luxembourg and its Prime Minister have steered the Union well during these turbulent months but that has not helped to restore confidence among the French and Dutch electorate, or to revive the European economic machine, or to put positive initiatives in the pipeline, of the sort that people dream about. The European Council has only confirmed the reality of a divided Europe of governments, which is perhaps not even very interested in nursing a genuine ambition in the face of a Europe of uncertain and frightened peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret, Mr Juncker, that the last action of your Presidency has been to put forward a genuinely unacceptable budget proposal, unacceptable because it follows the same failing logic of an unsustainable reduction of the Union’s budget. I greatly respect your pragmatism, your realism and understanding of the difficulty and the complicated calculations that you have outlined to us here. It is also true, however, that even your proposal included cutbacks to positive policies – to the development policy, to the rural development policy, and even to the sacred Lisbon policy – that are not acceptable for today’s Europe. We therefore genuinely hope that, once your Presidency has come to an end, your government will throw out such a proposal, partly because we believe that that could help you in your referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it seems that those who only want Europe to be a large supermarket have a definite advantage compared with those who want a political Europe. For now they are the only ones who have been strengthened by the twin ‘no’ vote, and I believe that we will have further confirmation of that tomorrow, when Tony Blair will come to us, spruce and smiling, explaining how to make Europe even more intergovernmental and weak. The only plan in sight for now is clearly the Blair plan.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore believes that the failure to reach an unsatisfactory agreement on the financial perspectives is a positive result and considers it important that the Council has given itself time to reflect on the Constitution, without, however, putting an end to the ratification process for those who wish for it to continue. I can already tell you today, Mr President, that a great many members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support you for the referendum in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, however, that this reflection needs to be given time, method and clear objectives, and that, in terms of the financial perspectives, difficult chapters that already seemed to be closed need to be reopened. It is on those two issues that the conflict between the ‘supermarketeers’ and the unionists will burn itself out. We therefore might as well begin to sharpen our weapons, Mr Juncker, because it is really not worth losing our way in abstruse compromises, even if they have brought 20 ministers together.</p>
<p class="contents">If we genuinely believe that political union remains the aim, and if we are genuinely ashamed of having to accept the initiative of the ten new Member States on the budget, then we need to act immediately and unambiguously. Forget about agreeing on the details! We have to reject the letter of the Six, finally begin to see that the debate on the size of the budget has to be based on the political priorities, and not the other way round, and reopen the debate on everything: the CAP, Life-Nature and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Mr Barroso, we also have to do ‘something European’, in the words of a famous Italian film director, something quite different from the Bolkestein Directive, software patenting, the arbitrary and secretive authorisation of new GMOs, or a bit of hot air on sustainable development, whereas in reality – alas – environmental policy is becoming an increasingly marginal issue in your Commission. Reflection on the future of Europe and its legitimacy will be made much easier if Europe has something to offer in the months to come: REACH, an action on climate change, the tangible redefinition of social Europe, the working time directive, serious attention paid to the Millennium Round commitments. All of this is perfectly feasible and will help us to revive the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Mr President: we have very serious doubts that reflection on the Constitution can be carried forward and guided by the bickering crowd operating at the top, and the European Parliament has to take some of the responsibility for that. Mr Borrell, I will address you in the very few seconds remaining: I would like Parliament not to be just a talk show, but you yourself to sponsor an action to place it at the centre of a European-initiative debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my 26 years of parliamentary experience, this is a first for me. I will return to this in a moment, and tomorrow, but, before that, I would like to dwell for a moment on the last topic brought up by Mr Juncker: the ratification of the draft Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with interest that, three weeks after the success of the ‘no’ vote to the ex-draft Constitutional Treaty, the truth is gradually pushing its way to the fore, both with regard to the demands expressed by these votes and with regard to their scope, which goes far beyond the two countries directly concerned. Thus, a survey commissioned by the Commission itself, following the referendum in France, was analysed in these terms in the Eurobarometer bulletin; I quote: ‘social concerns … [are] … at the heart of the “no” vote’. Among the main reasons cited for voting ‘no’ are that, and I quote: ‘economically speaking the draft is seen as too liberal’ and ‘the lack of social Europe’. The commentary adds, and again I quote, that ‘the rejection of Turkey’s membership of the EU was mentioned spontaneously by only 6% of people who voted “no”’. The electorate’s choice was, as the Eurobarometer document notes, made after careful consideration. We should also add that just 4% of the people surveyed declared themselves to be against Europe. The message is therefore clear: ‘yes’ to Europe, including an enlarged Europe, but ‘no’ to the liberal direction it is taking.</p>
<p class="contents">This sentiment is shared by many other peoples, which doubtless explains the domino effect of the first two ‘no’ votes. Lessons are starting to be drawn from these great manifestations of the citizens’ crisis of conscience with regard to Europe as it is, including by the European Trade Union Confederation, which has just called on the 25 to take into consideration, and I quote, ‘fear of lower social standards and neo-liberal policies’ in order to regain the confidence of European citizens. This is the context in which we need to assess the last European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us summarise. It has decided to continue with the process of ratifying the ex-Constitutional Treaty by, and I quote, ‘altering the timetable according to circumstances’, which is a singularly cavalier attitude to democracy. It has agreed, and again I quote, ‘to reflect together’, to gain some time, as a high-up European official was kind enough to specify. Primarily, the European Council has, moreover, provided European opinion with the grossest caricature of this commercial, egotistical, directionless Europe, which our fellow citizens, as it happens, have quite rightly rejected: we could not have done better in turning our backs on the expectations of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr Juncker, having worked so hard to avoid such a deplorable outcome, found the right words to denounce the main culprit for this fiasco. Beyond that, it is the whole club of six, these countries which have, for months, been consumed by their obsession to freeze budgets at 1% of European revenues, that, in my view, incarnates a narrow concept of Europe, with no relation to our declared ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">What real alternatives are there, not only in budgetary terms, but in terms of the direction of the institutional criteria: that, in the opinion of my group, is the agenda for the great citizens’ debate that we need to have on a European scale, and which I called for during our last part-session by quite particularly addressing the left of the House. Mr Schulz appears to be responding positively to this idea, but in a very institutional context. It seems to me that three of the conditions for the success of such a debate are, first, that it should be free from any pressure; next, that it should be open to actual citizens and not to institutional representatives of civil society; and, finally, that it should result in a new treaty that our fellow citizens can support this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the specific decisions that will be taken at European level during this pause for reflection must also demonstrate, in the eyes of our fellow citizens, our ability to listen to their message and our determination to take it fully into account. However, we will discuss that tomorrow in the presence of our next Presidency, which will clearly be different from the outgoing one. The great debate on the future of Europe is getting off to a good start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You always do things well at a technical level, but today I must criticise you, Mr Juncker, for the summit’s decision to continue the ratification process with a document rejected by the French in a binding referendum. What an insult to your French neighbours and Dutch friends from the Benelux countries! What contempt for the law! The Treaty of Nice is unambiguously clear: it may only be altered by a unanimous vote, and there is no such unanimity now that the Netherlands has said that it will not ratify the Constitution. What a retreat from reality, too! All reflective people know that that document would never survive a referendum in, for example, Great Britain. The Constitution is dead. One should bury the dead, and doing so cannot be deferred or postponed. With all respect, even you cannot breathe life into a corpse by threatening to withdraw as Prime Minister if the Luxembourgers also politely reject a Constitution that, on the basis of population figures and with no proper exercise of democracy, would shift power from the electorate to officials.</p>
<p class="contents">You are wasting time. Let us, rather, start afresh. Let us bring the same number of proponents and opponents of the Constitution together and prepare a joint consultation document for new ground rules. We shall be able to discuss this and elect a new Convention able to represent the electorate’s attitude to Europe’s future. We shall then be able to obtain a practical, brief and easily understandable cooperation agreement able to be adopted in referenda on the same two days in all the EU countries. If we devise an agreement that is better than the Treaty of Nice, most Europeans will naturally vote in favour of it. If the watchwords are transparency, democracy and proximity to the people, we shall also be happy to do so. A new opinion poll shows that 80% of Danes support the proposal to reverse the burden of proof in matters of transparency and that 79% want each country to be able to elect its own Commissioner. There are only, respectively, 11% and 12% of Danes who are opposed to these proposals. That is the type of support we should be seeking by means of a new treaty. We should not be seeking a Constitution to take precedence over Luxembourg’s and other countries’ constitutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It proved to be the case that the enlargement of the European Union and its possible socio-economic threats – immigration, wherever it may come from, economic liberalisation, whoever may have demanded it, played a significant part in forming a negative attitude. That is how the citizens of the European Union perceived it.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference, however, to what has been said and taking into account also other negative attitudes towards the European Union revealed in opinion surveys, undoubtedly the greatest responsibility lies with the politicians of the Member States. Too much is demanded of the European Union and Member States have been prepared to invest too little in order for the European Union to go from success to success. Politicians from the Member States have been eager to nationalise and attribute to themselves too many of the European Union’s true achievements, and to attribute to Europe their own domestic political failures. Too often, when taking difficult domestic political decisions, politicians from the Member States do not forget to justify them by reference to European Union requirements. It seems that we have overspent our credit. There exist two visions of the European Union’s future – one of a political European Union and one of a European Union of high-level economic cooperation. In truth, these two visions are two sides of the same coin – without economic and also social integration it will not be possible to build a sustainable edifice of political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">That, to my mind, is the clearest lesson of the last two referenda. We have to create the socio-economic preconditions for the citizens of the European Union to be able to assess and understand why political integration is necessary, why we, for example, wish to call the European Treaty a Constitution. Can we really consider the Council meeting to be a long-term failure? It approved the Lisbon Strategy, a strategy that means a lot more than integration of the internal market. The Lisbon Strategy is the model for cooperation in the European Union which, when applied to its fullest extent, would help to organise in the European Union the ambitions of our economic and social policy, a direction for Europe to grow as united and competitive, and in the medium term to regain the confidence of society. The Lisbon agenda, which has been a blatant example of the European Union’s indecisiveness in the past five years, must become an example of success and cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That, however, can only be implemented if we can overcome the attitude towards cooperation in the European Union that we have exhibited until now. It is enough to recall the current unproductive debates on the Services Directive, which is a cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy. The concluding words of the agreement on the Lisbon Strategy have demonstrated that the Council has partners who are engaged in the future of the European Union, and who will be able to find a basis for important tasks – security and cooperation, the enlargement of the European Union and cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That statement by the German playwright is more topical than ever when we see the frenetic efforts that are being made – only last week at the failed summit in Brussels – to ignore the vote of the Dutch and the French people. Allow me to quote a small example from my own country to illustrate my point. My party, the <span class="italic">Vlaams Belang</span>, which is the largest party in Flanders, being opposed to the European superstate of which the Constitution is the groundplan, was not even allowed to take part in the radio and television debates that were organised on the subject. The conduct of the media and political elites was much like that of the pigs in George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’; all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone claims that the bookkeepers’ mentality of some egos in European politics blocked an agreement on the multi-annual budget, because it involved some USD 1 000 billion for seven years while, by way of comparison, the annual budget of the US alone amounts to USD 2 500 billion. What matters is not so much whether Europe spends enough money in order to meet tomorrow’s challenges, but that it should do so by using its funds differently. Europe should not get involved in matters that would, in the final analysis, be regulated more effectively at national level. Europe should really start observing the principle of subsidiarity if it wants to count on the public’s understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">When I see in Flanders how Europe’s billions, via the structural funds, end up in the bottomless pits of Wallonian profiteers, I can only sympathise with such people as the Dutch Prime Minister, who was treated with such contempt by our own Foreign Affairs Minister on account of his consistent stance. At the risk of shocking some of you, it follows that I cannot get too excited about the failure of last week’s summit. Contrary to what some are trying to make out, neither the world, nor Europe, will collapse as a result of it.</p>
<p class="contents">One positive thing that came out of the summit was that everyone, including the most die-hard supporters of unrestrained enlargement, is now agreed that a period of reflection is what is called for before we hurtle down the path we have chosen. If the voice of the Dutch and French people calls a halt to the undemocratic process of Turkish accession, in respect of which bureaucracy is flying in the face of what Europeans want, the end of the European Constitution might well spell the beginning of a fresh and different Europe where the will of the people is taken into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know what was decided in Brussels and, moreover, what was not. I now want to convey two messages on behalf of Luxembourg’s Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. The first is a message of appreciation for the outstanding achievements of the Luxembourg Presidency in general and of the President, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, in particular. When individual Heads of State or Government are so arrogant, presumptuous and motivated by pure self-interest as to be prepared to jeopardise the progress of the European project and the success of enlargement, then we cannot expect what comes out of the summit to move Europe any further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not propose to enlarge on what consequences this may have for the future of the European Union, but what I will say is that, if a few European Heads of Government want to put on the sort of performance that we saw last week, then we will not be able to win back the trust of those who, in France and the Netherlands, voted against the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">My second message I bring as one who survived the Second World War, as one who, well advanced in years, is able, in this House, to work for the European cause alongside Members from the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, and as one who can do no other than quote what Mr Juncker said: ‘The last European Council makes me feel ashamed.’ I am ashamed of the evident fact that certain Heads of Government in the western half of our continent have no concept of what the eastward enlargement is all about, nor of the European Union being anything other than a continental bargain-basement. I am ashamed of our inability, over a year after enlargement, to motivate people between Tallinn and Ljubljana and to persuade them that their sacrifices, their achievements and their endurance over the last 15 years were anything other than futile. We should all be ashamed of the way in which certain participants in the summit behaved. If the founding fathers had behaved as they did, there would have been no united Europe, and half a billion Europeans would never have known peace, freedom and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will change and continue to develop, just as it did after the French National Assembly rejected the European Defence Community. For my part, I can do no other than hope that the changes that this continent will undergo and experience over the years to come will show no trace of the pettiness and egoism that caused the last European Council to fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Luxembourg Presidency has indeed presided. It has drafted many constructive proposals, and it has managed to produce honourable compromises on a number of topics. The Lisbon Strategy has been relaunched and the national parliaments have finally become more sensitive to this grand European objective. The Stability and Growth Pact will be more intelligent, as it is adapted to economic cycles. The broad economic policy and employment guidelines have been agreed for three years. The Luxembourg Presidency has been able to move the EU forward regarding subjects as varied as increased commitment to the Millennium Goals, more targeted support for rural development and notable advances with regard to police cooperation and to security at external borders, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The very positive record of the Presidency has been overshadowed by the festival of national egos celebrated at the end of the week by one Head of State and certain Heads of Government. I have had the opportunity to say in this forum that the EU is currently sadly lacking in statesmen. It is governed by political gnomes busy jealously guarding their small treasure. Very few leaders have a true political vision of the future of Europe. Mr Juncker is not one of them. He is both an architect and a plumber. Politics has sometimes led me to oppose my Prime Minister, but I sympathised with him when he declared his shame faced with the mean-minded arrogance of some of his counterparts in the rich countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Europe suffers from internal contradictions. There are those who push for greater political integration and those who simply want one huge market. Europe is in crisis. Etymologically, the Greek word <span class="italic">krisis</span> means ‘decision’. The time for a decision has come; we have to choose: more Europe, or the opt-out. The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to move Europe forward, and it deserves well of Europe. In six months, we will assess the new Presidency, but Mr Blair will have to present us with something other than a pseudo-modernist discourse on the need for structural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the world is changing. Europe has to adapt. Any community that does not have close links to employment, salaries and productivity becomes unfair, however, and, at the end of the day, becomes poorer. I have just quoted Carlos Fuentes. The economy must continue to serve social well-being, and solidarity must be the keyword of European politics. Europe will either be social or will not be at all, Madam President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Juncker for his sincere efforts and the European passion that he has demonstrated. The applause of this House has shown that, among the cries of the Eurosceptics and the silence of the extreme pro-Europeans, we have encountered in you political intelligence and the vision of the greatest pro-Europeans. We would also like it if the other leaders of the Community institutions demonstrated the same courage and leadership in future. Let us remember, however, that a defeat is only a defeat when we accept it, and we must not accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a difficult crisis, the most difficult for many years: first of all the referendum, and today the failed agreement. A Pandora’s box has been opened, exposing different visions of Europe. I should like to point out to all those debating the costs of Europe that, if we do not resolve the crisis soon, as the Cecchin report said almost 20 years ago, we will be talking about the costs of non-Europe, and the costs of non-Europe are higher than the costs of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The contradiction between the tasks that we would like to give to Europe – in terms of global order, the economy and research – and the negotiations on the budget that Mr Juncker has outlined to us is therefore unsustainable. There will no longer be development or a social model if the Euro group does not address the issue of common economic policy alongside that of monetary policy. There will no longer be a Europe in the global disorder, if this Parliament and the countries ready to do so do not open a debate on enhanced cooperation on foreign policy and common security.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis will not be short-lived. The electoral calendar in Germany, in France and also in Italy, without mentioning others, does not help us. Time for reflection, however, ladies and gentlemen, cannot, and must not, become a Mexican siesta. I am addressing the President of Parliament and all of us: the referenda and the crisis involve us and affect us, but they have never questioned the work carried out by this Parliament in the constitutional triangle. In difficult times, our Parliament has been able to launch ideas and summon the European spirit. After years in which discussion has taken place on Europe for the people, it has to be us who must learn to communicate with the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that this Parliament, always orderly, always working according to the rules and the schedule, must also demonstrate that it will not carry on with business as usual, and that we have understood both the unease of the people and the unsatisfactory responses of many governments. We will try to remember that the Commission will certainly be the custodian of the treaties, but that we are the representatives of the European people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think more presidencies with such a pro-European attitude and less in the way of a pettifogging national outlook on the part of whatever government is at the helm would do us all a lot of good.</p>
<p class="contents">In the aftermath of the summit, Europe is the subject of much negative language and sentiment. We did of course have something of a hangover in the first few days after it was over, and I am glad that our Prime Minister – in the Luxembourg parliament yesterday and in this House today – has regained his old form, and that we are aware of the need, more than ever, for a forward-looking and positive attitude to this Europe of ours. The crisis is made less profound by the fact that more members of the public than ever before are taking an interest in Europe, and there are two things that they want: they want more input into debates, and they want Europe’s actual policies to go in a different direction. As far as the new direction for European policy is concerned – and I see Mr Barroso looks to be already on the edge of his seat with anticipation – it is my view that, having presided over the Commission for a year, you really should think about to what extent your Commission’s decisions on Bolkestein, the Working Time Directive, REACH and climate change have helped to promote a positive attitude to Europe, or whether, on the other hand, they tend to turn even more members of the public against the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, in Luxembourg, on 10 July, we will be campaigning for the Constitution. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be doing our bit to help get a ‘yes’, for Europe is not the problem, and this Constitution is not the problem, but rather the solution to our problem.</p>

The Dutch ‘no’ is final. Those are not my words but of Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister, in today’s <span class="italic">Volkskrant</span>. Following the Dutch and French voters’ rejection of the proposed text of the Constitution, most national governments are now opting for a time of reflection. Will this be a time for those in government to reflect on their tactics or will it offer the opportunity to change and improve the Constitution by means of a broad social discussion involving the general public and social organisations? My party proposed a broad social discussion of this kind, and that proposal was adopted by the Dutch parliament; how will the Council help to ensure that there can be one across Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back, some advocates of the rejected text consider the no vote, above all, to be a vote against further enlargement to include countries with a low standard of living, particularly Turkey, and against financial solidarity with the poorest regions. It is probably far more important that many people feel angry about the differences that have grown over the years in terms of prosperity and input and about the uncertain future. They fear that Europe will increasingly resemble the USA. They are also indignant about projects that are vulnerable to fraud and about subsidies being poured into large agricultural companies. The unnecessary pumping of structural fund monies among the richest Member States is another cause of irritation. Does Mr Juncker agree with me that the neoliberal policy of emphasis on the market has helped foster opposition to this Constitution among the voters?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that last week, the Council did not make any hasty decisions about random cutbacks or the exclusion of new Member States. First of all, we must discuss what we want, about what Europe does and does not do. Studies can show that people do want to tackle the large-scale and cross-border issues in order to protect man and the environment more effectively, while they want minimal interference in national, regional and local democracy. Is the Council prepared to start such a study? I would like a response to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a few days’ time, it will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of Giuseppe Mazzini, a prophet of a Europe of the peoples, and the founder of the ‘Young Europe’ movement<span class="italic">. </span>What is emerging from the discussions of the European Council is more reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna than of that great patriot’s vision of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The voice of the peoples must be heard, not the interests of high finance. It is the peoples that suffer, together with the real economy, as a result of the havoc and failures of the euro. So why not hold a referendum on the euro? Instead, after having heard the results of the referenda, you write in your conclusions that the recent developments do not challenge the legitimacy of continuing the ratification process. Nothing changes. The bogus assumptions about this European integration, such as the claim that the nations of which it is composed, the body of this Europe, are disappearing, are therefore not taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, they have not disappeared: there is still a vestige of national sovereignty left. A lot has, however, been expropriated: monetary sovereignty has been expropriated, and, as a result of that, we want to give the decision on the euro back to the people, because the people very often say: enough of the euro. It is the Member States, the nations, that are the repositories of the democratic will of the citizens, not your technobureaucracy that is accountable to no one. Those discussions, that end of Europe is the result of your method of enlargement. Even Mr Prodi is now distancing himself from enlargement and from the decision on Turkey. It is a little too late, however. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one should rejoice at this crisis, however, regardless of the reasons behind it. The Polish delegation to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group may well be opposed to the Constitutional Treaty, but this does not mean that we are opposed to the European Union itself. The latter is something we should all value. No one should make rash judgments either. One cannot help thinking, however, that even though the old Member States have quarrelled for years over whether priority should be given to structural reforms and more effective measures or to regulations that enhance social solidarity, the EU now appears to be saying that it has no interest in either efficiency or solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet no one can claim that the recent EU enlargement is the cause of the crisis. No one should lay the blame on the new Member States, or on the 150 Polish plumbers working in France, who are in any case unable to meet the current demand for plumbing services in that country. The problems we are experiencing with regard to the new Financial Perspective do not boil down to a simple dispute over money. There is no longer any point in holding debates on the EU’s future on the basis of such obsolete ideological concepts as ‘liberalism’ or ‘social model’, because jobs cannot be created without growth. On the whole, the EU’s economies are over-regulated, and in addition, unemployment is not falling. Unless we want to escalate the crisis further, we must develop a job-creation strategy based on more effective action, enhanced competitiveness and higher incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another dimension to this crisis, namely the failure of the Constitutional Treaty. If its architects were keen to hear what the EU’s citizens had to say, then they have achieved their goal. The only problem is that the EU’s citizens have voiced their national opposition to a federal EU. The European project therefore needs to be thoroughly reconsidered, and the reforms must start from grass-roots level. Attempts by an all-seeing elite to bestow happiness on people by force always prove counter-productive.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to the common foreign policy, with regard to which people quite obviously have varying and divergent priorities. I say this in view of Mr Juncker’s comments on improvements in the EU’s relations with Russia. I would ask whether it is not the case that relations have improved because the EU has turned a blind eye to Russia’s impertinent treatment of Poland and the other new Member States. Unless the common foreign policy is to be devoid of any practical sense, it should seek to achieve a minimum level of security for all Member States, rather than to promote the interests of individual countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sorry that the Luxembourg presidency will be connected with the failure of the Constitutional Treaty. I must say, however, that it is precisely the inability of the Council to deal with the current situation that demonstrates the necessity of the Constitutional Treaty. The Constitutional Treaty is not dead: it is, alas, the Council itself, unable to resolve this deadlock, that is dead and ineffective. Council members cannot agree, as they struggle to protect their political hides in the domestic arena.</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is the European Parliament and the European Commission that know how to agree and adopt majority decisions. Both these institutions work and take decisions that directly affect the lives of the people of the European Union. It was stated during your presidency that the targets set by the Lisbon strategy are unrealistic. But the reality, that is, a proposed solution, was not offered to us, and remains a hot potato for the next presidency. And unfortunately not even the next presidency is a guarantee that the Lisbon strategy will be resolved rather than merely criticised.</p>

Listening to Mr Juncker, I was proud to belong to a Europe presided over by a man of such quality. You have shown that the authority of a Presidency can be measured by its willingness to place the common interest above its own national interest and it is on this criterion that, from tomorrow, we will judge your successor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add three comments on the financial perspectives. The first is that certain governments are calling for all the EU’s policies to be sent back to the drawing board, which is what the European Parliament did after the nine months of work by its temporary committee. Our Parliament has succeeded in making difficult choices between old policies and new ones. The Council could benefit from taking inspiration from this example. I am sure that the future Presidency will find food for thought in it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that the lack of a position from the Council must not delay the implementation of the new cohesion policy or that of the new Framework Programme on Research. We propose to pursue legislation relating to the legal bases for the multi-annual policies so that those policies can enter into force on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment, finally, is that the Council has failed, not on the main subject of the level of budgetary expenditure, but on the method of financing a budget that has remained stable with respect to EU revenue. This confirms the analysis that we have made here right from the start. There can be no agreement on future expenditure without, at the same time, reform of the revenue system, and this subject is too important to be left just to the Ministers for Finance. Our Committee on Budgets invited the committees of the national parliaments to an initial exchange of views on this subject last week. We propose that the EU’s system of own resources should be examined in the context of an interparliamentary conference bringing together the European Parliament and the national parliaments to aid the governments in their search for the necessary compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, this period has also been rich in disappointments. We, too, have faith in the Lisbon Strategy, the key principle of which, solidarity, is one of the fundamental values for the European left. It is very important, even though we know that these last few days have not really been characterised by that solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This period has also been an experience with regard to the functioning of relations between the European institutions. Despite the improvements, we are not completely satisfied with the role that Parliament has been able to obtain in this legally complicated and uncertain situation. Those who opposed the rapid ratification of the European Constitution did not take account of the fact that, at the same time, they were weakening the position of the European Parliament: the progress of the Constitution in that regard has been replaced by a permanent and complicated necessity for political compromises. However, the Luxembourg Presidency’s message was clear: no to a two-speed Europe, yes to a social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the main starting objectives, the financial perspectives were not adopted. Despite the efforts of the new Member States, which were prepared to make many concessions during the Summit, the budgetary debate did not result in unqualified success. The President, though, has nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="contents">Drawing conclusions from the last six months, I am convinced that we will continue to travel together down the European road. I would like to think that, in deciding the itinerary, the small countries will also have a contribution to make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The clear ‘no’ votes in the two referenda have plunged the whole of the EU into a kind of vacuum, with great uncertainty about the future. I am naturally sorry that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitutional Treaty, but ‘no’ votes as clear as that must be respected. It would therefore be wise to stop and think and to devote some time now to analysis and listening and to reflection upon how we might move on so as to implement the reforms so badly needed by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis was of course exacerbated by the ‘budget fiasco’ but, in many ways, it is better to have no budget at all than a bad one. I do not think that this budget was especially modern. We cannot, however, put the whole of the EU in the deep-freeze and wait for the distrust felt by many towards the EU suddenly to disappear. More than ever, there is a need for leadership and for someone who dares to stand up for visionary ideals and for European cooperation and to defend the decisions taken in Brussels. In that context, the President-in-Office of the Council deserves all credit, partly for his candid speech and partly for his attempt to reconcile desires that are very much at odds with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow the muggy haze that has descended over the whole of Europe to put a stop to cooperation. We have an enormous amount to do. We have the Lisbon process and the myth-enshrouded Services Directive, which are genuinely needed. We must combat cross-border crime. We have the ambitious environmental work involving REACH, and there is an enormous amount to do within the foreign policy field. The list of foreign policy measures – 33 pages of the Council’s conclusions – was certainly compiled before the Council meeting even began but nonetheless gives the appearance of high ambition and a large degree of unity, something that is extremely commendable. The EU has, and must continue to have, a large role to play in the surrounding world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned, however, about enlargement, which is passed over almost in silence in the conclusions from the Council meeting. We cannot use the referenda as pretexts for putting enlargement on ice in any way. The enlargement of just over a year ago to include ten new Member States is a brilliant success for the whole of the European idea. Unifying East and West is the best thing we have done. The European home, which does not at the moment perhaps feel so warm and cosy, must be open to our neighbouring countries when they fulfil the necessary requirements. We cannot convey the impression of the enlargement process too being put on hold and of their having to wait. In many ways, Europe is the answer to what is at issue in these countries, even if it does not perhaps quite appear to our own people to be the answer to their questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon, it will be the summer recess for all our institutions. There is perhaps more need than ever to take a few weeks’ rest, to pause for reflection and to reflect upon how we are to move on. I believe that, in the long run, something good will prove to have come out of this crisis. Europe is worth it, but in that case we must really make an effort and ensure that the current hiatus in the ratification process does not also extend to the whole of European cooperation, for that would be disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I echo all the gratitude that has been expressed, and wish to add another bloom for the courage that this presidency, the government of Luxembourg, has displayed by organising the referendum and pressing on with the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be, Mr Schmit, that the result of this decision will be that there will one day be only one founding state in a politically united Europe rather than six of them, and that country will be little Luxembourg. It may be that this decision represents the victory of the idea of a politically united Europe over the vulgar idea of a common market, of the ideal of uniting people over the mere claim to be uniting markets, market forces and resources. Today and tomorrow see two Europes meeting head-on in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office gave us a thoughtful speech, reminding us of the case for a political Europe. Tomorrow we will hear someone who broadcasts abroad for all to hear the propaganda of a Europe of nationalism and national corridors of power, adducing also the Rumsfeld formula according to which Europe is divided into ‘old’ and ‘new’, and thereby taking us back to the 19th century, to a Europe characterised by balances of power, by struggles for might, by competition, nationalistic egoism and hegemonistic politics, to a Europe that is not ours. I hope that the referenda will not be misinterpreted and will not be turned on their heads in such a way that their outcomes can be used against the public, but that they will be used in the manner in which they were intended, as a means of moving Europe forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is disappointing to see how various Heads of Government throw their entire weight behind a text that has, to all intents and purposes, been thrown out, thus needlessly obstructing the reflection on Europe’s future. Moreover, the Summit of 16 and 17 June clearly underlines the collapse of this Constitution. The optimistic references to a common destiny in the preamble ring false in the ears of someone from a country that, while supposedly fat and stuffed to the gullet, refuses to do anything for poor countries. In that sense, a reflection on the subject of ‘diplomatic choice of words’ is of primary importance for Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the<span class="italic"> </span>impasse surrounding the EU’s multi-annual budget cannot be seen in isolation from the current institutional crisis in Europe. The discussion about the EU’s future budget is closely related to the debate about the European Constitution. It is impossible, and indeed undesirable, to indicate policy priorities in a new multi-annual budget and to allocate funds to them while the reflection period and the reformulation of the EU’s mandate are still in full swing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must take the public’s objections about the speed and course of the European integration process seriously. The citizens want sound European cooperation in respect of which national interests are not immediately labelled as selfish or nationalistic. The public wants a Europe that does not get caught up in federal dreams but that tackles cross-border issues dynamically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the President of your government was expressing everybody's feelings when he said quite clearly that he felt ashamed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredible that certain Member States should make all kinds of statements of a Europeanist nature, saying that they want more Europe inside and outside our borders, while at the same time they demand a drastic reduction in their contribution to the Union’s budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for certain governments to complain about their net contribution to the European Union without taking account of their commercial balance with the other Member States. The case of Germany in relation to certain Member States, such as my own, Spain, speaks volumes. Germany's net deficit with the European Union is less than my country’s commercial deficit with, in fact, Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is it acceptable, Mr Schmit, that certain Heads of Government should say one thing within the Council and then say something quite different to the media in their countries. I would therefore like to ask whether it is true that there have even been certain Member States that have promised their support in the final vote and have then changed their minds and voted against. I would ask you to respond. It is precisely because of cases such as this, and regardless of what is laid down in the draft Constitutional Treaty, that debates in the Council must be made transparent, however shameful they may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Minister, I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10th. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have seen once again that the European leaders have not been a match for the circumstances: they have been unable to go beyond their exercise in national accounting, and at a crucial moment of crisis, they have been unable to show any positive sign of a forward-looking political vision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has done its job; as has the European Parliament: it has adopted its position by a large majority and, for the first time in its history, showing responsibility and taking account of the economic difficulties faced by certain Member States, it has proposed slightly lower figures than those proposed by the Commission. Both the Commission and Parliament have done their duty. On the other hand, the Council is having increasing difficulties adopting a position and this is regrettable since it leads to a lack of leadership which undermines the foundations of European integration and confidence amongst the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that our group will stand by its commitments and that, if no financial perspectives are forthcoming, it will fully apply the provisions of Article 272 of the Treaty and will try to establish annually the figures that this Parliament has approved with a view to guaranteeing Community action. We still want to make progress with European integration and we therefore need the resources that this House has indicated in its capacity as budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious, representatives of the Council: it is not possible at the last minute to say that we must change the Union’s spending philosophy, it is not possible to advocate that we must spend more money on policies which create more added value and less on agriculture. What were certain people thinking in October 2002, when they approved the spending for the period we are dealing with? We must respect the commitments we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Socialist Group, and for the Council as well, I hope, the Lisbon Strategy and, hence, economic and social cohesion, are the mid-term development objective. We would be delighted to have many more resources, we are aware of the achievements of governmental cooperation in relation to the Lisbon objectives. I would therefore like to point out that all policies ultimately find their expression in the budget. If the financial perspectives offer any added value, it consists of safeguarding and guaranteeing the programming of the Union’s cohesion policies, which, apart from being a mechanism for solidarity and for correcting territorial imbalances, are the most important Community public instrument, and are able to generate investment, economic growth and employment, and hence attract the citizens to the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Gentlemen of the Council — and I say gentlemen because there are no ladies — on behalf of my Group, I would ask you to show responsibility. The ‘no’ in the referenda and the lack of agreement in the Council are simply two sides of the same coin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No agreement could be reached on its own view regarding the new financial perspective, although the current one is due to expire next year. Accordingly, it is an urgent matter to establish a new one.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament decided on its own position at the start of June. That decision was reached after a full examination of all the EU’s main policy areas. That is why Parliament’s conclusions are clear and sound.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit discussions were dominated by the quarrel between Great Britain and France over Britain’s rebate and the EU’s agricultural policy. Rarely, hardly ever in fact, have the Member State’s shares of net contributions become such dominant issues as now. Perhaps the only solution to the argument is to be found in the joint financing of agricultural subsidies, which Parliament is hinting at. Its gradual implementation at the same time as a reduction in Great Britain’s rebate could create an adequate basis for a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs an interinstitutional agreement on the financial framework. Without one, we could of course draw up an annual budget on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty, but it will not guarantee sustained and balanced development of the different policy areas. Most multi-annual programmes will be discontinued at the end of 2006. Of these, the main ones concern regional and structural policy, rural development, research and development policy, and many other areas. The new legislative plans for these areas are now being debated in Parliament, but it is difficult to make the final decisions when one does not know how much will be available in the form of appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation seems to become especially problematic with regard to the one issue that really is the focal point of the financial perspective, which is increased competitiveness. The intention is to treble research and development funds for growth and employment, the funding of training programmes, and Trans-European networks. The situation mow seems quite wretched. The funding would already have been halved in the proposals for a compromise, and now we do not have any finance policies at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional and structural policy also demands a solution. When financing for the present programming period was decided at the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin, just six months before that period began, the outcome was that structural policy should be put on hold for nearly three years. The Member States and the Commission did not have time to draw up and adopt the programmes faster. Now the situation is still more difficult, as we have 10 new Member States for which it is a problem even to estimate the extent of future structural and cohesion policy. The next country to hold the presidency, Great Britain, cannot expect to while away the time doing nothing: we expect it to come up with proposals and solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are pro-European, we want a united Europe and we are working for it, but we the Catalans and other Europeans from stateless nations do not believe that we are going in the right direction on some issues.</p>

How can we talk of putting something off when it has already been killed off? There can be no resurrection for something that cannot be saved. The Council also lacks vision. Its President’s frankness only serves to show in stark relief the truth hidden from Europe by its governments. A prisoner of national egos, the Council has no political ambition of its own and tries to make omelettes without breaking eggs. With that shopkeeper mentality, we are doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">With the French vote, there is a before and an after. Either Europe wants to be purely a market or it endeavours to dig deeper and move forward by paying careful attention to the social reasons behind the referenda. Public opinion is the most significant new element to emerge from this crisis. This new player does not want less Europe, but, rather, more and better Europe. The answer is not to stop, but, rather, to have the courage to initiate a fresh, genuinely democratic, constitutional process; the answer is not to head down a cul-de-sac, but, rather, to have a Europe that is provided with its own resources and that is characterised by greater solidarity and a greater ability to combat unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Calling the people’s decision a crisis clearly demonstrates a genuine lack of belief in a democratic Europe. We must now state that the draft Constitution has come to nothing according to the EU’s own rules. Two founder countries have already rejected it. The matter is clear, so the question is: what shall we do now?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we must arrange a new Convention that must be appointed democratically so as to reflect the peoples’ opinions on this issue and not the elite’s. Three different issues must not then be mixed up, as has now happened. It was an attempt to impose upon the people of Europe something they did not want.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is a need to edit together treaties that have already been entered into so that they are clear and easy to understand. That is no great political issue. Rather, it is just a matter of simple editing. Secondly, we must revise the form to be taken by the rules for decision-making in those areas in which we have already said that we must take joint decisions. Thirdly, the draft Constitution included all sorts of plans for common defence, a common foreign policy and a host of other things that absolutely should not have been addressed in this context. Such issues should not be included in what looks like a Constitution. Instead, these are issues for the people of Europe to debate in the future.</p>

That sort of thing will not, however, do anything to help get Europe through the doubly grave crisis in which it finds itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes the crisis dual in nature is the fact that, on the one hand, the referenda in France and the Netherlands have shown evident and massive public rejection of the way the EU is going at present, irrespective of domestic political concerns, while, on the other, the failure of the summit has shown that, even at Council level, among the Heads of Government, the will towards a common way forward cannot be assumed. What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it. That having been said, this crisis should afford the opportunity for a radical change of direction, for a reorientation of the way Europe is going. Let us get away from a Union characterised by the egoisms of bureaucrats, lobbyists and technocrats with no knowledge of the people; let us move on to a Europe of self-determining peoples and mature citizens.

I believe he is right to call for a fundamental reform of the way the EU is funded, with particular focus on the common agricultural policy. It cannot be right that in a Union of 25 Member States, 42 per cent of our budget goes to the CAP, while less than 4 per cent of our workforce work in agriculture. Nor can it be right that although the CAP cake has to be shared between 25 Member States, one country gets a gigantic 23.4 per cent slice.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we tolerate a system that sees the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, sitting in session here in Brussels, demanding quite correctly ever more draconian regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products that kill half a million of our citizens every year, while across the corridor the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is happily voting for an annual subsidy to Europe’s tobacco farmers of more than EUR 1 billion?</p>
<p class="contents">Reform, however, is needed across a much wider field than simply the CAP. The people of France and the Netherlands showed us that we have lost touch with our own electors. It was a valuable lesson that we would do well to learn. Our brave words about achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, about facing up to the challenges of globalisation, about increased competitiveness and economic reform are never matched by brave deeds. We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive; we voted in this House to end the opt-out on the Working Time Directive, and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives: more red tape, more bureaucracy, more interference in the lives of our citizens. Do we really believe that this will increase our competitive advantage in the global market? Do we think this will achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy? I do not think so.

If the Constitution were in force, he would be able to be elected for two and a half years. Perhaps the summit has shown how important it is that the Council should develop in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the summit decided, not on a Plan B, which would involve halting the ratification process and re-negotiating the text, but on a Plan D, which involves proceeding with ratification while continuing with a debate – the great debate about Europe. You, Vice-President Wallström, now have in your hand the key that will unlock communication with the public in relation to the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the right strategy, and I wholeheartedly endorse it. I hope that the referendum in Luxembourg will be a success, for we will then have two popular ‘yes’ votes against two ‘no’ votes, which might give the go-ahead for agreement to the Constitution. We now need to debate what the EU is for and why we need it. The topics for debate are obvious, including as they do the role of the EU in globalisation, the exit routes from the economic and employment crisis, the EU’s frontiers and the question of how much wider we may set them, not to mention transparency and democracy within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">What I saw as missing from the summit resolution was any concept of how the debate should be structured. It is not enough to have 25 national debates in isolation from each other. We have to bring them together and create a synthesis right across the EU. If Giscard d’Estaing’s idea of a Congress of Peoples had not been blown out of the water after being proposed to the Convention, I would almost regard it as a good idea to hold an ad hoc assembly of the European Parliament and the national parliaments on that sort of platform. I hope in any case, though, that what comes out of this crisis will be a stronger Europe and a Europe closer to its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The achievement of peace and stability within Europe, the prosperity ensured by the construction of the internal European market through successive enlargements, and the fostering of the very many cultures within Europe, which can all be traced back to common Judaeo-Greco-Christian roots, make the founding fathers’ original project substantially complete, even if the full and necessary involvement of south-eastern Europe is still absent.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the same issues – peace, prosperity and identity – can only be resolved on an international scale, with global actors demanding a European actor that is equal to the task, more unified, more integrated, more directly accountable towards the European people, without unnecessary, if not downright harmful intermediation by the Member States, and, for that very reason, able to guarantee the objectives that the European people believe are no longer achievable with the Union of today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to mitigate the impact of external events, despite the bleak economic situation in many of the largest Member States and the difficult employment conditions, and despite a Council of 25 operating in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Nice and a Commission that is still not fully able to instil Community life into the work of the Union. The defence of the fundamental completeness of the Stability and Growth Pact, the stimulus to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, the open-handed and determined search for agreement on the budget, and the impetus provided by the Lisbon Strategy are facts that remain, to the credit of the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, the Luxembourg Presidency has taught us that the Union, in anticipation of more appropriate constitutional procedures, such as those laid down by the Constitutional Treaty, has to utilise every political resource in order to keep the process in balance, whilst allowing itself time to refocus on the fundamental objectives and methods of its own work. Without giving in to a state of panic, without preventing itself from continuing to utilise the existing treaties in order to protect and to increase the European <span class="italic">acquis</span> of common decisions, even starting with only apparently modest results, such as the European driving licence, which I hope can be approved in a few days’ time thanks to our codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, is now calling for a radical reform of agricultural policy. We are ready for it. His demand, though, is a hypocritical one, for he was among those who put the brakes on the last time there was a reform, when he prevented direct payments from being capped or staggered. He blocked the social cohesion that the coupling of premiums to each worker would have achieved. He prevented, and voted against, the reallocation of funds to the second pillar for innovation, work and the environment and for the economic development of rural areas. What that boils down to is that his flagging up of agricultural policy is retribution for the demand – which most of us do in any case support – that the rebate be brought back onto the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pointed out that Mr Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate. I do not know whether Mr Juncker was being naive or arrogant, but last week he counted the cost of it.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary, thereby falling into a trap laid by President Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ‘no’ vote. In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be. His window of opportunity was almost closed, the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency. Mr Juncker is right about one thing: the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes. His quote, ‘I want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treaty’, will go down in history as being typical of the attitude of the EU’s political elite in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Devon, where we are often referred to as simple country folk. Despite – or perhaps because of – my simplistic outlook on life, I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand. It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence, you have to vote ‘no’. Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonian’s ability to understand it.

<p class="contents">From this, however, some good could come. If the effect was to jolt European leaders into the same reality stream that many of their people already occupy, then a workable Europe could emerge.

A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit, and not for the unworkable, unwanted ever-closer union, has some hope of success.</p>

<p class="contents">However, the debate, on the initiative in particular of one country, has opened up and gone beyond the bounds of the predefined Brussels agenda. For example, the subject of the common agricultural policy has been raised. I wonder why those who raised the subject were unable to raise it in 2002 when they signed off everything to do with the CAP and the agricultural budget up to 2013. I wonder if they would all be prepared to set an example by cutting back the budgets for their large-scale farmers. The south of Europe cannot pay for the costs of enlargement, nor can the previous cohesion countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of a new model for Europe has also been raised, but every model for Europe requires financing. More Europe also means more money. We cannot talk about a new vision for Europe with just 2.5% of public spending at European level making up the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">What Europe needs today more than ever is bold and visionary leadership; leadership which looks to future generations, rather than to future elections. Our political leadership should not present Europe either as a 'coat hanger' for its responsibilities or as a necessary evil.

I think that, in the years to come, whenever the situation becomes difficult, we will refer to this method.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, it is with real bitterness that I now address you following this summit and its result regarding, in particular, the financial perspectives. Far be it from me to be provocative, but I am personally embarrassed and even ashamed at the image of national egotism presented by some European states. Overly attached to their historical advantages, they have been taught a valuable lesson in Europe by the new countries. Once again, the Council has illustrated a political adage from Corrèze: promises only bind those who believe in them. The citizens, though, are starting to no longer believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Gentlemen of the Council <span class="bold">–</span> in passing, I would point out that there were very few women there and I think that parity within the Council would bring progress in the political habits of that institution <span class="bold">–</span> so, gentlemen of the Council, what has become of your commitments to boost growth and innovation so that everybody can find a good job, a place in our society? Keeping your word is doubtless an antiquated, outmoded virtue, but, at the foot of the budgetary wall, the Council’s word disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were afraid of in Parliament, therefore, happened in the Council. The resolution that we broadly adopted, though, was very moderate in view of our projects and, over seven years, enabled certain policies to be developed realistically. That is my only satisfaction as an MEP and as a European citizen. We in Parliament are prepared to continue negotiations with the European Council as soon as it has its feet back on the ground, but above all when it has resumed the progression of a true political project. Each country still needs to be convinced that the added value that we gain as 25 Member States is much greater than our contributions to the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European utopia does exist, but it needs a broader, more generous, more ambitious, more humanist vision with greater solidarity, shared by the citizens and respected by the Council, so that, together, we can confront reality and future challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Luxembourg Presidency, in its commendable effort to address them all, has confirmed its own political ability and its determined support for the Community project. It then suffered an unfortunate setback in the European Council last Thursday and Friday, which, without doubt, does not help Europe to build an effective relationship with the citizens, a relationship that is genuinely based on the element of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, add, Minister, that I was not so impressed with the position of the current Presidency on the resources for the cohesion policy in the next programming period. With regard to the original, very restrictive proposal, a step forward was made at the start of the summit, which I personally do not believe was satisfactory, and which, in fact, if it were translated into an agreement, would not have provided an adequate response to the demands for balanced development in the regions lagging behind. Parliament, however, had sent out a significant positive signal by approving the Böge resolution by a large majority and by reaching full agreement with the position of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it possible that all of that is of no importance whatsoever? Is it possible, therefore, not to take account of the opinion of 426 – that was how many of us voted – democratically elected Members?</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I hope – and I conclude – that after last week’s unpleasant test, a balanced agreement is reached, mindful of the prevailing positions, and that that occurs as soon as possible, without indulging in the extended time still available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Satisfaction about the fact that under the Luxembourg Presidency, the Lisbon strategy was given another shot in the arm and can really get underway now that this last, particularly tricky summit has approved the integrated guidelines. What this shows is that social cohesion, sustainable development and the new emphasis on growth and jobs remain priorities shared by the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Member States play a leading part in this strategy, now and in future, but also that Europe has a task of its own. In order to be able to carry out our part of the bargain, we need money; the failure to reach agreement on the financial package means that this is not, or is in any case insufficiently, forthcoming. It is shameful for various reasons, which have been explained here by others, certainly in respect of the new Member States. What is particularly unfortunate is the embarrassing manner in which the lack of political will to further develop the European Union together was exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">And to develop it into what? Let us make good use of the active period of reflection, which we do, after all, have at our disposal. We should use that time to turn the European Union once more into a project with visible added value, added value for all those people who worry about their jobs, who worry about their companies relocating and who are frightened by immigration. People who find the EU’s enlargement too much to handle because they were given far too little information in their own countries and who also fear the globalisation process, which they do not know to be guided in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Should there be a supreme being, should Zeus still be around, he should be able to fall in love with Europa once again. I think we should ensure that we offer the people a Europe of that kind, a Europe with charisma, a Europe that is attractive once more. The Luxembourg Presidency is now coming to an end. I am sure that I speak for many when I say that I continue, even once June is past, to count on your commitment and your conviction. I also think that I speak for many, Mr Juncker, when I say that we are grateful for your transparency and your honesty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To paraphrase Mr Juncker, the European Council was not a failure of the Presidency, but a failure of Europe. It was a huge disappointment. The citizens expected a strong message, but received a response that was devoid of quality, of ambition and of a rallying idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union thus missed out on a unique opportunity to convey an image of strong, unified leadership. European leaders were not equal to the task that history had set them. National interests prevailed over the Union’s values and selfishness spoke louder than solidarity. Let us now take this opportunity to look for answers to the citizens’ questions, such as: What is Europe’s role in the world? How do we increase productivity and competitiveness in a globalised world? How do we reduce unemployment? How do we implement social cohesion? What social model should we follow?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe may be at a crossroads, but history teaches us that it is at times of crisis that the best transformations can be effected. Let us hope that we prove capable of transforming difficulties into opportunities. The world has changed and the citizens’ concerns and needs have changed. The EU must keep up and must begin by forging a new relationship with the citizens. Change does not mean changing something so that everything remains the same, as one of Lampedusa’s characters suggested – that would be a confidence trick.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can live without a Constitutional Treaty, but it is doubtful whether it could live without agreement on the Financial Perspective. Europe must be a political Union, an area of cohesion and solidarity, and not merely a free trade area. This is the challenge facing the forthcoming Presidency, which I hope is capable of giving us a pleasant surprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are glad that Europe can again breathe with two lungs. In the Council, there appear to be those who are playing the ‘new for old’ and ‘future not past’ cards. While this House adopts the Constitutional Treaty by a two-thirds majority, there is no shortage of Heads of Government who cannot get a majority for more democracy, citizens’ rights and transparency in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Parliament, out of the desire to make the European Union more effective, efficient and economical, adopts the Financial Perspective, there are Heads of Government sitting on the Council who disregard their own decisions, ignore treaties, undermine the common goal of developing the European Union further into a political union and fail to abide by the rules of the institutions, believing as they do that they can cope on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the impression that there are too many for whom mass appeal in their own countries is more important than their responsibility to the Community, who prefer to blame others rather than share responsibility and opt for egoism rather than solidarity. If you want to regain the public’s confidence in the European project as a success story, you cannot make them believe things, you cannot take them for mugs or ignore their worries and fears; instead, you have to meet them halfway, tell them how things are, do what you have decided to do and keep to what you have agreed. If you want to put an end to double standards behind padded doors, you have to give parliaments more of a say in decision-making processes and say a resounding yes to the Constitutional Treaty. If you want to replace egoism with solidarity, you have to contend for the social market economy.

I think that it was a great moment to hear a description of the work of the European Council, in application of the concept of transparency. It was very useful for such a report to be given in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank him, too, for the conclusions to which he managed to bring the European Council with regard to ratification of the Constitution. I think that each population is free to decide whether or not it wants to continue with this process. In addition, a pause is vital because what can we do when a question is asked and we do not have the answer? Nobody yet knows what the French or Dutch will say in future, on what text, under what conditions. It is a question that is still ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to give certain speakers and perhaps the Members of the Commission or others a warning. Saying that there is a problem of communication, and that it is because of this communication problem that two referenda resulted in a ‘no’, is a mistake. It is to imagine that the citizens do not understand. That is what this argument implies. I think that the citizens knew perfectly well what they were doing when they voted, and claiming that they voted the wrong way because they did not understand is, in a way, advocating a return to selective suffrage. I do not imagine that anyone in this House would call for such a development.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the budget, I think that the Luxembourg Presidency has tried everything. The question is not really whether we are faced with national egos. It is whether we want to continue with a strategy of going the extra mile and of European added value. For this reason, we need to establish whether or not this terrible logic of a fair return, which was instituted by Mrs Thatcher several years ago and clearly continues to be favoured by some, must finally be sent back to the drawing board. In that respect, I think, Mr Juncker, that you have made some good proposals. We must continue with this debate. What I think is a shame is that, in the end, the grand ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be served by the financial perspectives they need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That much is apparent from what the voters in France and the Netherlands have done, and in doing it they surely represent many others. Their motivations as individuals may differ, but what underlies them can be found throughout the European Union. If we are to regain the public’s confidence, we have to bring about a change in direction and a change in European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only a few comments to make on this. For a start, we do not want a constitution. The mere term ‘constitution’ is redolent of a European superstate; nobody wants one, and we are not even trying to build one. What we do need, though, and urgently, is a basic agreement setting out how decisions are to be taken in the European Union, and how the institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission – relate to one another. We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights in an agreed form. Such are the essential elements of what we need, and of what will enable us to organise and manage a Union of 25 or even more Member States in an orderly fashion. We have to enable the public to understand and get a handle on enlargement, and that means that Europe needs borders. A halt must be called to the process of enlargement until such time as we have consolidated the last additions, and I would also point out that most people in Europe would feel themselves affronted if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to start on 3 October. What is needed is a privileged partnership with Turkey, rather than for it to become a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that a new culture of subsidiarity is called for in the Commission’s bureaucracy. The Commission must give thought to how many regulations have to be enacted in Brussels and about the point at which the Member States should assume responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, you are concluding your Presidency with a summit that has produced neither decisions on the budget nor a new treaty. Unfortunately, few people talk about the excellent foreign policy decisions taken. Thank you for all you have achieved. During its period of office, Luxembourg has ensured that Bulgaria and Romania will become Members and that Turkey will be allowed to begin negotiations in October. You have made history, and I would thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is emphatically not in crisis, because the debate is most certainly not now about countries wanting to leave the EU. Rather, what has emerged from the referenda is that people want the EU to do more of the right things and the Council to concentrate on the right things, a state of affairs that would be better for the future. People want us to be clearer about the objectives, that is to say more jobs, a proper state of affairs in the labour market, social responsibility, international solidarity, the fight against crime, sustainable development and gender equality. At long last, we are obtaining a debate in our Member States about the future in which Europeans now wish to participate. It is not enough for ourselves here in Brussels to do lots of good things if no one knows about what we are doing or takes any notice of it</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful and I look forward to a lively debate, but this time involving everyone who wishes to participate. Let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes, be issued with yellow cards or be depressed. We should pause for thought but not be passive. Let us challenge people and call for them to be committed and to provide answers to questions as guidance on how we want the EU to develop. We need to listen more and talk less. That is difficult for us politicians, but it would mean that we should emerge strengthened from this period of reflection. Finally, the debate is about politics and the future and objectives of the EU, and it is something I welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, a large majority of this House has spoken out in favour of cutting back where possible but also investing where necessary, which was also the thrust of the Böge report. In the Council too, the differences have become more negligible than many people had thought possible. I appreciate the presidency’s efforts in this respect and also what Mr Juncker said, namely that he tried to reach out to the Netherlands even further.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying this for selfish reasons, but only to indicate that a country such as the Netherlands does not mind paying up. If, however, newspapers carry reminders, year in and year out, that the Dutch contribute many times more than other rich countries, then the Netherlands, having been a pro-European country, will eventually end up being sceptical. The Netherlands will soon need to get back on track in a referendum, and we must all find our bearings again.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also learn from those referenda. There were many reasons for the no-vote. Something that definitely played a role is a certain fear among people of how fast enlargements are carried out and of where they will stop. We must explain in more specific terms that enlargements are not detrimental to us, but beneficial and what they have brought us. We must also ensure that the enlargement processes that are currently underway remain credible. That means that not only the position of candidate Member States must be taken seriously, but also the criteria we prescribed in respect of enlargements, and that guarantees must be put in place to this effect. We all carry some of the responsibility in this, not least with regard to the criterion that Europe must be able to handle the enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not had an easy time of it, and if anyone was able to cope, it was this President of the Council, Mr Juncker, and his team. It is impressive how he, time and again, underlined the idea that Europe is about cooperation, is more than just a free trade area, not only in his work and during negotiations, but also here today when he reminded us about the end of the Second World War sixty years ago with all the empathy one would expect.</p>
<p class="contents">I told Mr Juncker a moment ago that he is a leader of a small country but a big leader in Europe, and I am convinced that, if we carry on as he has begun, we will soon harvest what the Luxembourg Presidency has sowed during this difficult time. I thank you, I thank the Presidency, and let us continue the good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If it is true that they depend on an increasing cohesion of European nations, of their mutuality and solidarity, then all of us who believe in the European idea must, at this very time of crisis, place in much sharper focus the dilemma we now face. Will we be capable of giving the idea of political union some new impetus, some new inspiration, and can we move ahead, or will we be content merely with a common market, and in this sense take a step backwards? Almost twenty years ago now, it was determined correctly that a common market alone could not provide an adequate response to the challenging issues facing Europe. And twenty years later this idea can respond to these needs so much less.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have therefore found ourselves in a crisis, then I propose that we do not resolve it with some minor corrections, but rather that we focus back on the fundamental issues. This includes – and I do not advocate the approach of Prime Minister Blair, although I would like to draw attention to a certain position of his which seems to me relevant to our deliberation over this future – whether from the aspect of the Lisbon objectives it is right for us to allocate almost half of the Union’s entire budget to agriculture, while we are so effortlessly willing to cut financing for the fundamental measures and instruments of the Lisbon strategy: science, education and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these are the relevant, fundamental issues that we should now be addressing. And the more courageously we respond to these issues, the greater our chances will be of finding a good solution to the bind in which we find ourselves.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And I would put the question: who was talking about Europe when the financial perspectives were being negotiated? Nobody talked about Europe. Everybody talked about their national interests. Actually that is not true, Mr President: some people talked about Europe, those we call the ‘new countries’ talked about Europe, the countries of the last enlargement. I believe that, if there has been an example of vision and ambition at this Summit <span class="bold">–</span> the vision and ambition that has always characterised Europeanism <span class="bold">–</span> then that example has been given by the new countries. I therefore propose that we stop calling them ‘new countries’, because they have shown that they do not need to take lessons in Europeanism from anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Lamassoure, I too believe that we will certainly have to reflect upon the system of own resources. We tried that in the Convention — some of you will remember — but there was no way of introducing anything. In fact, there was a small group in the European Convention considering how to introduce a new system of own resources into the Constitution. We will have to return to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I believe that what is going to happen in practice, which is the suspension of the referenda, is a good thing: this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate. I therefore believe that the idea of establishing the end of the Austrian Presidency as the time for relaunching the process is a good one and I believe that this Parliament must begin to consider what it is going to do in the future. In this respect, the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow contains a clause that moves in that direction and I believe that it conforms to that ‘d’ for determination that Mr Juncker urged us to show and that I am sure this Parliament will agree with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, on having maintained its referendum. And thirdly, because Mr Juncker spoke very clearly yesterday, at the summit with the United States, when he used a phrase that filled me with pride and emotion: ‘Europe is not on its knees’. That is more or less what those of us, for example, who represented this Parliament as observers during the Lebanese elections that ended this weekend, said: Europe exists and furthermore it is useful, not just for the Europeans, but also for the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We should reflect, I agree, but to what end? So that we can remain in limbo, so that we can go backwards, have less Europe, come to a halt and ultimately allow the rhythm of the world to overtake us? No, not for that reason: we must reflect so that we can continue to make progress, that is to say, to bring the European Constitution into being. I believe that we must state very clearly that, if we believe that the European Constitution is good, it must not be renegotiated and that, however long it may take, the citizens must express their opinion on it, either directly or by means of their parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you, Mr President, that it is not the case that there have only been two referenda so far and that they have both said ‘no’: there have been three referenda: the first was in my country, with 77.7% voting in favour of the European Constitution. In fact, if we add up the ‘yes’ votes and the ‘no’ votes in the referenda held to date, there are more ‘yes’ votes than ‘no’ votes, and far more countries have said yes to the European Constitution than no. But we are facing the usual problem: a genuine debate between Eurosceptics and Europeanists, between those who want more Europe and those who want less Europe. I am one of those who want more Europe and I therefore believe, from the point of view of the left, that what the citizens want is more and better Europe, a more democratic and more efficient Europe. And that is why we need this Constitution, which is a point of balance, but above all a point of progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on having been, for almost six months, a good Presidency, I could say a full Presidency, without a moment’s rest, a committed Presidency, a political Presidency and an effective Presidency. True, the last Council did not give the results we were hoping for, but Mr Juncker has given us a clear explanation of the content of the negotiations, of the British rebate and of the funding of the common rural policy, which represents, I would remind you, just 0.4% of the EU’s GDP. We were a few millimetres from agreement, when the Presidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometres, and that is really something to regret.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is one subject on which the Council has been particularly discreet, to a certain extent appropriately, and that is the subject of enlargement. I, though, would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency, up to the end of June, and the next one will have to ask themselves whether, with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, we can make it seem that, and act as if, nothing had changed since December 2004, as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts, as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget: it has no Constitution, it has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would say very clearly that I think that, at the moment, we are not meeting the Copenhagen criterion on the ability of the EU to take on new members without losing momentum, and I would simply say, Mr President, that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people: Europe is taking its destiny back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was confirmed in the most decisive manner by the Luxembourg Presidency, by Mr Juncker personally and by the foreign ministers, Mr Asselborn and Mr Schmit. The European cycle gave the Presidency to Luxembourg at a particularly critical turn on the path towards European unification.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the negative referenda in France and the Netherlands, the European Union is now in a state of institutional, political and strategic crisis. This crisis was confirmed and reinforced by the breakdown of the European Council, despite the brave and honourable efforts made by the Luxembourg Presidency to broker a reasonable compromise on the subject of the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">At this European Council, it was not only political will that was lacking. Unfortunately, there was a serious lack of political leadership and management of European developments. It is a European Council of political confusion and political cowardice, as the conclusions record. It is a European Council of the deconstruction and deregulation of the objective of deepening European integration. It is a European Council of the deconstruction of political union and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a European Council typified by the fear of the leaders in the face of the fear of the citizens. A typical example is the reference to the enlargement procedure. As the fabricated fear of enlargement affected the ratifying process in France and the Netherlands, it was judged expedient to dedicate literally two lines, almost hidden away in the conclusions, to a strategic plan to foster peace, security, stability, development and, more importantly, the political and social democratisation of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A strategic plan which gave people hope of breaking out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and autocracy and putting European principles and values into practice. This strategic plan, which made the European Union a strong, international factor, is not defended by anyone today in the face of the fear cultivated by the more conservative and xenophobic political forces in Europe.</p>

The decision to pause for reflection on the Constitution merely underlines a lack of direction across Europe. When two founding Member States reject the Constitution with no expectation of holding a second vote, it is hard to see the logic of continuing the ratification process. We would have preferred the Council to have acted decisively, accepted the will of the voters and moved on. Of course there still is a time for a real debate about Europe’s future. Like the British Government, we believe that Europe must face up to some profound questions. The move to political integration has reached its high water mark. It is against this backdrop that, with respect, I have to disagree with the President-in-Office when he said that he did not believe the French or the Dutch voters rejected the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Such statements damage the relationship between politicians and the people, and if ever there was a time for politicians to demonstrate that they are listening, it is now. It would be folly for Europe’s leaders just to ignore the reality of what has happened. This crisis was avoidable: for many years my party has argued for a more flexible Europe. For too long the European integration process has carried on as a project of the political elite. That is now over and we, the representatives of the people, are now charged with conducting further debate on the kind of Europe we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who have opposed that integration process have often been criticised, and many in this Chamber believe it is the only way forward, but it is not. In the coming months we will argue positively and enthusiastically for a different kind of Europe that goes with the grain of public opinion and not against it; a Europe that gets away from the obsessions of the past and moves forward with the people’s real agenda, which is jobs, growth and prosperity. That is the way to re-engage the electorate with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that on this occasion the Council failed to show the necessary leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has demonstrated, yet again, that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States, for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations. As has been said repeatedly, they are not the cause of the problems of Europe. They in fact give us far more and offer us far more in terms of a peaceful, secure and prosperous future than we can offer them. I would also like to remind the House that 28 states – not 25 – participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania should be included in any debate now about the future of Europe. I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what kind of Europe we are going to have.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency, frankness and humanity. This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today.</p>
<p class="contents">My group leader, Mr Schulz, has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans. I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency, Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso, to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of Europe that we have a future together. We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of Mr Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe. It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe; from having a Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders, unable to share power and unable to share a future together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I should like to convey to him a personal thank you and also thank the entire Luxembourg presidency for its extremely important work. It is a great pity that the success that we had hoped for is still to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Now some words on the essence of the problem. Evidently, our electors, our people still do not understand that we face new challenges. If it was perhaps the case a few decades ago that we still had the Berlin Wall, we still had the cold war, and that this perhaps instinctively united people and allowed them to take common decisions more easily and to vote for them, none of that is present now. Perhaps people still do not perceive or understand this new challenge, this global competition that Europe faces, and not just every one individually, but Europe as a whole. That is why this medicine, this Constitutional Treaty, is essential. That is why it is also essential to look at what are Europe’s values; and Europe’s values today are obviously its people, for we have to take into account the demographic situation, which unfortunately is not a progressive one for Europe. I know that it is not progressive for my nation, but neither is it progressive for the whole of Europe. If we are becoming fewer, then every individual must be of a higher quality. Therefore our chief task is to invest in people, in people’s education; that is our future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is such an enormous difference between the propaganda and reality that the voters have stopped listening. If, for example, solidarity towards the new Member States is nothing more than a mention in a speech in honour of a special occasion, the people do not need to believe anything else that is said.</p>
<p class="contents">The mood now is that a referendum can be organised on any issue at all, and the answer will always be no. The leaders of nations have only themselves to blame. They lack the courage to tell the electorate that there is no alternative to globalisation, and that it cannot be opposed through political decisions, but that we could adapt to it by taking the right decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same leaders, who in speeches complain that the Lisbon strategy is very much late in coming, allow a situation where not even the decisions agreed in one country are implemented in their own. Instead, Brussels is blamed for the problems and setbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Referenda are not entirely appropriate as a tool of pan-European decision-making. National governments and parliaments should have the courage to make the necessary decisions. Explaining and justifying European policy is always a local issue, if we want people to understand our good intentions. In the end, however, the bills for our common decisions are paid for out of national budgets, and, consequently, only the French Government can explain to its citizens with any credibility that the position of agriculture in this continent has changed, and only the British can make their own citizens understand that the rebate Britain receives on its EU contributions originated in former times and in different circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would appear that Europe risks being divided into two camps; on the one side advocates of closer political integration combined with efforts to achieve a more social Europe, and on the other supporters of a Europe limited to the single market, with a looser institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I should like to stress is that the EU’s future is not a matter of choosing between these two approaches. The EU must continue to move towards a more stable institutional framework, just as it must reform its budget and concentrate its resources on areas that will allow us to compete on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">The incoming British presidency has gained considerable popularity in Central Europe as a result of its efforts to drive forward financial reform and economic modernisation. Yet such efforts must not go hand in hand with a weakening of the institutions. Similarly, there is public support for France and Germany’s attempts to achieve closer political integration, but not if this involves inefficient welfare systems and protectionist approaches being set in stone. We must settle the political dispute over economic and social strategies within the bounds of the existing institutional playing field. The EU will not find a way out of its current crisis if it tries to lay down its institutional framework at the same time as deciding on the content of specific policies. In other words, it must not attempt to mark out the playing field while deciding who has scored how many goals in which net.</p>
<p class="contents">The incoming presidency has a unique chance to make its attempts to reform the EU’s budget and economy more credible, namely by ensuring that its first objective is to achieve a more stable institutional framework on the basis of Parts One and Two of the Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the Luxembourg presidency for its work, which has been both highly professional and of first-rate quality. I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker. Although he comes from a small country, Mr Juncker is a great statesman and a great politician, and he has demonstrated quite clearly that small and medium-sized countries can also play a large role in Europe. In order to do so, they must remain true to the ideas that underpinned the gradual construction of Europe after the Second World War. I refer to such ideas as Europeanism, solidarity and the placing of European interests before individual, and often selfish, national interests. It is my belief that Jean-Claude Juncker will always serve as a fine example, in particular for the new Member States, or in other words the small and medium-sized countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency on the solution which it put forward to the problems surrounding ratification of the European Constitution, and which enables those Member States that so desire to continue the ratification process. I believe that the people of Luxembourg will vote ‘yes’ in the referendum to be held on 10 July. I hope that politicians in other countries, including my own country, the Czech Republic, will be equally courageous and allow their citizens to take part in referenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise one final issue that has not yet been touched upon, namely EU enlargement. Accession treaties were signed with Bulgaria and Romania during the Luxembourg presidency. In common with the majority of Members of this House, I supported this move, and despite the events in France and the Netherlands, I still believe that it was absolutely the right one. Regardless of the problems we are facing, we should not ignore the fact that the unification of Europe is in the interests of Europe as a whole, and in the interests of our history. Last year’s enlargement demonstrated that the problem does not lie with the new Member States, since they are acting with the utmost responsibility, whether with regard to ratification of the Constitution or to last weekend’s summit. I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will act equally responsibly after they join in 2007 or 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg; quite the contrary: it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while running presidencies in general. The speech today from Jean-Claude Juncker was one of the best that we have heard in this House for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a positive vision. I am sick and tired of listening to everyone blaming everyone, coming up with scapegoats. The two worst scapegoats that I have heard so far are firstly enlargement and secondly the liberalisation of markets. I do not think the results of the two referenda or the European Council should mean that we close the borders of Europe and stop competitiveness. Quite the contrary: the best thing that has happened to us in the past ten years are the last two rounds of enlargement. We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point that I wanted to make is that in Europe we now have a leadership vacuum. It is clear that France and Germany are no longer the engine of Europe. Someone needs to come and pick up the pieces and drive things forward. In the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person. If Tony Blair is the person, he needs to do two things. Firstly, he needs to argue for more, not less Europe. Secondly, he needs to combine this with economic reform. If he can do this he can grab the leadership vacuum, but unfortunately what we have seen and heard from Tony Blair when he has tried to get into the heart of Europe in the past is something that can be called ‘NATO’: ‘no action, talk only’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do little to restore the credibility of the EU as a global player. Furthermore they will not deliver on a forward-thinking budget that the 21st century EU requires.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity to overhaul the EU budget and to leave behind the antiquated system has, I believe, been missed both by the Commission and the Council. We are now faced with a budget where the only flagship policy is agriculture. This does little to captivate the imagination and aspirations of those we serve and has huge anomalies – not least vis-à-vis Luxembourg, the richest EU country and, at the same time, the largest net beneficiary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of today needs to face up to the challenges ahead and we need to learn this lesson now. Our citizens want us to create a better Europe, which means more economic growth and employment stability. Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, how can you justify cuts in the very areas that people want in terms of research funding, growth and jobs? Clearly we are not listening or delivering on our citizens’ priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to transparency, many people are asking why these talks are taking place behind closed doors. I suggest that if the Council wants to connect with the people out there, then it should leave these doors open and let the citizens hear the debate. All I can say is that I hope the UK presidency will make this its number one priority. Roll on the British presidency! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Point one: procedure for ratifying the Constitution. The <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> entry into a period of rethinking is bringing to the surface creative material for institutional, political and strategic self-criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Vice-President of the Commission is this: how does the Commission intend to address citizens' criticism about over-regulation and the excessive technicality of legislative proposals? Seriously, what has become of the White Paper on European governance?</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the President-in-Office of the Council is this: is there sufficient consultation of and information for civil society before and after the adoption of decisions by the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the President of the European Parliament is this: will the European Parliament be equal to its important role as a political body, as a forum for creative discussion of the stated will of the people, of the <span class="italic">communis opinio</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">The only way out of the constitutional and political crisis is to establish a permanent, transparent and democratic dialogue with civil society. If the constitutional crisis is not resolved by 2007, then we will need to move either towards a constitutional review or in the direction of 'Nice plus' or, finally, towards the option of reinforced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Τhe second point refers to the financial perspectives: we are being called upon to realise that ambitious objectives require the necessary financial resources. Enlargement also requires enlarged resources. The restoration of the historic and political unity of Europe brings to the surface new definitions of cohesion policy, a policy which signals, as a horizontal principle for the old and new Member States, a Europe of stability, of solidarity and of social prosperity. It is to this eminent political position that the common agricultural policy aspires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I awaited the results of the European Council in Vilnius, Lithuania, and watched Mr Juncker's press conference on television after midnight on Thursday. He looked very well and his emotion did little harm, but some others, to put it mildly, did not look so good. I do not doubt that the new Member States, including Lithuania, will appreciate the last six months of the presidency and the personal contribution made by Mr Juncker. Luxembourg has clearly demonstrated that the well-known definition of this state as ‘small, but notable’ is true. What would the European Union be without you!</p>
<p class="contents">History and past experience clearly shows that Europe, the European Union, was always strong when it gave precedence not to national interests, the demonstration of states' power and the personal ambitions of certain political leaders, but to common values and solidarity without denying internal competition, the engine of all progress. I believe that today, knowing and appreciating the results of the European Council, as well as the French and Dutch ‘no’ to the European Union Constitutional Treaty, and considering the nature of the United Kingdom's vision of the European Union, we also ought to analyse the cause of the current situation very carefully. The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty should not be an end in itself, and agitators and expounders will be of no help in this situation, no matter how highly qualified they are. The citizens' Europe proclaimed by us should become a reality, and this means that we must listen attentively to the voice of the citizens if we want to avoid renewed disillusionment.</p>
<p class="contents">Analysis shows that in France and the Netherlands the European Union Constitutional Treaty was largely rejected because the door was left open to Turkey to become a European Union member in the future. We also notice that the most sensitive issues today are employment, new jobs, the growth of economic competition and the further expansion of the European Union. These should be the signposts in our dialogue with the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to look elsewhere to find the reasons why we are standing here today empty-handed.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have spoken here today about Europe’s crisis, but this is not quite right. It is not Europe’s crisis; it is the crisis of the 15, and not only in a geographical sense. We need a new agreement, and one that clearly should cover much more than just money. Some want to speak about Lisbon, and about competitiveness. Well, let us do it! But let all twenty-five of us be involved. We cannot negotiate on competitiveness if our hands and feet are tied. We must review the regulations on free movement of persons – it is high time in any case. We must not make the same mistake with the free movement of services as we did with persons. When we were unable to resolve an issue politically, we put up administrative barriers. Some want to speak about agricultural policy. Fine, but I would remind you that we in the ten new Member States are contributing considerably from our own resources. It is important that there should be a financial agreement, but it is even more important that we should avoid a situation where the new Member States are bound hand and foot once again by a multitude of administrative obstacles regarding how funds are spent, because it looks as if that is the direction we are heading in.</p>
<p class="contents">If we need a new agreement, then one of its pillars must be to solidify the enlarged 25-member Union. Over the past decade and a half, we in the ten new Member States have vigorously cleared the hurdles, despite all the difficulties. To invigorate Europe – as Europe seems to need such – all twenty-five of us must strive vigorously for solidity. Over the past year, there has not been much evidence of this. Perhaps now things will change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A great deal has already been said about the reasons for this fiasco. I myself concur fully with the views expressed by President Barroso at the start of the debate, and in particular with his comments on the reasons why no compromise was reached on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with the view that the EU is facing a long-term crisis, and I believe that the deadlock on EU expenditure will soon be broken. At the same time, however, I should like to emphasise most strongly that the new Member States must not suffer as a result. European solidarity must not fall prey to conflicts between the 15 old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We will never achieve dynamic economic growth in Europe if nearly one quarter of the EU’s population is deprived of the substantial support it will need over the next few years to overcome the effects of the political and economic division of Europe that was imposed upon the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. The EU as a whole needs to work together to this end. It is in the vital interests of the richer Member States to invest in the new Member States in order to accelerate their development. A strong cohesion policy and free movement of services provide the best means of achieving this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should also like to pay tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency for having instigated what has been termed a period of reflection in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty. This was a very judicious move, and one that is essential if we are to maintain a healthy European democracy. The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands cannot be ignored without widening the gap between Europe’s elite and its citizens. Those who have called for the ratification process to be continued without any period of reflection, as though nothing had happened, would achieve the very opposite of their intentions. They would forfeit any chance of achieving genuine democratic legitimacy for the European project, perhaps for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that by taking its foot off the accelerator, the Luxembourg Presidency has steered the EU round a dangerous bend as far as this issue is concerned. I should like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Prime Minister Juncker and Mr Schmit for having done so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In retrospect we realise that Mr Schulz was right that we in the Parliament had done our work, the Commission had done its work, but the Council, for reasons of overcharge on its agenda, had not actually done the real thinking on the financial perspective. Therefore, to have completed a deal within the space of two weeks was perhaps a little bit beyond the capacity of the Union. No deal is better than a bad deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we need to look forward and there are four points I will raise quickly. The first is to have a real debate about priorities of the Union. How can you have a financial perspective unless you know what the policy priorities are going to be? Part of that must be the economic reform agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson referred to the UK and France being in Jurassic Park. I think the economies of France and Germany are the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. We have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need to be able to fix a budget deal. Not, as Mr Barroso said, to have a seven year deal with a review. Let us come back to what we said in the Berger resolution and have a five-year deal, allowing the Commission and Parliament to review it in 2011. This way we can see how far we are going without having to predict what our expenditure will be too far into the future. In reconsidering that option we need to do more, as Mr Virrankoski said, on co-financing on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Third – and I include two last points here – we need to look at the question of the Constitutional Treaty. I welcome the suspension of ratification, because there are many things that are needed in terms of transparency, accountability, democracy and inclusion of national parliaments. This will be essential for a Union of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, is the question of enlargement. Mr President-in-Office, what you do not do when you are putting a house in order is put up a new annex and then try to make sure you are still expanding. Let us, as Mr Nassauer said, focus on what is really essential for our European citizens and then think about enlargement, if necessary, a little bit further on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By dint of the fact that Europe has become ambitious, it takes stock and asks itself fundamental questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ambition was to create an inclusive, integrated justice system, characterised by human dignity and capable of setting an example to the world. Europe drew up a Constitutional Treaty that enabled it to break free of the confines of offices and to go out onto the streets. The debate on the European Constitution has, undeniably, seen the greatest democratisation in Europe’s history.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is seeking a public domain characterised by transparency and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, there can be no turning back on this odyssey; Europe is duty bound not to abandon this ambition of political sharing. Furthermore, Europe must not think solely on its own. Without an integrated Europe there is no European model and without a European model we cannot set an example of human dignity around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only through political integration that decision-making can be effective, that our system of values can be placed on firm foundations and that Europe can speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must be proactive and visible in the times ahead; it must work in a network with the national parliaments; political parties, local authorities and citizens’ groups must play their part; and the media must also become involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the European institutions have a responsibility that they must fulfil unflinchingly, given that the European debate is not merely a sum of national debates. The Constitution fits into this process of searching for consensus in an open and fragmented reality. Through the Constitution we have a duty to raise awareness of our shared interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, there are themes that must be addressed: the enlargement and governance; the EU’s financial model; the decision-making process and subsidiarity; integration and social, economic and political pluralism; the Constitution as a driving force or the Constitution as a framework.</p>

<p class="contents">I particularly want to thank the Luxembourg presidency for the fact that, under the leadership of Minister Krecké, it has moved forward with the vital work on the Services Directive. I am delighted that there has been no question of the Luxembourg presidency being intimidated by noises off from certain great figures in European politics about the problems with that directive, of how they have sorted it out, and of how they have killed the directive in some cases. President-in-Office, I have been pleased that you have been as committed to the vital project to complete the internal market as we are on our side, and we will continue to work strongly with the British presidency to bring it to a conclusion and to build on the work that you have done.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I would like to link that point to some of the important remarks that the President-in-Office made this afternoon. I wanted to pick out one aspect where I disagreed with him: he said that one of the choices we are faced with at the moment is between a free market and a stronger political union. I would suggest, colleagues, that is not the choice at all. We have moved far beyond a free market already: an internal market is an entirely different proposition. It is a major political and economic force. Our citizens want and understand that, but I ask those of you still here in the Chamber how many of your electors know what a political union is, and know in what direction it is taking us? Surely one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected so soundly in Holland and France was because people do not understand what a political union is. They actually feel threatened by the potential loss of sovereignty that it implies. Therefore, let us get on with the internal market. We may want to review where the political union goes and the changes we make to the Constitution, but the internal market must continue to be the driving force during the British presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that Europe is experiencing serious difficulties, but I think that these difficulties can help us. First by making us refocus on a more in-depth reflection on the development of this Europe. To an extent, that is what has been decided: a reflection, not behind closed doors, in secret, but a reflection-debate, a reflection-dialogue with the citizens on the path of European integration that we must follow. I think that, if our current difficulties can help us to open those doors, to open that debate, then, in the end, they will have had a purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have referred to the idea that the negative votes were motivated by a number of concerns expressed by the citizens, particularly social concerns or those raised by globalisation. In short, all of that needs to be included in this debate, included in this dialogue with the citizens. We in Luxembourg are taking the risk of holding a debate-election, a debate-referendum: we are the ones who have stuck with the date of 10 July. It is a courageous decision, but it is a decision that was called for by the people of Luxembourg. Well, I have confidence in them and I think that, from that vote on 10 July, a clear message will emerge of continuity with the Constitution. I am confident and I hope that, following that vote, which I hope and pray will be positive, Parliament will take the baton so that the Constitution is not put on ice indefinitely. I myself thought that we had got rid of the ice when we reformed the common agricultural policy, once we no longer had butter mountains. Now, though, I see that we are putting the Constitution and the financial perspectives on ice. No, Europe does not need hibernation, it needs action. Europe needs a clearly marked path.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the time has come to pass on the baton. On the financial perspectives, we could have reached an agreement, and it is extremely regrettable that we did not do so. I think that Mr Juncker gave as transparent a report as Mr Bonde has always hoped for, as transparent as possible. We have spoken a great deal about various aspects of the negotiations. We came within a hair’s breadth of reaching agreement, because we know that, had there been a true current of agreement, those who were rejecting it would have agreed in the end. They did not do so because the current of agreement failed for the reasons of which you are aware. Many reasons have also been put forward not to accept this agreement. I have a bad feeling that, in the end, those reasons are more a pretext than real reasons. If reform becomes a pretext for not adopting important decisions for Europe, this does Europe a disservice. I tell you this, and Mr Juncker has already said it: we were prepared to make, in a declaration, a substantial commitment to reform. Well, that commitment did not see the light of day because, in the end, there was no final decision on the financial perspectives. Reform, yes, but reform in solidarity. We will not have reform without the people. We will not have reform without solidarity with everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural policy was also the target of a great deal of criticism. We forget rather too easily that there are, nevertheless, fundamental achievements in this agricultural policy. Who would wish for the desertification of acres of European countryside? Who wishes for that? Who would wish poverty on the rural population? Who wants that? I think that, once again, we need to debate the agricultural policy and not blame it for every problem, not demonise it, so to speak. I think that, on that subject, some honesty is needed. Primarily, and on this point I think that I am echoing Mr Baringdorf, is everybody really so innocent when we discuss agricultural policy? Does everybody think only of reforming it in one way without thinking about reforming it in another? I think that you will have many more opportunities to discuss reforms, including reform of the common agricultural policy. Do not forget, however, that there is also solidarity with the countryside, which is also a component of European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I obviously regret that Europe has not been able to find the positive dynamic that it could have drawn from the adoption of a better Stability and Growth Pact, and particularly from a revision of the Lisbon Strategy. We have no financial perspectives. I wish the next Presidency luck in reaching an acceptable and balanced agreement – indeed, someone has already mentioned balanced agreements – taking into account Mr Böge’s report which was adopted by a very large majority of your Parliament. Given that the agreement in the Council was an agreement that would, in any event, still have had to be negotiated with your Parliament, it is an illusion to think that the Council alone decides on the financial perspectives, since it is clear that the Council can only reach an agreement within the interinstitutional framework with the assent of your Parliament and, of course, of the Commission too.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about a fair return. I think that it is a virus gnawing away at European solidarity: we must eradicate it. Europe really must be vaccinated against this narrow idea of a fair return.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not talk about the definition of the richest countries – I do not want to get involved in that kind of discussion – but what I have noticed is that there has been a great deal of fiddling with the numbers. There has been much fiddling, in order to justify positions that, if they were explained a little better, would then appear much more qualified.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not want to conclude this assessment of the Luxembourg Presidency without stressing, as Mr Harbour did, that, although there has been a failure with respect to the financial perspectives, there have also been many successes. Europe is continuing to work in other fields of importance to the populations of Europe. I note, for example, that there has been an agreement, thanks in part to your Parliament, on the ‘external borders’ code: this is vital if we are to increase security at our external borders, and I think that your Parliament will vote on it during this part-session. It is a success that we must not minimise and that we must not now drown in an overly negative discussion on the current state of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I note, too, that there have been a dozen approvals at first reading with your Parliament on important matters, such as cross-border mergers, or concerning the internal market. I think that these are important achievements that must not be minimised. The same is true of the approvals at second reading, without recourse to conciliation, in a field such as car insurance, which has a direct effect on citizens who travel and who cross borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Europe is experiencing major difficulties, but I think that a part of its destiny is now also in your hands. We want to open up a debate. That debate must take place here, and it must take place in the national parliaments, within public opinion. I wish you all the courage and all the creativity that you have shown before to feed this debate, so that we can extricate ourselves as quickly as possible from these difficulties.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all I would like to join all those who have expressed their sincere admiration and gratitude to Jean-Claude Juncker, Minister Schmit and their team for their engagement, the passion and what I would like to call the sense of Europe that they have demonstrated. We often talk about the sense of State in relation to great statesmen and women, but it is high time to introduce the concept of a sense of Europe, and this is what Mr Juncker especially has shown throughout the Luxembourg presidency. I would like to add that we also greatly appreciate the transparency and openness that you have introduced, Mr Juncker.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we should also highlight the successes that you have been able to achieve in a highly difficult political context. However, this debate on the Luxembourg presidency has turned into a debate on the European crisis. The most significant expression of this crisis is perhaps the feeling of confusion that we now perceive among the public and in the very basic questions that citizens have started to ask. What will happen to the Constitution? What does it mean if we cannot have a constitution in the end? How will this affect enlargement? Has it already started to affect enlargement? In the different regions of Europe, they have already started to ask very basic questions about the budget. What will happen? Will we get our money? What happens to all our projects?</p>
<p class="contents">May I just say to Mr Harbour and others that we should not underestimate the citizens of Europe. Throughout Europe they know that Europe is not only about a market. It is also about quality of life and they expect the European Union to deliver and to establish policies which affect their quality of life, the environment and all the other issues that are so important for our everyday lives. These are the questions that European citizens will continue to put to all our institutions and it is our joint responsibility to provide the answers, as far as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a unique creation. It works on the basis of this very constructive, or hopefully constructive, interaction of the ‘institutional triangle’. However, the outcome of the European Council this weekend seems to show that one of the corners is somehow broken. That puts a bigger responsibility on the other two corners, the Commission and Parliament, but in this debate I have seen that there is a willingness and determination to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Juncker referred to the institutional maturity that the Parliament has shown. We have seen this, for example, on the occasion of the recent Parliament resolution on the financial perspective. As President Barroso said earlier, the Commission stands ready to assist the incoming presidency to find an agreement on the future financial perspectives. We however have to bear in mind three crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need the resources to implement those policies on which the citizens expect the Union to deliver, and we need the budget for that. A deal that does not secure those resources will not allow us to bridge the gap between citizens and Europe. Second, this House must accept the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it must meet the legitimate needs of the new Member States who have shown their constructive attitude during the summit meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The main challenge for the months to come is the launch of a real dialogue on the future of Europe. The European Council has called for that dialogue in which the Commission is also invited to play a central role.</p>
<p class="contents">We will of course give shape to what we call Plan D: debate, dialogue and democracy. We will work with the other institutions and we will try to mobilise the necessary resources for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will accept its responsibility and we will also immediately start to work on the ‘strategic roadmap’, which will hopefully provide some more of the responses to the very basic questions that I mentioned before.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, more than ever, need the input, cooperation and support of this House and all of those, who like Mr Juncker, have developed the sense of Europe and are ready to respond to his very solemn invitation.</p>

This victory paved the way for combating the increasingly neoliberal guidelines that have gradually been introduced in the EU in recent years, and that have ultimately been enshrined in the draft so-called European Constitution. From a political and legal point of view, the people dealt the Constitutional Treaty a deadly blow in these referenda, given that a Treaty can only enter into force if it has been ratified by all 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council of 16 and 17 June had the evidence staring it in the face, yet it chose to ignore it, preferring instead to admit that it had suffered a setback and to prolong the agony for some more time by giving itself a year to take stock. It will at some point have to acknowledge that this proposal in its current form cannot enter into force, and even in revised form it will be required to undergo the entire ratification process again.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Financial Perspective, the complete absence of a spirit of solidarity is regrettable ...</p>
