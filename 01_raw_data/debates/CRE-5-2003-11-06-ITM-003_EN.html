We are increasing the number of EU Member States, and we are at the moment devising and debating a new framework for treaty-based cooperation based on the nation states and the people.</p>
<p class="contents">There are quite a few prior conditions of involvement in EU cooperation, but one of them is the need to practise democracy and observe human rights, that is to say people must have equal opportunities to develop, and exercise control over, their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at what is actually happening in Europe, who is it that takes the decisions? Who determines the laws? Who manages daily life in international, European, national, regional and local assemblies? Who personifies public power? The answer is quite simply that it is the men who do this. If there is any doubt about this, it is enough to try asking how many women there are among Heads of State or Government. The answer is, none. If we look at the family photo from Copenhagen in 2002, there are 64 people in that picture, including just eight women.</p>
<p class="contents">Is that the case because there is a shortage of women in Europe? Is it a case of our constituting a minority? There are, now and again, people who tell us that we do, whereupon we are placed among other minorities. In that case, we must, however, tell ourselves that, no, this is not the case. We constitute at least half the population. Women form at least half the electorate, so it is not therefore a question of there not being enough women. Is it, therefore, a case of there being no competent women? No, that is not the reason, either. There are in actual fact women – and, as time goes by, more women than men – who enter higher education, although that is no longer, of course, always a criterion for participating in political life. It is not this that forms the background to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are quite a few reasons why there are not enough women, and these apply everywhere. In this case, we shall concentrate on the election we face next year. As has been said, we are at present building the new Europe. Women constitute half the new Europe, and it is absolutely fundamental that this half should also be involved in deciding the framework for, and content of, further cooperation. One of the places in which they can do this is, moreover, in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are in a situation in which 30% of Members of the European Parliament are women. We are now enlarging the EU to include ten new countries and, in that connection, we are obliged to take a brief look at how women are represented in those countries. Unfortunately, matters do not look too good. Obviously, not all the countries are right at the bottom of the table, and the fact is that we also have, among the Member States, countries that are low down on the list where women’s representation is concerned. All the same, we have to say that the average is low. What, therefore, we have to concentrate on in the forthcoming election is getting more women to stand and finding out why others do not wish to do so. Are they in actual fact just not invited to stand, or does the old classic pattern apply whereby no one voluntarily surrenders power, neither men nor women for that matter. Personally, I believe it is the classic situation. Naturally, men do not voluntarily relinquish power, just as we women also find it extremely difficult to give up so-called power over our children. None of us are saints. It is now important, however, for us to try to discuss this matter and to understand that, if we are to have this EU cooperation accepted among the EU’s populations, it would perhaps be a good idea if we were to try inviting women to participate and if, above all, we were to devise systems that might give women opportunities to be elected if they were finally to appear on the lists. Gaining acceptance of EU cooperation will certainly take some doing. Over there sits a Swedish Commissioner and I, who speak now, am a Dane, and if there is anywhere it is hard going obtaining grass-roots acceptance of European cooperation, it is in Sweden and Denmark, with the greatest scepticism among women.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience in the Scandinavian countries shows that it is not, therefore, a case of women not being elected. If they stand on an equal footing, they are in actual fact elected. The fact is that, if there are women who have any chance at all of being elected, then elected they are. It is not therefore a case of voters generally believing women not to be up to scratch. On the contrary, they are happy to vote for them. The truth is that they have no opportunity to vote women representatives in.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that we discuss this matter now because, at present, 31% of MEPs are women. Among the new countries, matters appear lopsided. In a Parliament with greater influence upon European legislation than we have ever had before, we are thus now in danger of having far less than 30% women, because women are so poorly represented in, for example, the new countries. There are two countries that have sent no female observers at all. It really is unbelievable that democracy can be practised and human rights observed on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must all try to help each other ensure that there is a proper proportion of women in the European Parliament so that people feel represented in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am able to concur with it 100%. It was an excellent introduction to what this debate needs to be about.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I naturally wish to congratulate the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and also Mrs Dybkjær as rapporteur, for having taken the initiative regarding this report. This too emphasises the importance of bringing about balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process, especially in the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take democracy seriously and take account of the equality issue in decision-making. If we profess democratic values, the representation of the people and citizens’ active participation, we cannot at the same time exclude half the population from the bodies in which the decisions are taken. Increased participation on the part of women also means better opportunities for society to take care of its citizens. We lose out on both resources and experience if women cannot be a part of political life. Women must be given access to the labour market and to politics in order to be able to advance professionally at a pace commensurate with their qualifications. In that way, proper use will be made of their skills. Unfortunately, it has so far been too often the case that men have been elected. That is something we must change.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in the report, all the Member States have committed themselves to implementing the UN’s action plan from the 1995 Beijing Conference, together with a series of other international programmes in support of the principle of equal participation by women and men in decision-making bodies and in the decision-making process. These constitute the international framework within which we must all work.</p>
<p class="contents">Balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process and in all areas of life is also the central theme of the Commission’s 2003-2004 Work Programme. The work on assessing which projects are to be subsidised from the gender equality programme is in its final phase right now.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to inform you that the Commission is at present developing a database on ‘Women and men in decision-making’. The database is one of a series of measures for developing and maintaining statistics, which are also important as a tool and for providing background information. The preparations for publishing the initial results from this database are currently under way. At the beginning of 2004, the content will be presented on the Commission’s web site. It will then be updated each year. The main aims of the database are firstly to measure progress in relation to the commitments made and, secondly, to bring about increased awareness in the present Member States, the EEA countries and the candidate countries of the situation regarding women and men in decision-making positions.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also mention the measures on decision-making which were recently adopted by the Italian Presidency with the support of the Commission and to which attention is drawn by the report. The Syracuse Conference, together with the subsequent informal meetings between the ministers for equality, emphasised the need to maintain the efforts to achieve balanced representation of women and men in the decision-making processes at all levels. It was also proposed that, by agreement between all the political parties, at least 30% of candidates they appoint to stand for election to the European Parliament should be women. The parties should, moreover, actively strive to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils, particularly those affecting women directly: an employment rate among women of at least 60% by no later than 2010, together with regulations concerning access to good childcare at a reasonable cost. These objectives are also among the tools and basic conditions that will enable women to participate in political life and the life of society generally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know that equality between men and women is a fundamental principle in Community law, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which included equality between men and women as an objective in all programmes. We therefore call for concrete measures to facilitate the presence of women in electoral lists and, therefore, in the European Parliament. In this case, this request could be extended to the other regional or national parliaments in which the representation of women is still low in comparison with the percentage of women, who make up half the population, and in some cases rather more than half the population.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that when there is no special assistance, through positive action measures, with laws to facilitate this great presence of women, we women have real problems accessing institutional posts, political posts and therefore political decision-making posts and positions of power.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had experience over recent years of the presence of women continuing to increase slightly, but in no case has it passed much more than 30% and we are right to fear that in the next European elections it may be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has said, the presence of women amongst the observers coming from the enlargement countries is really low; some countries have not presented women at all as observers, and we fear that, following the elections to the European Parliament, this presence will be no greater than 15%. It is precisely for this reason that it is important and significant that we are stressing this at the moment, and we are not forgetting the countries which currently belong to the European Union, in which the percentage is no greater than 30% in the majority of cases – with the exception of the Nordic countries – and in others that percentage is even lower and women are still facing significant difficulties in terms of accessing decision-making positions.</p>
<p class="contents">They are still significant because there are no electoral laws – with the exception of two countries – laying down the obligation for women to be present on lists and because our ability to be present in decision-making bodies and parliaments depends essentially on the political parties, on the mentality of political leaders and on the awareness we are able to communicate to society on the importance of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore the appropriate time and it is a task which we, as women committed to the presence of women, but also men, and Members of Parliament and political leaders must take on: this challenge of achieving greater presence for women within the political institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the political will of leaders, of parties, when it comes to making decisions, will ensure that there are really more women following the elections and therefore a better balance between men and women in decision-making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the run up to the European elections in June, Mrs Dybkjær's truly exceptional report is of particular value, because it sets the framework within which all the Member States should move, especially the accession countries, in order to ensure that the percentage of women in the House as a result of the European elections should at least be no smaller than it is at present, which is 31%. And I should like to name the two countries, Estonia and Slovenia, which did not bother to send even one woman, even one as an example, with the observers they sent to the European Parliament. Our fears are also reinforced by the traumatic experience we had last year, with 17% participation by women in the constitutional convention for the European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our committee, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has put promoting the democracy of equality at the top of its priorities and has taken initiatives to mobilise governments, national parliaments, political leaders and women themselves in order to achieve this objective, an objective which does not simply concern the application in deed rather than just word of gender equality, but also the financial and social development of Europe through the rational use of the valuable human resource which women represent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy, like other ambitious European policies, urgently needs the full participation of women at all planning and decision-making levels in order to achieve its objectives. The future of Europe cannot be planned in the absence of women. In the run up to the European elections, we need additional strategies and legislative measures, positive action, quotas or political agreements which will safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in electoral combinations and in the elected bodies which result.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the new European Parliament of the 25 will attain this objective and will operate as a shining example and standard for the other parliaments in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come at exactly the right time, just before the European elections, and it has been mentioned here by several speakers already: we will have to do our utmost to match this turnout percentage of 30-31% that was achieved for the European Parliament elections. This is certainly not helped by the accession countries, where we only have 14% at the moment. I therefore believe that in the context of the verification of these countries, we will have to ensure that gender equality forms part of our future fundamental community law, and that we must therefore make sure on an internal level that this is also done in the relevant parliaments. It is all very well pointing the finger at other countries, however; but we also have examples of women being seriously short-changed in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, it was not so long ago that only one female minister was appointed. There was a great deal of protest against this, but fortunately that cabinet soon fell and we now have five female ministers and five female secretaries of state. To my great regret, neither of the two ministers appointed by my own party, which purports to do a great deal for women, is a woman. Not because there are no capable women, but because there are always other people who are more important and who have to take priority. As long as we carry on in this way, women will have no chance. I am also of the opinion, however, that we ourselves must keep hammering on about gender equality and that we must keep a very close eye on it. For example, I would have nothing against following examples like those mentioned in Mrs Dybkjær's report – like in France where party financing depends on the number of women on the list – because we cannot stand still, we must do something. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to pay additional attention to this point in its consultations with all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Wallström said that men elect men. Yes, men in political parties, especially, elect men. They elect men to a greater extent than the electorate does, a fact that is very interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">When women enter politics, the organisation of political work changes, and new issues appear on the political agenda. What is more, women naturally have different political and ideological perceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of last year, we saw the composition of the Convention and the way in which issues of equality were manipulated when it came, among other things, to the legal status assigned to equality. We still see, after many years of decisions to use ‘gender mainstreaming’ as a method in decision-making, that this is completely absent from most areas of politics. It is now also proposed to cut back on the areas of competence of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. This is completely contrary to the trend. It is even a phasing-out of gender equality in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather ironic reading the Council recommendation from December 1996, which stresses that the under-representation of women in decision-making posts leaves their experiences unused and undervalued and thus constitutes a loss for society as a whole. I do in fact agree with the Council recommendation but, when the Council’s own composition throughout the years is examined in the form of photographs shown after the Council meetings, it is seen still to hark back to another era. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all share a concern about how balanced the representation of gender is going to be in the European Parliament in the next legislature. We have a good six months to work hard to dispel this concern and we should not be afraid.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality is one of the European fundamental values which the new Member States have also committed themselves to respecting. There can be no genuine democracy if women are unable to participate in decision-making at all its levels. The fact is that the establishment of pluralist parliamentary democracy does not in itself guarantee equal participation of women and men in political decision-making. We could have rid ourselves of the problem entirely by developing a common European act regarding elections, in which gender equality would be guaranteed. Female politicians have to be made strong professionals in their field with the help of training and financial and moral support. This way the reasons for the lower areas of competency with regard to the women in a quota system compared to their male colleagues would become groundless and fade away.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of an equal society is dimly visible as decision-making without the need for quotas, with the highest decision-making bodies representing the genders equally. It would not seem, however, that we will achieve this without an interim stage, with the EU, the Member States and the political parties actively involved in working jointly on behalf of equality. The political groups should agree common policies to reach a position where in the end equality becomes a reality in economic, political and social life.</p>
<p class="contents">I now want to throw down the gauntlet, as it were, and ask the male Members of the European Parliament here to think about whether they have ever voted for a woman. Furthermore, if you are also influential in your country’s political arena would you propose a woman as President of the Commission? Moreover, if there is an office of President of the EU, who might the woman be whom you would vote for as President? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was elected to Parliament as a representative of an all-party movement, the June Movement, which has now operated for ten years on the principle that we should draw half of all our parliamentary candidates and half of our party’s leading members equally from both sexes. We have just recently prepared a new list of parliamentary candidates, consisting of ten women and ten men, with the vacancies divided on an alternating basis between male and female candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, we had more men than we could make use of and only half the women we needed to have been elected. We therefore began searching through our membership, and we finally obtained the list we wanted and needed. The outcome would, however, have been a lopsided list if we had not adopted regulations committing ourselves to having a list divided equally between both sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome was that gender equality operated to the advantage of the men. Some of the women did in fact obtain more votes at the party conference than some of the men but were listed beneath men with fewer votes because, according to our rule, every other person on the list must be a woman. This outcome was not intended, but I can sincerely recommend all parties to introduce gender equality for all their lists.</p>
<p class="contents">Women consistently hold back, even in those countries that are most advanced in terms of gender equality. Women do not want to put themselves forward unless they feel certain of being on top of everything, ideally more so than their male colleagues. We also know this from job applications. When men apply for a job, some of the many qualifications they reel off have to be discounted. When women apply, qualifications have to be added. That is the way things are, but it is something we can counteract by requiring the same number of candidates from each sex or, as I would prefer, at least 50% women.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as a result, qualified men were deselected in favour of less qualified women, I should not recommend the system, but, in the case of ourselves in the June Movement, the system has operated perfectly at each election, given women the necessary helping hand and provided us with a list that better reflects the electorate. This is, then, an arrangement I should like to recommend to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list. Nine of our candidates are under 40 years old and seven of them under 30 and, what is more, all of them are qualified. Our youngest parliamentary candidate, who is only 18, also has several years’ experience of EU issues. We have no special quota arrangement for young people but have made a conscious effort at renewal so that it is possible to give women and young people a real chance to compete with us old men.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pleasure to be able to contribute a success story from the real world to the debate on equality. In the EU Convention, Mrs Dybkjær and others fought bravely for gender equality but, unfortunately, this was only incorporated into the values of the Danish edition. The other countries’ editions just talk about equality rather than gender equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur's report contains interesting data on the current situation in the Member States and in the European Parliament. It also touches on all the aspects of the problem and makes interesting proposals on dealing with it, proposals which come mainly from the experience of the various countries. I think that promoting exchanges of these experiences is very important because it raises the awareness of the competent agencies, it gives them ideas about applying measures and evaluating progress. The European Commission should, I believe, provide facilities for such action.</p>
<p class="contents">This year is dedicated to the action programme on equal opportunities for women to participate in positions of responsibility. I should like to know if there have already been any results from the application of the programme. However, I suspect that it has nothing interesting or progressive to tell us, because the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations, to which the programme mainly refers, cannot bear fruit if there is no public dialogue in the Member States on the subject which will engage the parliaments, national and regional, where they exist, and will bring parties, local authorities and social agencies face to face with their options and responsibilities, in order to make the whole of society aware of the issue of the participation of women, an issue which concerns the future of the whole of society and not just the future of women. We also need an open dialogue between the parties themselves so that everyone is informed and aware, from the leaders to the regional cadres, of the deficit in the participation of women and the need to apply a strategy to support and promote women cadres to positions of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say, in the run up to the European elections, that we need to raise the awareness of and inform women as citizens and voters about the meaning of these elections and their importance. Plebiscites and referenda, where they have been held, tell us that women are the citizens most distanced from the issues of European policy and the most Euro-sceptical citizens. This is a challenge which concerns us all, at both European and national level, and the European elections give us an opportunity to demonstrate our determination to face up to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At last these matters are being talked about. We can only congratulate our fellow MEP, Mrs Dybkjær, who emphasises the wide-ranging importance that the change in attitudes to integrating women into political life on an equal basis with men may have for the entirety of the social and political contracts we have with our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is acknowledged that positive action is crucial if the balanced representation of women and men is to be achieved. It is acknowledged that involving both sexes in policy development improves policy and makes it more relevant to a varied population. The transparently weak representation of women in the decision-making process raises the problem of the legitimacy of the political structures, for the operation of a democratic system reflects the society it advocates or defends. Equality is a European value, which the Member States must respect. We cannot sustain this incoherence on the eve of enlargement when we wish to maintain, and even enhance, the representation of women in a House, which must spearhead this new trend and, at the same time, be the crucible that enables new behaviours and new strategies to be imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is to be possible, and not only desirable, we need from now on to act in such a way that the 2004 campaign affirms and brings to fruition the principle of effective democracy in which both sexes are represented, for the slightest decline in our representation would be a signal that might be misinterpreted on the eve of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We still have a long way to go even in this Parliament, where one third of us are women, and the best performing country, Sweden, has recently gone from 40% to 45%; still not parity, although we all envy Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress in Belgium, going from 11% to 23%. The new countries could learn something from this, as we have put a lot of effort into achieving it. If we leave it to the goodwill of, let us say, men, nothing will change. If we leave it to a change of mentality, then we could still be having this discussion when our great-granddaughters are MEPs. We must make the effort ourselves, and that applies just as much to the new countries. None of these countries reaches the 30% mark which we are already used to here. Only three countries have more than 20% representation by women. Only 14% of their representatives in this Parliament are women. If we have 100 new members of Parliament, then in the worst-case scenario, if the same ratio applies, we will have 86 men and 14 women. This is a general regression for women in the European Parliament. It should not be the case that the accession countries help our Parliament to become even more male-dominated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we in the European Parliament want to give firm support to all women and to all governments who want to change things for the better, because nothing will happen without voluntary action. The quotas are often criticised for not being justified, for having to leave everything to the spontaneous evolution of democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, we are lawmakers, and a lawmaker knows very well that you cannot leave everything to spontaneous evolution and that action is required. The countries where the best results have been achieved have been those governments which have amended their legislation. Let me quote you the example of Belgium, where it is not permitted to have three candidates of the same gender at the top of the European list.</p>
<p class="contents">We want an equal number of candidates to be put forward now too, and I hope that the excellent recommendations made in this report will be adopted by governments. I expect the Commission to introduce an initiative, I expect initiatives to be introduced by the Council, so that equality in this Parliament, both <span class="italic">de jure </span>and <span class="italic">de facto,</span> does not decrease but improve after accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunately true that, as I look around now, there are noticeably few women here, particularly young women and women with families. As many have commented, in the light of statistics the situation seems even more alarming than before with regard to next year’s elections after enlargement. The proportion of women working in the national parliaments in the new Member States is not more than 30% at best and in more than half of the new Member States the proportion of women members of parliament hovers around the 10% mark. We must nevertheless remember that things could also be better in the current Member States, including my own country, Finland, although Finland can be considered one of the pioneers of equality between women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are women not being voted for, then, if more than half of the electorate are women? The report identifies constituency parties and the selection mechanisms as the main reasons for the under-representation of women. Systems like the Finnish election procedure have guaranteed an equal representation of women and men. Here in the European Parliament almost half the Finnish delegation are women, so there is probably nothing wrong with the system. Instead of parties employing long and hierarchical systems of listing names, in the Finnish election system you vote for both the candidate and the party, and in practice the European Parliamentary elections have been to a large extent about electing an individual, with candidates given priority over parties, which stay very much in the background. In these conditions women have done well. Of course traditions and election culture also have an influential role to play. It nevertheless shows that women are voted for if they simply stand for election.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, however, are young women in particular not interested in politics? Why are women not encouraged to participate in the wielding of power to a greater extent? These I think are questions that furthermore give cause for introspection. Why is the EU not interesting? Women often see EU decision-making as too distant, abstract and highfalutin. Women are workaday heroines who like to stick to more concrete things. The work situation is often difficult, especially for women with families.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have come to realise, whilst expecting my first child, how hard it has been to combine motherhood with the career of a Member of Parliament. The EU’s rules on maternity leave directly oppress young women. Maternity leave is not really a familiar concept and, for example, in Parliament it is put on a par with absence through sickness. There is much room for improvement in this matter and the situation is reflected in the situation regarding employment in Europe as a whole. Women are not sufficiently encouraged to establish a career and start a family. The result is that many women deliberately put off having children. The message coming from the EU should not be either career or motherhood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We take pride in the 30% of Members of this House who are women. If we had 50%, that would be parity. We content ourselves with only 30%, or tell ourselves that we have made progress because we have done very well in comparison with other countries. What this means is that, for a century, we have been progressing one millimetre at a time, and that what we have achieved is far from being secure. When I say that there is the danger of us sustaining more setbacks in this area, I am not just referring yet again to the new Member States, but also to the present ones, which have to make enormous efforts to get that sort of quota into this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, when the progress reports were presented, I heard not one word said about the under-representation of women. This is something else that we should take into account and incorporate into progress reports of this kind, enabling them to show what is lacking and where changes still have to be made where equal opportunities policy is concerned. If we say there is a lack of women candidates – something of which we are very often accused – then we have to give some thought to how women are supposed to combine career, family and politics when they are constantly, too, having their consciences pricked by questions like: how can you do this, that, and the other, as well? This, I think, is where society has a part to play, and this is where there must be consequences for those Member States that fail to do what they have undertaken to do, namely create really equal opportunities. I find myself wondering what mechanisms there are and what are the consequences when they fail to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission must accept its responsibility. I am aware that my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou is right now investigating the possibility of organising round-table discussions in the Member States and the candidate countries in order to discuss the issue of gender equality. I believe that these discussions must cover everything from nominations to the way in which subsidies and forms of support might be designed to enable us also to promote gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, there is, of course, also a very important role for the political parties, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations. They must work closely together on improving women’s representation. In the run-up to the European Parliament elections, it is quite clearly an important task to ensure that we maintain, and ideally increase, women’s representation. All the contributions have also made it clear that the new Member States too must be made aware of this, if we are to ensure that women are well represented right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue that, for better or for worse, we shall have to live with for a long time to come, for we unfortunately live at a time when it is easier to split an atom than to overturn a prejudice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
