<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mikołaj Dowgielewicz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, may I remind you and the House, as I mentioned in the first debate we had this afternoon, that the High Representative is actually in the region at the moment, ahead of the UN General Assembly next week.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of important developments in the Middle East since High Representative Ashton briefed you on 6 July. The Quartet meeting in Washington on 11 July, which was held on her initiative, was an important step in this regard. It confirmed the central role that is being played by the Quartet in bringing international legitimacy to the process. It was a constructive meeting where a substantial discussion was held on how to bring the parties back to the negotiating table. It was emphasised by all that the over-riding objective is the resumption of negotiations. The parties need to be committed to a meaningful process that will produce results. Unfortunately the conditions remain such that this has not yet been possible, but all Quartet members are striving to achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the weeks that followed that meeting the High Representative ensured that the momentum was retained, both in contacts with the Quartet partners as well as with the parties. To this end, on 27 to 29 August, the High Representative once again visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Her visit, the latest in a series to the region this year, was aimed at once again demonstrating her commitment, and that of the EU, to the peace process and continuing her efforts to help the parties resume negotiations. This was a message she reiterated in her meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Ministers Barak and Lieberman, as well as with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. She also wanted to express the unity of the EU in its approach, as well as its openness towards any ideas and opportunities that may be helpful to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly argued that the changes that have been witnessed in the neighbourhood, including changes in the countries around Israel, add urgency to the need to find a solution that will enable the people of Israel and the people of Palestine to live in peace and security together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is useful to recall that the EU has adopted a comprehensive position on the parameters on which it considers that negotiations should be based. This is not an attempt by the EU to establish pre-conditions, but rather a framework to allow meaningful negotiations to resume. In fact, a basic tenet of the EU position is that it would be able to accept any agreement that is reached freely by the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you will be familiar with this position, I think that it would be useful to briefly outline these elements once again. They are: an agreement on the borders of the two states that is based on 4 June 1967 lines, with equivalent land swaps as may be agreed between the parties; secondly, security arrangements that, for Palestinians, respect their sovereignty and show that the occupation is over and, for Israelis, protect their security, prevent the resurgence of terrorism and deal effectively with new and emerging threats; thirdly, a just, fair and agreed solution to the refugee question; fourthly, fulfilment of the aspirations of both parties for Jerusalem. A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course you will be aware that the Palestinians, with the support of the Arab Group, have declared their intention of taking up the issue of their status at the United Nations. The EU’s consistent position has been, and remains, that all efforts should focus on the resumption of negotiations. We will base our reaction to any resolution on two basic elements.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is crucial that we maintain the unity that has characterised EU efforts on the Peace Process over the past months. It is clear that this has strengthened our position. The second factor is that any initiative at the UN should be constructive and aimed at achieving a return to negotiations. If this is the case, we should be prepared to engage and to contribute in any way that we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Those basic elements were thoroughly discussed during the informal Gymnich meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Sopot, Poland, on 2 to 3 September, which the High Representative also briefed on her visit to the region. Of course the ministers took this opportunity to exchange views on the various aspects presented by this situation, even though there is no proposal as yet. While it might be tempting to speculate over the repercussions of the various scenarios, it would be more prudent to react to a solid proposal. There was solid agreement on the fact that EU unity is crucial. Ministers reiterated their support for the High Representative’s efforts and gave their backing to her endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Gymnich meeting, the High Representative has remained in constant contact with all the parties involved in this issue. She has decided, before going to New York for the UN General Assembly, to have another round of discussions in Cairo – taking advantage of a special meeting of the Arab League – and in Israel, where she is now. With all her different interlocutors she has reaffirmed the urgency of relaunching the peace negotiations and underlined the need to find a way out of the present stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the many difficulties that remain, the EU can still play a useful role in bridging the gap between the different partners and helping to define a possible compromise. The High Representative has every intention of upholding the EU’s responsibilities at this crucial moment for the whole Middle East. No-one can doubt that the process of reaching a compromise is going to be very complicated, but the EU cannot renounce what many have described as its moral obligation to strive for peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of how matters evolve, I must express concern at the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority. The EU and Member States remain committed contributors, but the situation is critical. Other donors have not yet fulfilled their pledges; we should make every effort to encourage them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is on record as having recognised that the Palestinian institutions have achieved a level of preparedness that is sufficient to support the obligations of statehood. This is the result of the vision and very hard work of Palestinian leaders, who have been able to accomplish this with a great deal of support and expertise provided by the EU, among others. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that what has been achieved will not be needlessly lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue can be approached from an outside perspective – any implications that the outcome of the General Assembly might have on the peace process, and any change to the status quo, count a great deal – and from the perspective of the internal dimension of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the external perspective, the peace process is in deadlock, as Mr Dowgielewicz has just told us. We are seeing increased tension in the region – the most tangible evidence of that was the attack on the Israeli embassy in Egypt – and also very particular circumstances for the United States government. President Obama is going to have difficulty meeting the proposals he set out in his inaugural speech in Cairo, because of the situation within the United States and also as a result of the electoral process he will soon have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in politics anything that is not possible is false; without wishing to prejudge the substance of the resolution that is going to be adopted, I believe that we should start getting ready to adopt a draft resolution that improves the status of Palestine within the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me on to the internal dimension of this issue: it is vital that the EU can express itself in a united voice on this sensitive point. Our past experiences in the United Nations have not been glorious. To be sure, we have shifted position in light of the new mechanisms established by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I believe that we need to focus all our efforts on three objectives: the peace process must move forward, and the status quo of a lack of negotiations must end; the chances to move forward on this issue must not be compromised or endangered; and the dignity of both parties in this conflict must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on this point I feel that the EU’s greatest strength is its union, and its greatest weakness is its division. I would therefore ask Mr Dowgielewicz – I realise, of course, that the Commissioner and Baroness Ashton are doing all they can on the matter – to ensure that the European Union faces this sensitive issue without showing its customary division, and appears united by making a positive, active contribution to the progress that needs to be made in this conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This marks an historic moment that leaves us Europeans with our back to the wall – which is more than just a figure of speech in the case of Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">In honouring the commitment made to recognise the State of Israel in 1948, Europe has consistently supported a two-State solution based on the 1967 border, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States. It has not just said this, as in the Council Conclusions of December 2009. It has helped to build Palestinian institutions, not least by financing the Fayyad plan which, after two years, has succeeded in creating credible Palestinian institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has therefore come to take the next step, the diplomatic step of supporting Palestine’s request in the UN. The Palestinians deserve this support, the Palestinians have a right to this support, the Palestinians believe in this support.</p>
<p class="contents">Some will say that the United States is not in favour. Can Europe do nothing more than meekly echo the United States? Since his famous speech in Cairo, President Obama has been back-pedalling and has been bogged down by the prospect of a second term. Forget the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Some will say that nothing will change on the ground. They are right. It is true that we need to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. Bolstered by their rights and the recognition of their State, the Palestinians must come back to the negotiating table, but they must do so on a far more equal footing, with new rights and new responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Others will say, and indeed have said, that there is a danger that we will become divided. Whose fault is that? It is our fault, the fault of the European Parliament, because we are the voice of the people, not of the governments. An article in <span class="italic">Haaretz</span> indicated that most people are in favour of a Palestinian state. We have a duty to help our governments to speak with one voice, to take a bold political stance, but also an ethical stance, because this problem aside, Europe’s entire credibility with regard to the Arab Spring is at stake. We support Libya, we support Tunisia, we support Egypt and we deplore the suffering in Syria. Yet the UN represents the Palestinians’ Arab Spring: it is a peaceful solution, it is the way of negotiation and the diplomatic route that is being pursued in the UN. We need to support that, otherwise the Middle East will find itself plunging back into violence in the days ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an historic duty today, a duty to establish peace in the Middle East. This is an opportunity, and it must be seized on. That is my group’s message to you today.</p>

The demand for UN recognition comes with duties and obligations, as well as the possibility of accession to the International Court of Justice and to certain treaties. As a result, this puts the two sides on something of an equal footing in the negotiations. Furthermore, it places the negotiations within a multilateral framework.

You would think that you never have the chance to talk to each other. Still, we have learnt a lot during this short exchange of views.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I am going to express a position that is – I believe – held by a majority in my group but is not necessarily shared by every single one of its members. Honesty dictates that I say so.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank Mr Dowgielewicz – I apologise if I pronounced your name incorrectly – for having explained to us very clearly – at least for those who are familiar with the issue – where we are at and what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">You rightly mentioned the Quartet meeting held on 6 July, during which it was decided that everything should be done to resume the negotiations which, since then, have not resumed at all. That is the very least that should happen. We are now faced with a potential Palestinian initiative and – if I am right about what is happening at the moment – with all-out negotiations aimed at shaping this demand by the Palestinian Authority so that it brings about the greatest possible unity among the Member States of the Union. This is an effort that we support and that we hope will bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">However I also wish to be clear, ladies and gentlemen: for my part, and for many of my colleagues, if ever this effort were to fail, if ever the United Nations General Assembly were to consider a formal demand for recognition of the Palestinian Authority as a sovereign State, I very much hope that the majority of the Member States of the Union – if not all – would continue to support the clear position they have upheld since the end of last year, the full details of which, President-in-Office of the Council, you have, in fact, discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Because it must be very clear – and I will end here – that we cannot and should not ask the Palestinians to pay the price of the European Union’s unity. It is up to us, not them, to take on that responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone saw it coming, and still we have no answer to it. By ‘answer’ I mean direct negotiations. The Palestinians have a right to their own state, and international organisations, not only the World Bank, have confirmed that the efforts they have made were successful. As regards the question of membership there is no simple ‘no’ – absolutely not – nor is there a simple ‘yes’.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the current situation. At the UN General Assembly a resolution will probably be adopted supporting a raising of the status, similar to that with regard to the Vatican. I very much hope that all the European States at least can vote ‘yes’ to this. Of course, it depends very much on the text and on the substance of this text. The EU is called on here to use its power. However, it is clear that that will only work if the 27 Member States speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot quite understand what you mean when you say that we are waiting to see what sort of text we get. It is up to us what sort of text is produced. That is our task, the task of the 27 – that is our strength. The Americans will not be able to do it. They have stepped back. We Europeans are called on to word the text in such a way that all 27 can agree on it and so that we will have a large majority in favour of it in the United Nations. In order for this text to be acceptable to many, it should, in my opinion, contain four points. Firstly: </p>
<p class="contents">a clear statement on supporting Israel alongside a Palestinian state, its legitimacy and permanence. Secondly, parameters that address certain Israeli concerns about previous resolutions, such as 181. Thirdly, a separate clarification and reiteration by Europe of its commitment to Israel’s security. Lastly, I think there should be a possible timetable for membership which should be outlined in such a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is obvious. However, we seem to forget too often that the EU in particular should pay special attention to the religious liberties of all the minorities living in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to state that we need to exhibit particular sensitivity in relation to areas where huge, ground-breaking political changes are taking place. The most persecuted group of all are, of course, the Christians, who have lived there for hundreds, sometimes thousands of years, and in spite of this the radical wing of Islam is seeking to remove them from society. In Iraq, for example, Christians cannot manage their own schools, build churches or publish books. They are second-class citizens in their own country. This is part of a programme of religious cleansing imposed on the whole region by radicals. Religious freedom is interpreted throughout the region with reference to sharia law as freedom to pray in private. This is not consistent with the spirit of religious freedom in international law which permits the freedom to convert and to build churches, and allows religious publishing and education.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that our diplomats not forget the religious freedom of Christians in the Middle East, including the places we have discussed today, in everything we do in that part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Palestinians are making this move following laborious efforts to discharge their obligations towards the Quartet, because they believe that recognition of their State by that international organisation will kick start negotiations with Israel, which have been completely deadlocked for some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the Quartet, which includes the European Union, undertook to find a two-state solution by September 2011. One state, Israel, exists. The other was built by the Palestinians, by completing Prime Minister Fayat’s programme. Now this state is waiting for the international recognition it deserves, in the hope that, as a recognised state in the international community, it will sit at the negotiating table on equal terms with Israel in order to find a sustainable solution to the problem between them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to talks to resolve the political question, upgrading the status of the Palestinians would help to resolve other individual – but important – issues, such as security, the utilisation of water resources, the refugee question and the status of Jerusalem. The stated position of the European Union is that it supports the Palestinians’ request, but that it needs to be put forward, as they say, at the right time.

As a co-signatory to the Oslo II Accords, the European Union committed itself to the negotiation process for the parties to the Middle Eastern conflict. My question is: why are the EU Member States now hesitating to speak out, jointly, promptly and clearly, on the basis of this clear international obligation, against an open violation of the Accords by one of the signatories? And that is even without mentioning those Member States which, according to press reports, have in various ways more or less rallied behind the Palestinian plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to know from the Council what the European Union thinks about the announcement by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Mahmud Abbas, that he intends, in the event of Palestinian success at the United Nations, to use the international upgrade of Palestine’s status against Israel with the help of UN agencies, such as the International Criminal Court. I very much doubt that that will really help to establish the peace in the Middle East which we long to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw both the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the alarming verbal aggression of the Turkish dignitaries, who are raising tensions in the Middle East. What do the Council and the Commission think of the Turkish rejection of the legality of the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip? See the UN or the Palmer report. What do they think of Prime Minister Erdogan’s announcement – or should that be ‘threat’ - of an increased Turkish navy presence in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean? We are talking here about a reckless action by a European Union candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">What was particularly distressing to my ears was Prime Minister Erdogan’s assertion that the Israelis interpret any criticism as anti-Semitic. Let us bear in mind that this very Turkish prime minister is failing to squarely confront and tackle the hate speech and anti-Semitism in his national media. You cannot be proud of a country where anti-Semitism is routine, can you? That is what a representative of the Jewish minority in Turkey told me in a telephone conversation. When the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs speaks in one breath of the Arab Spring and an Israeli Autumn, can we still talk of the peace process and the Turkish contribution? That is a deeply sad state of affairs. I hope that the Council and the Commission will declare where they stand on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR 1 billion a year to a corrupt regime that does very little for its own people, while ordinary voters in our countries are crushed by rising taxes and inflation. It is unreal.</p>
<p class="contents">Worse than that, EU policy is based on the false concept that a two-state solution is workable. It might have been once, but it is too late now. The Palestinians are geographically dispersed: over two million live east of the 1947 armistice lines, a million in Gaza, and about a million in Israel. In the Occupied Territories, the illegal Zionist settlement programme has sliced their land into disjointed parcels.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if all the territories conquered in 1967 were included, Palestine would still be only 22% of the territory of the current Greater Israel. It would be an economic basket case, forever reliant on foreign aid handouts. The two-state solution sounds pretty, but it is simply not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, the EU is throwing money away on a policy doomed to failure. We must accept that we cannot solve every problem in the world. We should turn our attention and money to solving our own. Let us face it: thanks to the euro disaster, this place is not going to run out of problems. EU meddling in the Holy Land is not only stealing money from overtaxed British families; combined with even more massive US aid for Israel it encourages both sides to refuse to get serious about sorting out their own differences. None of it helps real people. It is a counterproductive waste of EUR 1 billion a year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is divided over whether or not to grant that request in the short term. However, there is something to be gained from this, because we are agreed on a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as a shared capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the Palestinians very well. I understand their desire for rapid recognition, because negotiations have proved impossible. Not only are there too many settlements, but also the Israelis simply continue to build them, despite all requests that they refrain. That means that, even if a Palestinian state is recognised at the end of the negotiations, before long this state will be a patchwork of Palestinian and Israeli territories that will no longer be governable and will therefore lose the right to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that Mr Abbas can soon return home with something good to tell his people. We cannot allow him to leave empty-handed. We Europeans must ensure that there is a compromise, a solution. Indeed, we have to improve the status of the Palestinians. Israel stands completely isolated in the Middle East at the moment – and not even Mr Belder can deny that. That is painful to acknowledge, it is very painful, it is certainly painful to me, as someone who was brought up to be a right-minded European with a great deal of sympathy for the Promised Land. However, we have to recognise that patience is running thin and that something really has to be done now. The current situation is untenable and that is why a compromise between the Europeans is much needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members do not need me to rehearse the conflicts that are under way and those bubbling under the surface. The Arab Spring and its potential for a great leap forward can only be fully realised when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and occupation is resolved. In this regard, Europe has to be consistent if we are to retain any shred of credibility with those who are struggling to construct a better way of governing themselves and providing a better life for their children. We all know that a negotiated two-state solution is the optimum solution. Palestinians decided over 20 years ago to accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 Green Line – 22% of their historic homeland – with Jerusalem as a shared capital with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this historic compromise, Israel’s current leadership refuses to engage, demanding negotiations without Palestinian preconditions, while laying down its own preconditions, such as continued colonisation of Palestinian land, and rejecting President Obama’s basis for negotiations. President Abbas therefore has no option but to make a broad appeal to the international community, through the United Nations, in order to maintain his non-violent, political and diplomatic strategy for an end to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">All EU Member States support the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines, and we have agreed that the PA is ready for statehood, so no major principle is involved. By voting for an upgrading of the state of Palestine in the United Nations, we will, however, reinforce the non-violent strategy of President Abbas. To do otherwise will shred our reputation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the European External Action Service to strain every sinew to negotiate a resolution with the Palestinians which unites EU Member States in support of President Abbas’s initiative, which reassures both Palestinians and Israelis regarding their core concerns, and which seeks to create the potential for revived, time-limited final status negotiations. That could possibly stop the clock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is our deep friendship with the Palestinian people, a people that is suffering, that suffers every day. One has to visit the occupied territories to see the daily suffering of the Palestinian people, and this is a people to whom the international community owes a debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The second certainty is the tie that binds us to Israel as Europeans, a tie that is probably stronger than that with any other country outside the EU, because Israel is an indispensable part of Europe’s cultural and moral identity; it is part of our family.</p>
<p class="contents">The third certainty, unfortunately, is that Europe is always divided or highly conservative in its positions. These limitations are clear also in this vote at the United Nations, which will probably be another mortifying occasion after the absence of any European policy to speak of in the Libyan crisis, and yet it is only up to us, Minister, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens are finally asking for a qualitative leap, a position from Europe as a whole and, if possible, I hope there will be a position in support of the declaration of independence, as many Israelis too are asking, contrary to their government, and as Palestinians are asking from a basic sense of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for independence would first of all be in line with the reality of the Palestine that there is, that exists despite everything, and that no one can cancel from the maps. Its identity paradoxically grows stronger in the national sentiment with every day that passes, thanks to the occupation. In second place the security and the very identity of Israel would be strengthened. This security and identity are guaranteed more by the existence of two separate States with clear borders than by the prospect – and this is something we should ask the Israeli leaders in 20 years’ time – of a single State shared by Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this declaration of independence would be a break with the stagnant waters of European diplomacy and the negotiations that are going nowhere. If we fail to embrace this break then we are condemning ourselves, after the financial crisis, to remaining on the sidelines also of international diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe is dithering at a time when it should be adopting an independent position and asserting itself as a player on the international stage. According to a very recent poll, the majority of French, German and British citizens think that the Palestinians have the right to a State that should be recognised by the UN immediately. The fact is, we represent the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic awakening of the Arab world creates a new context which is likely to relaunch the peace process. The aspirations of young people are the same in Tunis, Cairo, Ramallah and Gaza. If we abandon the Palestinians, despair could lead to a new intifada, for which we would be responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact a historic opportunity that is being presented to the European Union. It should include the recognition of this Palestinian state in its policy of support for the Arab Spring, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian Authority to force it to abandon its claim to fully fledged statehood at the UN, and instead of working on the Israeli Government so that it finally agrees to respect international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Palestinian Authority has threatened the UN with dire consequences if it does not proclaim a Palestinian state next week. I do not believe that such a one-sided step will bring us any closer to a peaceful solution. Quite the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is one of the largest of the Palestinian Authority’s financial backers and Europe should use this instrument to force Mr Abbas to return to the negotiating table. Solutions to the process can only be found at the negotiating table and that requires efforts from all parties. That call is now especially pertinent for the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor which is certainly posing an equally great threat to peace in the Middle East at the moment is the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan. He wants to restore the Ottoman Empire and is increasing the sabre-rattling. He is threatening to use Turkish warships to break the legitimate sea blockade of the Gaza Strip. The UN was right when it said that, above all, Turkey should have prevented the Gaza flotilla from setting sail. The Turkish Government failed to do that. Mr Erdogan is now trying to paper over this failure by threatening Israel and pushing the agenda for a Palestinian state. This man is clearly a risk to peace in the Middle East. That is one more reason not to take him seriously as a partner in negotiations and to call a definitive halt to Turkey’s accession to the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, whichever way the vote goes, their suffering will continue. There have been hundreds of resolutions, many condemning Israeli aggression and resolutions recognising and supporting an independent Palestinian state at the UN. Successive Israeli governments have simply ignored them. What I think is needed to bring about change is mass action, a third intifada by the Palestinian people against the blockade of Gaza, against roadblocks, against the apartheid wall, against incursions by the Israeli army and against the occupation itself. In recent months, there has been a magnificent movement in Israel with young people – working class people – participating in a social movement demanding social justice. 450 000 people demonstrated two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would put forward that this movement should also take up the question of the oppression of their Palestinian brothers and sisters. Such a development would open up the prospect of forging a powerful alliance of the Palestinian masses and the Israeli workers fighting together against their common enemy, the Israeli establishment, fighting for socialist change in the region, a socialist Israel and a socialist Palestine.</p>

The difference of opinion merely lies in understanding how to achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority’s intention of unilaterally applying to the United Nations for recognition as a state is an initiative which, in my opinion, could harm the peace process and spark off chain reactions in the Middle East. There is clearly an intention to isolate Israel in a diplomatic sense and to present it with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, right at a time when the peace agreements with Egypt are threatened by extremist positions and relations with Turkey are in crisis. The episode of the attack on the Israeli embassy in Cairo is the latest link in this chain.</p>
<p class="contents">The unilateral initiative by the Palestinians is in conflict with the principle shared by both parties, according to which the only solution to the conflict is bilateral negotiations between the parties. Unilateral recognition could therefore create further instability and make it even more difficult to build a democratic Palestinian state that could live in peace with Israel. I therefore hope that there will be a return to the key principles of the Oslo Accords, based on mutual recognition, peaceful coexistence, security and political rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In essence, it is about dignity. That is also what it is about where Israel and Palestine are concerned. Therefore, we are in a favour of Israel and Palestine living together peacefully as two states, each within its own secure borders. We defend the security of Israel against any form of terrorism, but it is also true that the long-term security of Israel will be endangered if Palestine is denied its own state. In other words, the security of Israel will in future only be guaranteed if it has a Palestinian state next door.</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing would certainly be for the negotiations to result in the recognition of Palestine as a state in the UN. However, there is one prerequisite for this. According to a report from the Israeli non-governmental organisation Peace Now, Israel has built twice as many houses in the Palestinian territories since the end of the settlement freeze in October 2010 as it has in Israeli territory. In other words, it is taking away from the Palestinians the land that will form the basis of a Palestinian state. That is not only unlawful, it is also sending Israel further into isolation, because Israel’s settlement policy towards Palestine is illegitimate. Therefore, if Israel does not declare a settlement freeze, there is no other option, in my opinion, than for Palestine to be recognised in the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are peace-loving people, and Israel will once again regret it if it does not make peace with these people. Let us not harm the Palestinian soul. Let us not violate the dignity of the Palestinian people. Therefore, let us have Israel within secure borders and Palestine within secure borders. The Palestinians are worthy of the same dignity as the Israelis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is because I believe that this cause is just that I also think that a solution for the Middle East urgently requires the negotiations to start up again.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we do know, at least since the Oslo Accords, is that unilateral action has never ever helped the peace talks to move forward. Moreover, the mediators in this conflict – the Quartet and the Council – are very much confirming that this is the case. Just yesterday in Cairo, Baroness Ashton pointed out that the European Union considers the negotiations to be the way forward, and this was reiterated by our Council representative in his opening remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Already I hear some of my colleagues, like many Member States, unreservedly supporting this Palestinian initiative in principle, even though there is no framework, text or plan on the table at present. In other words, a kind of blank cheque is being given to an ‘Operation Palestine’, a ‘United Palestine’ I should say in passing, which does not match the reality on the ground, where enemy brothers are reconciled, but – to cut a long story short – are reconciled in appearance only.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, my fear is that unilateral action will permanently paralyse the negotiations by eliminating any room for compromise and by freezing the non-negotiated red lines, on which the Palestinian leaders will no longer be willing or able to move an inch. I fear this unilateral action turning into sterile diplomatic clashes, as the French Foreign Affairs Minister pointed out recently. There is no common European position at present precisely because there is no text – and I concur with Ms De Keyser and all the other speakers who have said the same – nor resolution, with only a few days left until the expected announcement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am convinced that everything will hinge on this text, on what the Europeans will convince the Palestinians to include in it, but also not to include in it. This just shows the influence that the European Union can and should have, provided it sings from the same hymn sheet of course. It also shows how difficult and ambitious our task is.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current state of affairs and with nothing on the table, I can only hope that this very belated text will enable the European Union to truly play its role, because I believe in a two-state solution, a negotiated solution, because I believe first and foremost in dialogue – I shall conclude, Mr President – a difficult dialogue, certainly, punctuated with agonising but necessary conflicts, particularly over the settlements.</p>

I, therefore, view the question which the Palestinian Authority has raised as a last-ditch attempt to break the deadlock. Because even after recognition, which would obviously be hugely important on a symbolic level, the negotiations would still have to continue. The only difference is that then the two parties would be more equal than they are now.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is of the utmost importance that the international community does not show any signs of division. The European Union should focus all its efforts on this. However, what can we say about the position of the United States and President Obama? Last year, he called on the General Assembly to recognise an independent Palestine, but is now threatening them with a blockade. However, I also find the position of the High Representative highly ambiguous, because we hear that she is trying to convince the Palestinian Authority to abandon the initiative. I wonder, though, whether this is being done to try to disguise the internal division in the European Union? The European Union must use its right to speak to send out a strong common signal in the United Nations, because we need a breakthrough now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring to Camp Ashraf in Northern Iraq, home for the past quarter of a century to more than 3 400 Iranian dissidents who, as you know, have suffered from repeated attacks and harassment by the Iraqi authorities, culminating in a massacre on 8 April this year when 36 of them – unarmed civilians – were killed in cold blood.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know Commissioner, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has given the camp’s residents a deadline of 31 December this year to clear Ashraf. The clock is now ticking rapidly and although we have brokered a plan within the EU for resettling the residents to third countries, and some EU Member States – and even some countries outside the EU – have already started taking some of these refugees, we are running out of time and we are facing the prospect of another violent attack and bloodshed perhaps on a scale similar to Srebrenica.</p>
<p class="contents">I received information last night from UNHCR that the residents of Ashraf are protected under international law, but can I urge the Commission to follow the example of UN High Commissioner António Guterres and write to Nouri al-Maliki demanding an extension of the deadline to give us time to work on the resettlement plan, and in the meantime to provide some protection by getting a UN presence in Camp Ashraf. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, there is not. The European Union, like most of the international community, has repeatedly declared itself to be in favour of the existence of two peoples and two states, sharing the space between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and having the right to live in peace and security. However, without any dialogue between the parties, who have become entrenched in a mire of hatred and incomprehension which has lasted for 63 years, this has fuelled only extremism and frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that Europe and the Arab League become much more engaged in the search for a solution, through negotiation, for borders based on those of 1967, while allowing the majority of the Jewish settlements to remain in Israel. The issue of Jerusalem, a sacred city and the future capital of the two states, should be clarified and mutually accepted as a symbol of peaceful coexistence between two peoples who have an obligation to fulfil the prophecy of Isaiah, which describes this as a land of milk and honey. All the countries of the region should participate in resolving the issue of the Palestinian refugees, while the international community and, in particular, Arab peoples, should share the burden of the necessary financial compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also absolutely essential that a military force, under the auspices of the United Nations (UN) and including US and Islamic forces, among others, be stationed on the ground to ensure that peace is maintained.

However, one thing is clear. Long-term peace and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians will only be achieved by means of an agreement. Therefore, both sides must return to the negotiating table without delay. Time is running out.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must exert appropriate pressure, including on the Israeli Government, so that it will finally keep its promises, which it only ever makes in a vague manner. When we see the former Israeli ambassador in Germany, Avi Primor, clearly say in an interview today: ‘Benjamin Netanjahu has been promising a two-state solution for two years, but he is not doing anything about it, and the extreme right-wing coalition party in his government blocks everything that is on the table,’ then we also have to say that the ball is now in the Israeli Government’s court. It needs to take action at last and must not continue to fob the Palestinians off.</p>
<p class="contents">It will get us nowhere if once again we are told that it is to be put off again, because then we will still be in the same position in a year’s time. I believe that raising the status of Palestine in the UN, as has also now been done for the Vatican, is urgently required – Mr Kasoulides spoke about this. This is an important step, but without negotiations we will not achieve a lasting peace process in the Middle East.</p>

The planned recognition in the UN General Assembly is a unilateral measure on the part of the Palestinians and the daily continuation of the settlement policy is a unilateral measure on the part of Israel. Here, too, we are probably still in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it gets exciting, however: do we want to deter both sides from carrying out these two measures to the same extent? I fear not, and my country, Germany, is also playing its part here, because if that were the case, we would then have to consider in practical terms, for example, how we could encourage the present Israeli Government in future to no longer ignore the implications of the common position of the international community with regard to the settlement freeze.</p>
<p class="contents">After years of increasing political frustration and out of deep concern for the future viability of Israel, I am now of the opinion that we need to take measures within the framework of our contractual relations with the government there, also in the interests of the people in Israel, because, with its continuing policy, the government is not contributing to peace, but rather to further radicalisation in the region. That has to be our starting point.</p>

At this moment, something else is fundamental and I am saying this just as an aside to the fact that we are all addressing the whole peace process and how it should appear. I believe that at this time, the stance and strategy of the European Union is important. It is not possible, and it would be against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, to leave that question to individual Member States and to avoid the opinion of the European Union as a whole. It would be a mistake, as the European Union is perceived in the world and especially in the Arab world as an arbiter of international legitimacy. The so-called ‘soft power’ lends the European Union great credibility. Baroness Ashton and her office must therefore expend every effort to formulate a common European position on the Palestinian request. If we are successful in this, then we will certainly be able to formulate our own European proposals for the UN Security Council, but without a common position we will fail again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the right of Palestinians to self-rule. Secondly, the right of Israel to security. Thirdly, a lasting peace, which is the EU’s main interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we should consider every decision which will be taken, and also the proposal that has been submitted to the UN by Palestine. In brief, will this proposal and its implementation ensure peace? Now, I am deeply convinced of the fact that the Palestinians have the right to self-rule, but the process of creating a Palestinian state should take place in parallel with peace talks, talks which aim to build neighbourly relations, and in close cooperation with Israel. So it is extremely important that this should not be solely the creation of a state which really would not solve the problem, but that the EU should become firmly involved in ensuring this act will be linked with successful negotiations with Israel and conditional upon them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, on the other hand, the Israeli air force bombs Gaza there is silence, because it is natural for Israel to bomb the Palestinian people. Yet the lack of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main cause of conflict between the Arab world and the West, and it provides strength to extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the Arab revolutions have brought a fresh wave of democracy to North Africa and the Middle East. This cannot fail to have an effect on the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, too. The very existence of Israel is in some way linked to an understanding of this cause. Either Israel accepts the existence of a Palestinian state, or Israel will no longer be able to live in the same conditions in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, I believe that it would be very hypocritical for Europe not to give the Palestinians the same support that it is giving to those who are today fighting for freedom and rights in the Arab world and elsewhere. This is because I believe that the right of people to have their own land, to govern themselves, and to have their own state is an inalienable right, and I believe that Europe should support the Palestinian resolution at the UN. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The balance of power between Israel and its neighbours has shifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mubarak’s Egypt was committed to a policy of zero change, and this included relations with Israel. This is moving in a different direction as hitherto marginalised political forces in Egypt are emerging. Israel likewise had a stable neighbour under the repressive Assad regime in Syria, where the outcome of the pressure for change remains unclear. There is no guarantee that a putative end of the Assad regime will be of benefit to Israel. At the same time – others have mentioned this – Turkey has initiated a far-reaching improvement of its links with the Arab world and it has inevitably downgraded its relations with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">In an ideal world, this should provide an incentive for Israel to find a settlement with the Palestinians and to do so quickly. Time is running out – I am entirely in agreement with Mr De Rossa here – and it is vital for Israel’s future security that it come to terms with the changes. If not, it will very likely be coerced into them in much less favourable circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many EU countries, however, can already see the problems that may easily be caused by a symbolic, unilateral declaration of independence, with no peace agreement.

<p class="contents">Support for a unilateral declaration would also be irresponsible, because Fatah and Hamas have now signed a letter of intent concerning a unity government, and Hamas is actually a terrorist organisation.

Even Prime Minister Netanyahu is talking about a two-state solution. If the question is whether we want to reach a compromise, the answer is probably ‘yes’, too, as we know that both parties will have had to take part in a compromise or at least have indicated their acceptance in some way. Do we believe that the situation will be resolved if the international community takes a unilateral decision regarding a Palestinian state and Israel is left completely isolated? Politics, at the end of the day, has to be the art of the possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that deep down we imagine that it is possible to take a decision without Israel being involved in the negotiations. That is what was stated in the Oslo Accords, and it is also what the Quartet has said, namely that both parties must be involved and that it is a question of negotiations. Those of us who are continually pleading for negotiations are clearly no less interested in progress being made in the peace process. Rather, we believe that it is a prerequisite for progress in the peace process that negotiations should take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we are making it a little too easy for ourselves by talking all the time about the 1967 borders as if they could simply be there as something already in place and ready to use.

There is a great deal of tension; tension which may escalate into a real crisis. One of the main causes of this dangerous situation is the refusal by a candidate country, by which I mean Turkey, to accept that a Member State of the European Union, by which I mean the Republic of Cyprus, is entitled to exercise its legal and sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this refusal has been accompanied by official statements and the threat of harsh response, from which military reaction is not excluded, if the Republic of Cyprus exercises these rights, is giving further cause for concern. It goes without saying, of course, that exploitation of these wealth-producing resources is compatible with the need to safeguard energy security in Europe and to diversify energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly hope, Commissioner, that it will not be necessary to take recourse to the mutual assistance clause in the Treaty of Lisbon.

Great politicians and diplomats have already tried to solve this problem, so far unsuccessfully. The only way to solve this problem is of course successful peace talks. I realise and we all realise that these discussions are difficult due to external conditions and due to the internal situation in Palestine and the possibly even more complicated internal situation in Israel. It is not possible to hold bilateral talks at the moment, but hopefully the Quartet is a forum that we can count on and which the EU should actively support and in which it should participate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new Egyptian administration does not feel too bound by the agreements concluded by President Mubarak with Israel. Inspired by the successes of the Arab Spring, the Palestinians decided to take the final step in the legalisation of their efforts to building an independent state, and addressed their request for the recognition of their rights to the United Nations. The people of Israel, who have for many years been squeezed by high taxes to ensure their defence, are demanding a more dignified and peaceful life. The Israeli Government wants to see nothing, hear nothing and negotiate with nobody, instead occupying more and more Palestinian territory. In the Islamic world, Israel has never been a very popular country and to be under the illusion that this early Christian island in a vast Islamic sea with an arrogant policy of occupying Arab land would not sooner or later provoke an open military conflict, would probably be naive.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that in order to maintain peace in this area, we should use all our diplomatic options and abilities to bring participants to the negotiating table in order to build two independent friendly countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, Turkey is attempting to fill the vacuum created by the Arab Spring. Thus, Mr Erdogan – and this is, of course, crazy – is currently the most popular Head of State in the Arab world, even though he is not an Arab.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Erdogan’s external policy is marked by the weakening of relations with the West in general and with Israel in particular. Thus, Ankara ceased its military cooperation with Israel, while at the same time Turkey significantly increased its military presence in the Mediterranean. Trade relations with Israel have ceased and Mr Erdogan is threatening to take further measures. This aggressive attitude at the expense of Israel is intended to help Ankara to establish its dominance in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope for an easing of the situation.

The Israeli and Palestinian sides have diametrically opposing views on the form and content of these negotiations. The negotiations should continue focusing on the acceptance of the requirements of both parties. Although it seems that the chances of a resumption of negotiations have diminished in the current situation, no one doubts the urgent need for progress in resolving the conflict based on a two-state principle. This should not, however, lead to a challenge to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, nor the right of Palestinians to achieve statehood. Now the European Union and its diplomacy should make every effort to restore negotiations and ensure their success. I think it will, amongst other things, be good preparation for the Union's diplomacy in the preparations for the negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo, which are affecting its immediate neighbourhood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will pass on the various themes of today’s debate to the High Representative, because as we all know in the forthcoming days and weeks her involvement in these matters will have absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I think in summing up the debate we can all emphasise that the EU must not waste a single day or spare any effort if it wants to support the peace process. I think it is very important that diplomacy should become the tool which will decide the future of the region. I hope that diplomacy will bring results in the next few weeks. Our conviction is that the role of the EU in this process will be very significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that we spoke about other themes today that some Members brought up directly. I would like to say a few words regarding the situation in Camp Ashraf. The High Representative is fully aware of the situation in the camp. She has already discussed the matter with Member States, emphasising its sensitive and delicate nature, and above all the key significance of the humanitarian situation. Members of the European Parliament should be fully aware that the High Representative is fully determined and is ready to work with all the partners involved in the matter, which are Iraq, the United States and the EU Member States. The High Representative will try to work out a solution to this very difficult problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the debate. I do not want to summarise it fully because, as I have already said, it contained many different themes.

The European Union must develop a common position so that the Member States speak with a single voice, both when drawing up the United Nations resolution and when voting. However, even after the vote in the United Nations, the essence remains the same – a sustainable solution to this conflict will only be found via diplomatic means and bilateral negotiations. I believe that the Palestinian Authority has done its homework well, as has been recognised. It understands that the unilateral declaration may delay the reopening of negotiations, but it has secondary objectives. I believe that the Palestinians really want to establish a functioning state, and it needs borders, a government, democratic governance and peaceful co-existence with its neighbours. The question remains as to how this state will govern both parts of Palestine. Gaza is controlled by Hamas which is openly hostile to the Israeli state. On its own, a change of status at the United Nations will not resolve the problems. Only bilateral negotiations can do this. What follows after 20 September will depend to a large degree on Israel’s reaction. It is worrying that, in the situation that is still evolving, Israel is losing long-standing supporters, and true allies are finding themselves in increasing isolation. Israel has the right to defend itself from terrorist attacks, but the building of settlements is not legitimate and it must be halted immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
