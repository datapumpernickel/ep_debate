<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Špidla,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, problems relating to the steel industry appear regularly on Parliament’s agenda, even though the complex period of large-scale restructuring in this sector is now over, at least in Western Europe, and even though the European steel industry is generally competitive. It is true that companies in this sector are still adapting to economic competition and to global market conditions, however, and this is why restructuring has been carried out so regularly in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first of all like to emphasise that the generally satisfactory state of the European steel industry at present is undoubtedly based on the capabilities of businesses and their workers, as well as on a general capability to adapt to changing conditions. These capabilities have been demonstrated in the past, and I am sure they will be demonstrated again in the future. It is essential that this sector, in common with all industrial sectors and services, adapts constantly, and these adaptations form the basis of future prosperity. Yet this does not mean that we can forget our collective responsibility for ensuring that the process of change takes into consideration the men and women who work in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for today’s debate in this House is again the ThyssenKrupp plant in Terni. Parliament discussed the future of this plant a year ago, and it appeared that negotiations would end happily, since the company abandoned the plans it had announced a few weeks earlier to close the plant, or at any rate postponed these plans. Yet now it unfortunately appears that ThyssenKrupp intends to put its original ideas into practice. It is not for the Commission to judge whether a decision of this kind is economically justified, or to become directly involved in this process in any way, unless Community rules are infringed. Nothing points to this being the case at present. The Commission is not in possession of any information that would lead it to believe that the company is contravening the standards applied in such cases, whether these be standards governing working relationships or standards in other fields. As far as we are aware, no complaints or statements have been submitted in this respect. If this were to happen, the Commission would of course take the appropriate steps in execution of the powers conferred to it on the basis of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Economically speaking, we may bemoan the decision on the fate of this factory and this plant, and we must take account of any negative impact the decision will have on hundreds of people and on the prosperity of the region if it is confirmed. We may regret that the efforts made by officials in the regional administration for over a year, and which I believe should be acknowledged, were not enough to prevent the termination of some of the activities at the plant in Terni. The company is free to make such decisions, however, and as such its decision must be respected. The company’s freedom must be respected, but it also has responsibilities, in particular with respect to the full and effective involvement of the workers and their representatives in the decision-making process. Reference is made to this in several Community directives and in national legislation. and it can only be reiterated that they must be observed even in difficult circumstances such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">The company is also responsible for any social consequences that a partial stoppage of production may have. It is likely that the workers affected will be redeployed to other activities within the plant, but in any case solutions other than redundancy should be found, in accordance with well established procedures. If redundancies are essential, steps should be taken to help the affected workers to adapt to the new circumstances. These principles for the management of restructuring were established three years ago by European social partners themselves, on the basis of a Commission request. I can therefore now address broader questions, which reach beyond the bounds of the matters we are looking at today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently proposed that the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment be renewed. In order for us to achieve this ambitious goal in the context of the significant economic and social changes we are currently experiencing, we must successfully overcome the problems of restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">The social agenda adopted by the Commission a fortnight ago also includes measures which will help our companies, our workers and all other parties involved in the process of change to put any advantages to the best possible use, and to resolve any problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few weeks’ time I intend to propose that the Commission should adopt a communication on the European Union’s general strategy for the management of restructuring and an ambitious programme to enhance the potential for economic renewal and make provision for related problems. The key phrase in this strategy will be preparing for the future at all levels. The Union has developed policies, programmes and instruments to make it easier for companies and workers to adapt to the changing world. These include an employment policy, an industrial policy, social dialogue, Community legislation and financial support instruments. It is now time to coordinate these different aspects more effectively and to develop new, future-oriented approaches, making it possible to anticipate future developments and enabling individual players to prepare for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that preparing for change at all levels, and in particular at sector, local and company level, is primarily dependent upon partnership and social dialogue. I propose that the Commission should use this communication to entrust European social partners with the task of implementing the second phase of consultation on two major themes, namely on the role of European works councils as mediators of change, and on the use of general principles laid down by social partners on the management of restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need to strengthen social dialogue at sector level, and this dialogue must supplement Community industrial policy. Different forms of social dialogue need to be developed, with the main one with regard to preparation for and management of change and restructuring being collective bargaining. The social agenda depends on the creation of a non-binding optional Community framework, which would facilitate the conclusion of supranational collective agreements and represent a specially adapted instrument for restructuring at European, and even global level.</p>
<p class="contents">These are a few elements of the strategy which we should like to develop in partnership with the other Community bodies, the social partners, public authorities at all levels and all those for whom the strategy is intended. I am aware that this kind of political initiative does not provide a direct and immediate answer to those affected by the restructuring of the plant in Terni. The existing Community policies and instruments, for which we aim to achieve even greater effectiveness in the future, can now be used to deal with the social consequences of the decision, which I hope, in spite of everything, can still be altered in some way following dialogue with all the parties involved. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The decision by ThyssenKrupp first to close the magnetic steel production line and then to lay off and release hundreds of workers at the Terni plant is not just a breach of all the agreements signed at the time of privatisation but also a decision that makes no economic sense. The company has, in fact, been given special treatment by all the national and European institutions in a way that no other Italian company in the sector has.</p>
<p class="contents">We just have to recall the public investment it has received, starting with the Objective 2 Structural Funds – in that respect I foresee possible Commission intervention – not to mention the recent commitment by the Italian Government to guarantee its power supply on economically favourable terms until the required new power plant is built. In addition, all the problems associated with putting in the infrastructure needed to improve the plant have been solved by the Italian Government. We must not forget the market for magnetic steel, either: Italy is its largest market, together with Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult, therefore, to understand the reasons that have led ThyssenKrupp not to conclude the talks on signing the draft agreement aimed at ending the dispute, as they are now in their final stages. The suspicion arises, then, that the negative results issued by the company may be connected to decisions designed solely to make inter-group transfers at prices favourable to its associated companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is not just a gesture of solidarity, but it seeks to represent Parliament’s commitment to mobilise the Commission and the Member States to intervene with initiatives to avert downsizing in the steel industry. We also call on the German Government to intervene with ThyssenKrupp’s top management immediately so that they resume talks with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Relocation, above all to China, must not happen without complying with human and union rights, beginning with the rights of the Chinese workers themselves. The Terni affair, Mr President, does not just involve Italy. It is a European affair, and one which must not be underestimated, because it is typical of the whole steel sector. That is why all the institutions and all the political groups are being asked to draw up concrete proposals to protect the steel industry, jobs and also research, because research is conducted at the Terni plant as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a serious mistake for us not to condemn the company’s refusal to listen to constructive proposals, a mistake that should be condemned by all the political groups. That is why we appeal to the German Government again to intervene with ThyssenKrupp’s top management immediately, to make them realise the importance of the Terni plant and the mistake that they have just made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know whether to regard it as a lack of respect towards this Parliament, which is debating the matter, or merely as an open admission by the company of the contradictions that come with industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a few days ago, the company sent a letter to Members of the European Parliament – I do not know how widely – in which it said it wanted to protect its position on magnetic steel and also to invest in stainless steel. The decisions it has just made contradict all that. The fact is that the decision to close down the magnetic steel division is causing serious employment problems and having adverse repercussions on the whole plant and the Terni area.</p>
<p class="contents">In employment terms, this decision may cause the loss of more than 1 500 jobs in the steelworks and allied industries. As if that were not enough, ThyssenKrupp no longer seems to show any interest in enjoying its infrastructure and energy-cost benefits, after repeatedly asking for them. Clearly, that means that it wants a free hand: a free hand gradually to dismantle the stainless steel production line too, which according to the company should actually be the plant’s core business.</p>
<p class="contents">We seem to have seen it all before. After taking over the Italian market, the company is gradually reducing production volumes at Terni, with magnetic steel production being abandoned so that investment can be made elsewhere. Downgraded to regional status, with its production volumes severely cut – I am talking about 800 000 tonnes a year, compared with its capacity of 2 million tonnes a year – and with high energy costs, the Terni steelworks would then basically end up being dismantled.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we perhaps maligning the company? Why, then, has it been making stainless steel in a decades-old plant for the last three years while a new plant, just three years old, has hardly been used at all? I think everyone now knows that it is hard to find a kilo of steel of any kind, because the market is showing clear signs of a severe shortage of materials, soaring prices, and worldwide production capacity fully saturated for a long time. It is quite clear that pulling out from Terni would push prices up further and would leave Italy’s electromechanical industry in serious difficulties, as it accounts for 40% of European consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The company has not even been willing to consider alternative solutions, such as promoting a consortium of Italian users similar to the one that already exists in the United Kingdom; supplying hot coils from Germany, as is already done for certain production plants (such as Genselkirchen and even competing plants, such as Newport); or reactivating an electric furnace that has already been installed at Terni, which requires only modest investment for environmental reasons. As a result, we now find ourselves in this difficult situation, which for us is unacceptable because of the production costs and social costs involved.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we find a way out of this situation? First of all, the company should be asked to accept its responsibilities with regard to the commitments it has made and the agreements it has signed. Secondly, it should resume talks with the social partners and local bodies, as these are currently not taking place. We believe that dialogue between the parties is essential in order to find solutions to the current problems. Thirdly – and I address this to the Commissioner in particular – it is important to be consistent with the Lisbon strategy, which seeks to achieve competitiveness by protecting and expanding the production base, rather than closing down plants, which is precisely the opposite approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe it is absolutely vital not only to provide answers on the state of restructuring processes across Europe but also to give some serious, in-depth consideration to the kind of industrial policy that Europe needs in order to deal with problems of competitiveness. The sooner we do that, the better. By discussing such important topics, Parliament can make a tremendous contribution to a positive solution for the Terni steelworks affair and can provide real prospects for the future of European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is doing so this evening after a long debate among the political groups in recent weeks, which has resulted in a broad compromise on the text of the resolution which is to be put to the vote tomorrow. It is a balanced text and one that should attract broad agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic in question should be seen in the context of achieving the Lisbon objectives as well as greater economic and social cohesion, since the sector employs a large number of workers in Europe, includes areas of excellence and produces technologically high-quality products. These are genuine reference models for the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">ThyssenKrupp, partly through Acciai Speciali Terni, has until now unquestionably been numbered among the leading world producers of stainless and magnetic sheet steel and has been at the forefront of research. In its own investment plan, the company committed itself to making Terni the European centre of excellence for magnetic steel, based partly on the infrastructure and energy-cost benefits guaranteed by the Italian Government in June 2004. It should also be borne in mind that extra investment from the European Social Fund has been used to develop local systems, infrastructure and vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitments I have just mentioned would not be honoured if there were a change in corporate strategy, and the consequence – as we are now learning – would be a gradual reduction in employment levels through the implementation of as yet unspecified procedures. What that means is that thousands of jobs would be lost within a fairly short time, which would be an extremely dangerous precedent. We call on the Commission today to stand by its own decisions and to ensure that those who are granted Community funding should honour the commitments they make, including their choice of location. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What will show the real value of the social pieties constantly recited at EU level and only a couple of weeks ago ceremoniously set down in writing, not only as part of the Lisbon process, but also in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe? It will be the treatment of Thyssen-Krupp’s workforce at Terni in Umbria, which is a depressed area.</p>
<p class="contents">This commitment to the objective of full employment, to social cohesion, to the social responsibilities associated with ownership, to social dialogue – just what is it worth? Is this all no more than a dead letter? Can one simply ignore it all whenever one is overcome by the craving for profit? After all, one will not be punished for it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have to resist – the flouting of Europe’s social benefits, which are essential to civilised life and work on this continent of ours, and also essential in terms of our own capacity for competition and innovation. If Europe is to be able to succeed in extending its influence to the rest of the world, its social conscience must not be allowed to slumber.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening at Thyssen-Krupp is also, for us, about putting these things to the test in a practical way. A lot of money from the European Structural and Social Funds has been spent on it; to what extent are the EU Member States and the Commission willing and able to insist on their conditions for the subsidy of businesses actually being kept to? That is something that not only the affected workers and their families can expect; so, too, can taxpayers the length and breadth of Europe, in the interests, among other things, of the future viability of a vital industrial sector – one that was, after all, godfather to Europe’s first community, that of coal and steel. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting in favour of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, a small delegation from that working community came to Strasbourg at their own expense. Indeed, although we may be discussing Terni, a small town in Italy, we are actually debating the future of the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who are not familiar with it, Terni is a town in the green countryside of Umbria that is different from the others. Located in the region of Lake Trasimeno, with its little medieval towns and the mysticism of Saint Francis and the renaissance painters, Terni has, for 120 years, been a town of steel and steelworkers. Its lifeblood is the steelworks and, through innovation, it has been able to protect and to improve its production for over a century, even during the war.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no valid economic reasons why the production of magnetic sheet steel should be concentrated in France and Germany: in 2004 ThyssenKrupp made a net profit of many millions of euros from the Terni plant. Only a few months ago, in June, the company signed an agreement with the social partners, witnessed by the Italian Government, to revitalise production at the Terni plant, and the European Parliament voted to support the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the owners of the company seem to want to tear up those agreements by announcing today that 600 workers will be made redundant as of tomorrow, after having already got rid of the 370 workers in the magnetic steel sector. The letter the company sent to us Members of the European Parliament is therefore belied by the facts, as well as by the contradictions in the letter itself, and it has further convinced me that we must vote for the unified resolution that we have tabled both for substantive reasons and for the sake of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is even more tragic and unacceptable when one thinks of the dignity of those European citizens and their families who have been protesting for more than a year, and of the rules for social dialogue in Europe, for which all the Community institutions have pleaded so hard, especially the Commission. We are expecting the Commission to give this Chamber some concrete answers, which so far have not been forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">If signed and sealed agreements are ignored and an already submitted investment plan is loudly denied, it is a serious matter for the whole of Europe, because it would give rise to a European Union dominated by uncontrolled relocations, industrial dismissals and speculative thinking, which would inevitably drag it into decline and crisis. Intervening in the Terni case therefore means intervening for the future of each one of us and performing a duty that upholds the genuine interests of a Europe of work and development. Furthermore, if all other approaches are constantly blocked, it would be appropriate to resort to public intervention to guarantee the future that would otherwise be denied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Italy is doing what it can at all levels to resolve the ThyssenKrupp case. It is now time for Germany to send out some positive signals as well, and for the European Union to accept its own responsibilities. We all know that the Terni affair is not the first or the only case. There is a long list of companies that have made considerable profits in part through the sacrifice, commitment and professionalism of their workers, and have then chosen to relocate, often to non-EU countries, unscrupulously dumping the resulting job and social crisis on the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As a number of Members have already stated, while ThyssenKrupp has on the one hand reassured us with a letter, on the other it has today announced its so-called ‘release’ of 630 workers this morning. How can that not be seen as an arrogant way to behave? It shows that ThyssenKrupp has no intention of taking any notice of what Parliament is preparing to vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is our duty, especially to the workers and their families, to propose practical measures today, and so we ask the Commission for some specific commitments. First, we need legislation on corporate social responsibility, combining competitiveness with respect for the rights of workers and regions. Above all, however, we call on the Commission to stop dodging the main challenge facing Europe’s economy, on which the future of the European economic system depends: in other words, the ‘relocation’ crisis. The European Union is virtually still in the dark ages on this issue, whereas instead it is essential to intervene with a strategy to limit and regulate relocations both within and outside the EU, to guarantee, among other things, growth and employment, competitiveness and innovation: in short, to achieve the principal objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, which has the specific duty to represent the rights and expectations of European citizens, must have the courage to send the Commission a strong, unified document that does not ignore the crucial question of relocation, which is putting the future of Europe’s economy at stake. We therefore call on you to vote for our amendment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hurried e-mail from ThyssenKrupp, full of promises, which was sent to Members of the European Parliament this afternoon in anticipation of this debate, is not at all convincing. It is time for action, not words.</p>
<p class="contents">Behind the hundreds of redundancies that have been announced lies the tragedy of hundreds of families who see an uncertain and more difficult future ahead. A few days ago I held a political meeting of the new PSI at the Terni steelworks, where I could see unequivocally that Terni and Umbria as a whole are united and determined to fight on bravely and hard, not only in defence of their own productive and economic environment, but above all to uphold the dignity of the local community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community institutions in general must not remain silent at this stage, since massive disinvestment and relocations of valuable production plant to non-EU countries are tearing Europe’s overall productive capacity apart. Moreover, it should be made clear in this specific case that ThyssenKrupp received funds and tax breaks from the Union when it decided to buy the Terni plant, and it gave an assurance that it would keep production in Italy and safeguard jobs. All these commitments have been ignored in favour of Far Eastern scenarios. We should be asking ourselves what those scenarios are and to what extent union rights and guarantees will be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1950, Robert Schuman launched the High Authority for Coal and Steel, thus establishing the basis and the guidelines for an ambitious and comprehensive journey towards unification, and not just in the economic sphere. Now that such a complex political project has made great advances, let us not allow this particular strategic sector to be dismantled by remaining silent.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional actors, especially the government, the Umbria region, the province and Terni municipality, need to agree on a common strategy with the social partners, who should be involved to a greater extent in the decision-making processes. The strategy should then be put firmly, frankly and decisively to ThyssenKrupp. The company must accept its own responsibilities and give up its confused and somewhat devious defensive tactics. It should also be made clear that any further grant of public money should be conditional upon agreements – specific ones agreed by both sides this time – on jobs and local development and on investments designed to modernise production.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, raising our voice to seek and to demand immediate, concrete solutions along these lines is our political duty, in order to preserve and protect a section of our economic network. It is also a moral duty to those hundreds of workers, family men and women, who, with their eyes full of hope and never resigned, have been protesting at the gates of their steelworks for months. Let us in this Chamber send them a clear message: ‘Stand firm in your demands for the right to a future for yourselves and your children. Now that we are united, we stand beside you.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The appeal for intervention on the part of the German Government does not carry much weight.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to hear Commissioner Špidla say that there are no indications that the agreements have been breached. Documents sent to me by Thyssen-Krupp state that the company invested EUR 700 million in the last few years and received a total of EUR 17 million in subsidies. With a global steel market totalling one billion tonnes, it follows that domestic production of 1.2 million tonnes amounts to rather more than one-thousandth of global steel production, along with the 70 000 tonnes of magnetic circuit band with which we are concerned, for it is here that there have been losses, the cause for which is to be found not only in Italy, but also in the laws enacted by the European Union, in the high cost of energy and in the legislation on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I think of the requirements we have imposed on emissions trading, requirements demanded by the steel industry in particular, in order that the technical minimum standards that it already has should apply throughout Europe – for coal is indispensable to the production of steel, and there are technical limits in this field; I recall how consideration is being given throughout the industry to investing in a way that involves firms relocating to places where the Kyoto Protocol is not binding; I consider how the ore-smelters, particularly those in the countries that are major producers of raw materials, have announced an imminent 90% rise in the price of these, and the massive demand for them that exists in China. All these things are framework conditions, and, to my mind, they make it necessary that the Commission should address not only what is happening at Terni – enormously important though that of course is for the workers concerned – but also the steel sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above what is happening at Terni, it is for that reason that we demand, in paragraph 8 of the resolution, a communication, an inventory, and the setting-up of a high-level group, for we must, in the long term, safeguard steel as a raw material in the European Union, and hence its productive base and locations, albeit also independently of the latter. This is an objective we all share, and so we support our Italian fellow Members in their initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outrage expressed from every quarter last year caused ThyssenKrupp to reconsider its decision to close its Terni plant. It went further: in June 2004 it signed a new agreement with a new investment plan.</p>
<p class="contents">This plan, as has already been said, promised to make Terni a centre of excellence in magnetic sheet steel production, which is strange in light of what Mr Langen has just said. In return it would receive infrastructure and energy cost benefits under an agreement with the Italian Government. These were in addition to the substantial benefits the company received directly or indirectly from Europe's Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Just seven months later, ThyssenKrupp has torn up that agreement – and that is the issue we are considering here this evening. It has gone ahead with closure, bypassing the social partners, the Italian Government and others who were party to the agreement. The company is the latest in a long line to make a mockery of EU laws on worker information and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned the Social Agenda adopted just two weeks ago. Let me quote a heading from that: ' Moving towards full employment: making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change'. I am sure those words will ring hollow in the ears of the workers hit by this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not criticising the Commission; I applaud many of the ideas Mr Špidla has included in the new Social Agenda. Let me remind you of some. The Agenda underlines the need for a proactive approach to the positive management of industrial change. It talks of the need to reinforce social dialogue, update legislation on collective redundancies and update and consolidate existing laws on information and consultation. It launches the idea of transnational collective bargaining. Finally, in the context of this debate, it underlines the need for improved corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The outrageous behaviour of ThyssenKrupp in Italy underlines the need for all these things and more to be done as a matter of urgency. What do I mean by 'more'? Let me say two things in closing. The first is that although the new Social Agenda foresees the creation of a number of high level groups, it fails to include a number of good ideas from past high level groups. How about the recommendations of the 1998 Gyllenhammar Group on Industrial Change that companies should produce annual managing change reports, and that any company dismissing workers without safeguarding their employability should be barred from access to public funds? Only when CSR includes such provisions, will companies like ThyssenKrupp take any notice of it at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you say that the Commission is powerless. When the closure was announced at the beginning of last year, the Commission and its President joined Parliament in roundly condemning the decision. I hope, Commissioner, you can give us the assurance this evening that you will do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the restructuring measures and mergers within the industry, we are very concerned, for several reasons, by the loss of entire sections of the production structure in Europe. There is the chronic loss of jobs in the industry, the risk of losing technological know-how and the knock-on effects on other economic activities, such as vehicle manufacturing, aerospace, energy production and the construction industry. There are also consequences for research: how can we develop the new materials vital for the technology of tomorrow if our steel industry disappears?</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the European Union must have a duty and a right to intervene in the activities of the steel industry, by using public funds, where necessary, to support steel companies’ research and development activities, by monitoring public investments to ensure that they help to safeguard or develop employment and to modernise industrial plant and processes, by adopting a more resolute strategy on industrial restructuring and its social impact, by supporting moves to restructure the steel industry or to switch to manufacturing products with high added value, by creating favourable conditions, especially for cutting-edge, high-tech sectors, through the allocation of EU funds under the seventh framework R&amp;D programme</p>
<p class="contents">Practice makes perfect or, as the French proverb says, forging makes a blacksmith. In short, we must keep forging if we are to keep our blacksmiths and steelworkers, and we must keep forging to acquire more know-how and invent the steels of tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe can and must provide a different response.</p>
<p class="contents">If we based our judgment solely on the harsh and unpalatable logic, which undoubtedly exists – the logic of numbers, which may appear solid but which are in fact intangible – we should neither understand the problem nor be able to analyse it, since the concepts invoked are delocation, globalisation and compatibility. This is all part of the paradigm, not only of this particular multinational company, but also of so many other multinationals which, throughout their history, have often obtained large amounts of aid from national governments and significant incentives from the European Community, and then, with their traditional propensity to nationalise losses and privatise profits, carry on down this same path impervious to either guarantees or rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe we need and want to develop must be different. It must be a Europe in which labour as an abstract concept is obviously important, but where human beings are also important; a Europe in which the company’s interests count, but so do those of the workers. The direction in which this truly emblematic case is pointing leaves us feeing profoundly embittered because this is not the type of Europe we want to build.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to agree with Commissioner Špidla on the need to move towards social dialogue. However, at the very time when Parliament is preparing, fortunately with a degree of unanimity, to approve a resolution obliging ThyssenKrupp to face up to its responsibilities, we have seen that the company concerned, this very morning – shortly before being subjected to the judgment of freely-elected European Members of Parliament – is laying off over 600 employees. Is this social dialogue? Is this the Europe we want? Frankly, I believe that greater weight must be given to this Parliament’s opposition and that the will of the people’s representatives must genuinely be made to count for something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we know today that you can do business only if customers are willing to buy, businesses go bust or move away if policies are not in place to create the right conditions for them, and my specific question to Commissioner Špidla is this: what will you do in order, in so far as possible, to limit the adverse effects of emissions trading on the steel industry? We are faced with the prospect of a 15% rise in the cost of steel production, with another 15% being added on for energy costs. That represents a threat to Europe’s steel industry as a whole. What will you be doing to prevent REACH from having detrimental effects on the steel industry, which is threatened and at serious risk? And will you, in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, be taking up the steel industry’s cause?</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, this is also about how we guard the steel industry against the threat of the international hedge funds, with their speculation in steel, coke and coal meaning that responsible management is now no longer possible. This is where the Lisbon process imposes on us the responsibility of focussing on Europe’s lawmaking and of standing up for our industrial firms in order to safeguard the jobs they provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing as we do today that five million jobs have been lost in Germany, and that there are five million more unemployed, we really do have to give some thought to how we get Europe’s industrial policies to create new jobs rather than doing away with ones that already exist. This is where our Commissioner has a particular responsibility to make every effort for the sake of our jobs, and I thank him in anticipation of his doing just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have an obligation to do that. The steel industry is an important sector for us: it accounts for a fifth of all global manufacturing. We need it; it is a major source of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition is driving us into a tough situation that can only have an effect on job numbers, unless we intervene. We cannot, however, start to compete with the Chinese on pay. We have to maintain high standards in goods, working conditions, and pay as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to international competition, the European steel sector has to meet tighter environmental standards with the advent of emissions trading in the Union and the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol. The steel industry is the largest of all the energy-consuming industrial sectors and one of the most significant causes of carbon dioxide emissions. It should therefore cut its greenhouse gases either by investing in new technology or by purchasing emissions rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention that in my country the steel industry invested heavily in environmental technology years ago. We have been able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as far as is possible with current know-how. The steel industry in my country is indeed one of the cleanest in the world. Under the Kyoto Protocol, however, a steel industry that years ago invested resources to become one of the cleanest has to buy emissions rights from dirtier industries such as Russia’s. So those that did not bother about the environment in earlier times are selling emissions rights to those who have cleaned up their industry. The cleaner industries are therefore paying for the dirtier ones. Timely investment in the environment reduces the competitiveness of the most modern and cleanest factory. The one that works better is worse in terms of its competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Spidla, how do you intend to act to prevent cleaner industries from having to reward dirtier ones in the context of emissions trading? Europe needs its own steel sector: it lies at the heart of our basic manufacturing, and we have to remain self-sufficient. Commissioner, could the Commission look into the possibility of somehow easing the situation in this sector of industry while keeping within WTO rules? The Commission should also draw up a fundamental strategy for those vital sectors of industry in which our self-sufficiency is important. Could we engage in more research and product development to improve this sector’s competitiveness? At the same time, it is obviously essential that our trading partners, starting with the United States of America, should join the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

<p class="contents">Social concerns are increasing, because what is at stake is the economy of a town, a region and thousands of families. The problem of Terni, Commissioner, is the problem of Italian and European industry as a whole. The resolution we have signed does not only represent a token of solidarity with the workers and institutions present this evening, and with the workers involved, but also reflects the commitment of the European Parliament to rethink the major strategies of industrial policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe, within the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact, must rethink a policy to stem the distorted effects of globalisation, which itself needs to be reconsidered. We cannot, in the name of globalisation and unfettered competition, throw away social protection, workers’ rights and environmental safeguards. Public action must provide the motive power for innovation, research and industrial renewal, based on a new competitiveness – not one which involves destroying the industrial fabric of both Italy and Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">As part of the current debate on the Financial Perspective, we need to ask ourselves what resources have to be committed to investment in order to relaunch economic development and create new jobs. We also need to ask ourselves, Commissioner, what control and assessment mechanisms need to be introduced to verify and ensure that industrial projects which require public financing are able and obliged to provide protection for jobs. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this issue raises a large number of questions. The Terni case is, in many ways, just the tip of the iceberg. We must not fail to deal with this problem, which represents the true challenge facing Italian and European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to bite my tongue and avoid referring back to some of the demands made concerning the REACH regulations, which will come into force in eleven years' time, undermining the competitiveness of Italian and European industry, which now seems to be facing very different and more immediate competitive challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I have long union experience behind me, on which I should like to draw to make two observations. Firstly, exactly one year ago, on 10 February 2004, we were discussing here in Parliament the case of Terni, the steel industry and the wider crisis in European steel-making. On that very day we were informed that the dispute was being resolved at ministerial level and that negotiations were being started which were ultimately to lead to the June agreement which, today, ThyssenKrupp has once again torn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was such an agreement possible at that time? In my view, for one fundamental reason only: because ThyssenKrupp had been isolated, both nationally and on a European level. The exceptional mobilisation of the workers and citizens of Terni and Umbria, as previously referred to, played a leading part in that political process. The Terni plant is not a mere factory; it is an integral part of the town. Today, the same situation is being played out once again. Today, as before, we are seeing an attack not only on a professional body, a production capability, a tradition, but on the dignity of the entire population of a town. This must be the starting point for the renewal of a powerful unity which will again leave ThyssenKrupp in an isolated position.</p>
<p class="contents">A second comment also drawn from my union background: why has ThyssenKrupp chosen today to take two apparently contradictory initiatives? It has sent us the letter describing the problems in detail, while simultaneously laying off, or threatening to lay off, a further 600 workers, for more or less plausible reasons. In my view, the company is afraid of being isolated again by this Parliament. That explains the importance of the agenda on which we shall be voting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I appreciated your speech and the pointers you gave, notwithstanding the Commission’s limited powers, of which we are perfectly well aware. However, the Commission can perhaps do something politically, possibly at the most senior level, as it did last year, thereby making a significant contribution to the isolation of ThyssenKrupp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unanimous agreement on the resolution shows that the concern is neither isolated nor rhetorical, but is a general and international recognition of the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">A reassuring letter was received by all Members yesterday, as has already been mentioned. It reiterates the fact there will be no alteration in employment. That, of course, does not convince us; on the contrary, it is even more worrying in the light of the 600 workers being laid off. The letter appears to be – I do not know if the Latin saying can be translated – a case of ‘<span class="italic">excusatio non petita, accusatio manifesta </span>[an unsolicited excuse is an obvious accusation]’.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive measures adopted by the Italian Government in support of the Terni steelworks and the attention given by all the Institutions have served little purpose. The suspicion that ThyssenKrupp may be caving in to Asian, particularly Chinese, competition is now a certainty. The problem is not only the job losses in Terni, although these alone are sufficient cause for concern. It is even more serious because it represents a fully-fledged strategy of delocation or – not to mince words – pulling out, after many years benefiting from subsidies which have produced vast profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would have expected a little more from your speech. It seemed more like a recital of the events that have happened than a strong affirmation of European industrial policy. We therefore request that this issue be dealt with on a strategic level by the European Commission, which has the strength and political muscle to tackle it, to show that it accepts the consequences of a possible silence, which would result in a catastrophic failure of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that the European steel industry is a very important component of our economy and, in its own way, of our European identity. It is also quite clear that consideration is given in the Lisbon strategy to industrial policy. One of the strategic decisions included in this document is to support European industry and to facilitate its stabilisation and development, since industry is a key part of our European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European steel industry has undergone significant restructuring, and it is competitive. It is quite clear that there will of course be further partial restructuring, and such restructuring must be backed up by appropriate social measures. As regards the Commission’s role, I must say that its powers are limited in this case; to put it more precisely, the Commission has no power to take action against the ThyssenKrupp management and to persuade it or force it to change its decision.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the relocation of the factory, or part of the production at this factory, to the Federal Republic of Germany, it is generally said that we are free to choose where to locate the production of goods and where to provide services within the European Union. This derives from the idea of the internal market, and it is enshrined in the Treaties we have approved. It is of course clear that restructuring of this kind is always accompanied by social problems and difficulties, and this is why we need a public policy which enables these sectors, regions and workers to make the necessary adjustments, and which guarantees an appropriate level of protection. This is also one of the aims of the Commission communication I intend to present as soon as possible on restructuring and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reaffirm the importance of social dialogue when preparing for and managing restructuring. The communication I mentioned will therefore represent a second phase of consultation with European social partners on issues relating to the restructuring of companies and on European works councils. I firmly believe that the social partners will take up this challenge, and enter into negotiations aimed at introducing mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of guidelines for restructuring, and that they will also exploit the capabilities of European works councils as mediators of change within companies.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the matter of whether Thyssen was granted any Community funding in Italy, the Commission has approached the competent Italian bodies for an answer to this question, and we are currently awaiting their response. If confirmation is given that funding was granted, however, and that the conditions under which it was granted have not been observed, the Commission would of course insist that the competent Italian bodies should take the appropriate steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that according to the existing arrangements, assistance cannot continue to be granted under the Structural Funds if the business involved undergoes fundamental changes, for example if it is relocated within five years following the decision to allocate funds. I would also point out that the Commission has proposed extending this deadline to seven years for the 2007–2013 period, as well as stipulating that if this rule is infringed in any way any funding granted must be returned, and that a company that has failed to comply with this condition once should be forbidden from obtaining any kind of funding in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a whole series of questions have been raised, such as the matter of a framework programme. It is quite clear that what the steel industry needs is innovative measures, and that this industry is a source of outstanding innovations, since metallurgical processes always involve the use of high technology. There is therefore no question that the steel industry will be allocated an appropriate place in the framework programme. There is much debate over the REACH directive, and while I do not believe that anyone is in any doubt as to whether consideration should be given to this directive, it is clear that it must be balanced and that it must be focused on its goals. The enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol can in any case be regarded as a success story for the European Union, and there can be no doubt that it is a major global success for the stability of our world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We began examining the problem of emissions trading a few days ago, and it will clearly be very important to evaluate all the findings and to formulate a position on processes that may on occasion be paradoxical in nature and have unintended side effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the steel industry is worthy of our attention, and restructuring, which is part of modern life, calls for a comprehensive European policy, the involvement of social partners and a desire to respond to these challenges. Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts undertaken by the Italian authorities. I believe that it is still possible to influence developments to a certain extent, and we shall respond to such developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
