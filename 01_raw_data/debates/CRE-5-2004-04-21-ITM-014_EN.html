<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we are going to begin with what I consider to be the soul of Europe, the most positive thing in Europe, which shows our citizens that they do exist, and which gives them a forum where they can express themselves in all their diversity. I believe that the European Cities of Culture, now to be called European Capitals of Culture, have in that sense, over the years, assumed great importance in the European cultural landscape. They are a shared cultural space. They show our diversities at their best.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the formula has developed over time: the scheme was launched in 1985 on the initiative of Melina Mercouri, and cities were originally designated by means of an inter-governmental process. We have come a long way since then, and the event has become a Community action following the 1999 decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The process is still developing, and it will go on developing. What we shall be looking at and deciding on today will be one stage in that development. Why will it be only one stage? It will be one stage because we are on the eve of a historic event which will change the destiny of the European Union. I am talking, of course, about enlargement, which ought to be taken into account when we are considering European Capitals of Culture, hence the Commission proposal which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this proposal is to allow the rapid integration of the new Member States into the ‘European Capital of Culture’ initiative. That does not mean that we do not have to think quickly about other changes which might prove necessary. Moreover, we are all in agreement on the fact that radical changes will have to be made to the current decision, and in any case we are already working on that. A study is in progress involving the European Capitals of Culture for the years 1995 to 2004. The results of that study, which will become known in the second half of 2004, will form the basis of our reflections and later, I presume, of the action we take to develop new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today we cannot make the new Member States wait any longer. They must be able to participate, like the others, in this action, which is so much appreciated. We must therefore give them the welcome that is their due. They have already made great efforts in order to obtain entry into the present Union. They cannot be kept out of the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event. The integration of the new Member States is already a priority, and it needs to be done very quickly. That is why the Commission wishes to separate the stage involving the integration of the new Member States from the debate on the need to remodel the whole procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore proposes, at this stage, simply to add the new Member States, by 2009, to the list drawn up by the decision, alongside the current Member States already designated, in alphabetical order. That order had already been decided, moreover, by a joint agreement between the Council and Parliament in 1999, and it is on that basis that the cities in question are currently preparing for the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus from 2009 onwards, two capitals will be designated each year, one for the current Member States and a second one for the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I can well understand Parliament’s desire to see the procedure improved. However, the way we are proceeding now is the only one which enables us to put the new Member States on an equal footing with the current Member States as far as the ‘European Capital of Culture’ scheme is concerned. We need to be aware that, if we omit this stage, and start straight away on a remodelling of the procedure, the new Member States will not be able to participate in the scheme until, at best, 2010 or 2011, or perhaps 2012, because it takes four years to prepare for the event, and the designations for 2008 will be made this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it will be for the new Parliament to decide on how to reform the procedure, because that procedure will in future involve twenty-five Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our position on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has preserved the purpose of the Commission’s proposal. However, it has expressed a wish to see, with effect from 2009, each Member State concerned, i.e. two per year, putting forward at least two cities as candidates for the title.</p>
<p class="contents">This is equivalent to a substantial amendment to the designation procedure and is therefore a change to the Commission’s proposal. That is why I cannot accept such a change from the point of view of the two-stage revision. Such an amendment actually belongs in the second phase, at which point we shall have the specific data necessary to complete the remodelling of that decision, in other words it will come later. In addition, the Commission feels obliged to reject Amendment No 2 by Parliament’s committee and, as a result, Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 as well, since they are the result of Amendment No 2.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Amendment No 1, which is concerned with adjusting the budget in the light of the fact that there will be at least two ‘Capitals’ per year, is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact we shall have to take into account this doubling of the number of cities involved when we come to evaluate any proposal for a programme to carry on from Culture 2000 with effect from 2007 onwards. Provision has, in fact, been made for funding in the context of that programme and not by virtue of the 1999 decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the Commission able to accept Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 tabled on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. These amendments would also make very radical changes to the designation procedure, a debate which will have to take place later.</p>
<p class="contents">There, ladies and gentlemen, you have what seems to me today to be a position that makes sense. I know that it was not easy to reach, because we would all like something better, including your Commissioner. In politics, however, one must be realistic, and if we want to make progress sometimes we have to move forward in small steps in order, finally, to achieve our objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has the honour to submit for debate, and then to a vote here in this House, a report about which there has been much discussion. It brings to a temporary conclusion an adventure which has been somewhat unhappy. It is a report on which your rapporteur is in the minority, so all I can do is to tell you its history. This is the first time, in the two and a half years during which I have been fortunate enough to work with Mrs Reding, that I find myself in disagreement with her – friendly disagreement, but very clear disagreement nevertheless. She is well aware of this. She has even alluded to it briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that every year one city in Europe should be the European Capital of Culture is an idea that originated with Melina Mercouri in 1985. At first, Mr President, that idea had a brilliant future, at a time when fierce competition brought together a number of candidate cities in a contest to win a single designation, and when a jury of experts gave its verdict on the real European interests of each of the plans of the candidate cities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the unfortunate Decision 1419 was proposed by the Council, supported by the Commission and approved by Parliament, and it governs, until 2019, as Mrs Reding has just reminded us, the list of Member States which, at the rate of just one per year, are responsible for proposing the European Capital of Culture. First of all, that decision takes no account of the fact that, even at the time, there was a prospect of the possible accession of at least ten new Member States, and the fact that it did not do so is unacceptable. Secondly, it left itself open to criticism, if not scandal, in both legal and political terms, since it practically prohibits the European Parliament in the next two legislative periods, i.e. those beginning in 1999 and 2004, from exercising, for five years, its powers to contribute towards the annual choice of the European Capital of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and this is at least as serious – although some Member States have submitted to the European institutions and the jury a list of two or three cities, thereby enabling a real choice to be made between them on the basis of the dynamism, innovation and European dimension of the projects, not all have done so. Member States’ recent choices have often related to a single city, chosen for reasons concerned with the local-election policies of the government currently in power, and without the city in question having shown any real interest in assuming this role. This amounts to forced labour, all the more so since assistance from the European budget for these activities represents less than 5% of the expenditure that they involve.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do, Mr President, is to start again from scratch. At the beginning of this debate, several months ago, my committee agreed unanimously with that. Mrs Reding was aware of it too, and she knows it is true as well as I do, even though she has just told us again that this will be something for a second stage, in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence shows that we need to revise the list and change the order after 2008, because it <span class="italic">was</span> possible, Commissioner, contrary to what you have just said, to integrate new Member States, provided that those Member States already designated for the years after 2009 would agree to a little delay. It was perfectly possible and it was very simple because, Mr President, it is essential to realise that a city needs five years in order to prepare itself. Obviously, therefore, it would be necessary to revise the list, change the order after 2008, reintroduce competition between cities and reinstate the importance of the role of the jury which, when there is only one ‘Capital’, obviously has no role at all and is no use for anything any more. It has, moreover, said as much, in writing, with delightful diplomatic acidity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council was watching and the Commission did not dare to confront it. Therefore you now have a proposal for a decision which I would describe as astounding and which consists of deciding that, with effect from 2009 and up to 2019, there will be two European Capitals of Culture per year – one in a current Member State and one in a new Member State – and it will still be the Member States who will designate the candidate cities, without their being under any obligation to submit alternative choices to the European institutions. Mrs Reding will even refuse an amendment by the PPE-DE Group, despite the fact that it was pushing in that direction. To choose two European Capitals of Culture a year at a time when the procedure is almost stifled is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. We shall simply make the dilution and obsolescence even worse. The jury still has no significance and the next two Parliaments are not allowed to participate in the selection process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s promise to submit to us, in autumn, a new draft decision amending this system, is merely a decoy. If we adopt this draft now, Commissioner, I do not see how, in autumn, we can go back on the date of 2019, the order in which Member States are listed and, above all, the fact that two capitals a year will be designated, leaving that task to the two Member States in question. I believe, moreover, that you will not be able to get the directive you have announced adopted, because you have become tangled up in the main substance of the problem. That is my prediction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council is watching and it has been using intimidation. The three Member States involved in the crucial period of 2009 to 2011, which are Austria, Germany and Finland, have been afraid that their designation will be called into question, though no one was actually thinking of this. The PPE Group has been taken in hand. We are faced with a decision which serves the prestige interests of our Member States, but surely not those of Europe, which would have been to revitalise and give back the sparkle to what was an excellent procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Anxious to keep the peace amongst us, and my personal friendship with Mrs Reding, I had proposed, and the Socialist Group had agreed with me, to accept our defeat at the committee stage and to decide not to put forward our amendments at the plenary session. After all, my mother brought me up properly and I am still a polite boy. However, our Green friends took up these amendments again, as is their right. You are therefore faced with two sets of amendments which are entirely incompatible. First of all there are the amendments of Socialist origin, though now supported by the Greens. These amendments are aimed at going back to the old system and to committing ourselves for the future only as far as 2010, reserving the right of the next Parliament to ask the Commission to propose, in autumn, a new list of Member States including the new ones, and to order those who can to organise a broad competition between cities, so that after some candidates have been eliminated the final decision is left to the jury of experts, which needs to be given that role if it is to be of any use, and to the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The other set of amendments, which comes mainly from the PPE Group, validates and sets out in detail the Commission’s proposal which, in my opinion, makes any decision this coming autumn completely pointless. This set of amendments, however, requires that those Member States which are able to should propose several cities – and, Mrs Pack, you have just heard that there will be no question of this, because Mrs Reding will be obliged, by the constraints under which she is suffering, to deny you this. This set of amendments claims to encourage competition between cities but it does not explain how, because it does not deal with the problem of the numerous smaller Member States which have only one important city, which would call for a revision of the list of Member States, which is something which will have to be done in the autumn.

<p class="contents">There you have it, Mr President: Members will vote according to their conscience. Once again, I would like to say that the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, is not as much to blame as the Council of Ministers, which is stifling the emergence of any truly European spirit and imposing a system whereby Member States set out their stalls displaying their national heritage and talents, while at the same time resolutely denying the authority of this Parliament. Faced with this situation, I have a feeling of relative sadness, but of course I am speaking as the defeated party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I could not give him the applause I would have liked to give. The fact is that I cannot act without thinking; I have to be guided by the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Capital of Culture that we are discussing today is something like a beacon of light in the small amount of cultural policy that we are allowed to deal with, so I am happy that we are carrying the torch onwards. The idea has been around for a long time now; it originated with a Greek lady Member of this House, and I think we can take pride in it. I also agree with Mr Rocard’s demand that the choice should be of at least two cities. It was after all we who introduced this idea, and I think, Commissioner, that it can be put into practice right now.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Capital of Culture, European diversity ought to be much more visible than it has been up to now, and so I do not think that these amendments run counter to what the Commissioner wants to do. I therefore ask her to consider whether she cannot perhaps incorporate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have to reiterate how much we all regret the Council of Ministers’ decision, none more than I, as I, back in 1999, was furiously angry about the Council of Ministers’ decision, seeing it as short-sighted and guided by national considerations. At the time, the Council of Ministers knew as well as we did that the European Union was going to be enlarged, and it showed that it did not give a damn about it, by naming only Western European cities right up to 2019. That is to the Council’s shame and not to our own, for we were bound by their decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision has been made, though, and, as they say where I come from, <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>! That is why we cannot change the fact that, up to 2019, the countries in question will also be entitled to propose cities. That is why, for the benefit of my German audience, I would like to say that Germany will be able to propose a city for 2010. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, though, endorse the Commissioner’s proposal for two Capitals of Culture, simply because the 10 new Member States cannot do anything about the shameless conduct of the old 15. It is now for the Commissioner to remedy that; she can do so by giving two cities the opportunity to present themselves to the world, and I do not believe it is so terrible that we should be doing this, if, for example, in 2010, we have one city from Germany and another from Hungary. I do not see that as such a bad idea. The two countries have marvellous things in common and the rivalries between them have been productive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one thing more: we may be 25 countries strong today, but there will be even more by 2019 – Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, not to mention the others. If we are allowed to name only one Capital of Culture, that means that each country would have a turn only once in a generation, and we cannot expect the public to put up with that. It is for that reason that I, like my group, support the Commissioner’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with my fellow-Members and with those who have spoken before me that the decision taken in 1999 was quite simply wrong. However much it took lead times, procedures for withdrawal, and so on, into consideration, this decision went too far. What was mistaken about it was not only its failure to take the future new Member States into account, but also the fact that it completely bypasses future Parliaments. Competition is necessary and rules are required if the expert jury is to be given an area of activity and a definite mandate, neither of which it has, unfortunately, had to date. If that is not done, the European Capital of Culture – at present a hallmark for cultural diversity and quality – will depreciate in value.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are in future to have two Capitals of Culture, that surely must not mean that, when giving them a financial basis, we split the existing grants in two, but rather that we double them. Anything else would make no sense at all. So I would urge that we do something about the financial basis, for two Capitals of Culture – if they are to put on a good programme – will need a great deal of support, quite apart from the enormous effort required of them and the amounts of money they themselves have to find. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no need to go into the appalling nature of the decision in 1999, which established selection entirely leaving out the ten countries that are joining us in less than a month. The solution proposed by the Commission, which aimed to split the procedure in two, would mean that for much too long a period – until 2019 – there would be two colleges, which is quite the opposite to integration. Integration does not mean continuing with two colleges within the Union and its selection and decision-making processes made up of old and new Member States. I think that this goes entirely against the desired objective, which we say is for them to become members. Therefore, and also for other reasons, I think it is wise to stop this in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The other reasons are linked to the evaluation that is taking place, which you mentioned, Commissioner. I think that the deviations that have been highlighted by Mr Rocard, which are linked to decisions that are far too motivated by self-interest, exploitative and for reasons of prestige or even less attractive reasons, even political reasons, have reduced the European quality of these events and that is what we need to discuss. This is the quality that the new selection process, which we say we want, needs to reaffirm, definitely through competition, also taking into account the events that are taking place at the moment, such as Lille 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The event is on the one hand very attractive and factual, with very interesting things to see, but at the same time there is a great frustration among those involved. Artists and those involved in culture are quick to point out that this event, which is mainly focused around factual matters, could devalue their work as artists, break down the relationship that there normally is with the public and result in fierce competition between cultural structures.</p>
<p class="contents">These collective comments from a network of cultural players and artists in a city or region where the ‘European Capital of Culture’ project is taking place, in Lille, should attract the attention and interest of the evaluation that is underway and encourage care. We should await the evaluation and try to find a selection and competition method that will promote adding value to Europe, as this is the challenge, to ensure that culture is valued across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gets Europe out of Brussels and Strasbourg and into the hearts and minds of people right across Europe. Cities compete to become the Capital of Culture - which is regarded as an accolade - and indeed they should.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain, Glasgow's time as the European Capital of Culture in 1990 was a real success story. Today it is the third most visited city in Britain. Glasgow's urban renaissance provided a blueprint for others and I am sure that Liverpool - the home of the Beatles as nobody needs reminding - will have great success during its year in 2008. As an MEP from the south-east of England, I am only sorry that our candidates of Canterbury, Brighton and Oxford were not chosen. Any one of them would have been a great Capital of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">As an English Conservative I have great respect for our French Socialist President of the Committee on Culture; I admire the first quality, I will excuse the second! In this instance I believe the majority in the committee was correct. It was too long to wait until 2019 for any of the accession states to have the opportunity to become a Capital of Culture. By sharing the list from 2009, when Lithuania will be the first of the accession states to get the opportunity, we will not detract from the principle: we will introduce the opportunity of cooperation across Europe, putting Europe back into the concept. That is something we can look forward to: cooperation is, after all, what Europe is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, we have to deal with what has to be called some kind of emergency solution or repair job. It has been said, and quite rightly, that it was utterly egoistic of the Council to come to a snap decision to make use of all the present Member States by 2019, in the full knowledge that we would have unification to deal with, in the shape of enlargement. Now that enlargement is imminent and it has dawned on some people that it cannot be right and proper to put these countries off until 2020 or even later, the Commission has now come up with this tandem solution– and a solution it is, although I have to tell you, Commissioner, that it does of course leave a disagreeable aftertaste. I think you are aware of that too. I will readily concede, though, that you have tried to make the best of it, and it really is a great shame that we in this House are in two minds about it and that opinions differ on it, with the result that the proposals Mr Rocard has made in his report on the qualitative improvement of the selection procedure cannot be discussed in isolation from the question of what actually happens if fundamental changes are made.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a German MEP. In Germany, 17 cities are seeking to be the Capital of Culture for 2010. We are told that nobody wants to interfere with this. What legal certainty, though, is there for these cities if the procedure cannot be completed? They have applied and are engaged in a contest that I believe can point the way ahead. The only real recommendation I can make for the future is that a competition be held within the Member States, with the Member State making a qualitative decision, which would then be taken up to European level, where I would like to see a competitive selection procedure. I hope that the new Parliament can do some fundamental new thinking about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, though, I think we should do everything possible to make the best of it, in the interests of the countries concerned and, above all, of European culture. Much as I would, theoretically speaking, have preferred our Chairman’s clear and purist solution, I nevertheless think it is now time to turn the tables. We should now see this necessary solution not as an emergency measure but as a positive opportunity to set forth Europe’s cultural diversity by having not just one Capital of Culture, but – and why ever not? – two capitals for this great Europe of ours, embracing for the first time East and West and symbolising our cultural diversity. There must then be no distinction between old and new Member States; there must be two equal cities, symbolising the cultural diversity of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What will then be important is that the concept, the vision, that underlies the concept of a European Capital of Culture should play more of a role. This should not just be about cities depicting themselves and their splendid history, their past and their present, but about them putting on show the way in which European history has been made and today’s Europe shaped by them. From this point of view, I do see the resolution we are now adopting as being – if you go back to its origins – a great opportunity for Europe’s cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And as a person from outside who can perhaps comment with fewer political implications, I would like to say that culture is very broad, it has many facets and that two European capitals is not excessive. In sport we have two Olympic games, in winter and in summer, within the same year, and no harm is done. Culture is perhaps even broader and we cannot deny the new countries which are going to join us the opportunity to organise and hold a European capital of culture in one of its cities. I personally and my group therefore support the Commission’s position of naming two cities as European capitals of culture.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of how to select them, we believe that competition should prevail.

We have done some good work over the last few years. I regret that it has to end on a disagreement. We do not, however, disagree on the fundamental issue, because we have the same fundamental idea: to ensure that European capitals of culture continue to be real springboards for European cultures and diversity. Unfortunately, the fact that the Treaties require unanimity in cultural matters does not allow us to go any further, which is what we really need to do. This is why, while we hope to soon have a new treaty establishing majority decisions on cultural matters, which would help us enormously to make progress in many areas, we should propose a radical review as soon as possible of the way in which European capitals of culture are chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things that I would like to say. The first is that I agree with those of you who have said that a repair solution may be an opportunity for the future. Often, in the past, European capitals of culture have not been European enough. If we have two capitals between which bridges are built, there could be a very significant strengthening of that European dimension. I must also assure you that this Commissioner has his pilgrim’s stick ready to go to the cities when they are being prepared, to argue the cause of a more European programme. I think that the last three examples, Graz, Genoa and Lille, to name but a few, show a remarkable effort to place the European aspect of culture on the agenda, transcending regional and national dimensions. I am therefore optimistic, because I am speaking on the basis of what is being done.</p>
<p class="contents">There are even some Member States already doing what we want for the future: healthy competition in order to choose the best city. What is happening is England, Germany and elsewhere is marvellous. We are also aware, of course, that there are negative examples, but today I prefer to look mainly at the positive examples, because they are marvellous and they show us that the capitals of Europe are a good idea with a great future ahead of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I attach huge importance to the bridges to be built between the cities. For example, look at the Luxembourg proposal, which raised a few problems, because it was not sufficiently developed. The jury protested. Luxembourg submitted a new plan which creates synergies within the big region of Europe, i.e. Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and France, and also creates synergies with a Romanian city which, historically, has a specific relationship with Luxembourg. They even still speak Luxembourgian there. This is to show you that if we are really doing our job and pushing the cities to be better, to be really European in their cultural choices, the result can be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who have cited some cities to show how becoming European capitals of culture opened up new perspectives to them by directing them towards cultural industries, cultural tourism and cultural excellence. This is the case of a city such as Glasgow, for example, which was not really oriented towards culture at the start. The same applies to Liverpool. These cities are experiencing a development that is not only industrial and social, but also involves citizens and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">If we work hard in the future, like the current Parliament, for whom this is the last debate on culture, has done over the last five years, I do not doubt for a moment, Chairman Rocard, that what your Committee wanted and what your Commissioner has always advocated will be put into practice in the cities of culture of the future. I hope that the good examples of the past will be followed in the future, and I wish all citizens and all those involved in culture courage and pleasure as they meet in the future in the cultural cities of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
