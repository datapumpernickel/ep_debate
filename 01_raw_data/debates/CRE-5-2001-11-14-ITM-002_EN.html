<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caudron (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin my speech as general rapporteur for the Sixth Framework Programme on Research, I must first express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have helped me in this difficult task. As you know, this is an important programme. It has a provisional budget of EUR 17.5 billion, including Euratom. I would like to thank the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the European Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Westendorp, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the ITER Committee, the administrators of the different groups, my assistant Gaëlle Le Bouler, the shadow rapporteurs of the ITER Committee, the draftsmen of the opinion, the shadow draftsmen of the committees consulted and the group coordinators.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that I am now in a position to declare that together we have completed a truly remarkable task. I am sure you will all agree with me on this. You will express your view when we vote. I am sure that the result will not be the same as the outcomes of the votes on the Fourth, and especially the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the results of our work can largely be attributed to two guiding principles. Firstly, in my capacity as rapporteur I have always wanted to be the representative and spokesman for a broad majority in Parliament. In addition, Commissioner Busquin was, from the start, willing to support the framework and the overall budget of the project. In addition to this support, we have received many proposals for adjustment. These have resulted from our wide-ranging consultation with the European research sector, European politicians and all the organisations and citizens with an interest in the European research sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I can personally list more than 250 meetings, talks and discussions on this project and this report since the beginning of 2001. Furthermore, I have tried to ensure transparency during work on this project. I have published all available information and views on the subject in real time on my website. In recent months, this website has been visited more than 3 000 times per month, excluding the summer holiday period.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, all of us, myself included, have agreed to set up a genuine European Research Area and all the necessary structures, including the Joint Research Centre, on the basis of the Framework Programme on Research and Development. We have agreed too that we need to act upon the idea of European added value, as proposed by the European Commission. But, at the same time, we have all declared that we should take into consideration another aspect of added value: the added value of giving research a European dimension. This supplements the accounting added value of the European Commission. As I have already said, we should not allow there to be any perception or feelings of exclusion, and we should back researchers who believe that their work needs to be carried out at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">All this translates into two new, secondary priorities. Firstly, there is the fight against major diseases. This goes hand-in-hand with research on the human genome, with its anticipated results for health. Secondly, we need to consider terrestrial and maritime transport. The objectives here are to improve links between different means of transport, and to improve flexibility, security, efficiency, and coherence. In this regard, the quality and improvement of the environment are important considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the functioning of the framework programme is concerned, there are proposals to ensure that there is a smooth transfer between the old instruments of the Fourth and Fifth Framework Programmes and the Commission’s three new instruments. In addition, there is the fourth ‘stairway of excellence’ instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, all this translates into a compromise on the specific programmes involved. The proposal is for a single programme with eight sub-programmes. This will increase coherence while providing sufficient scope for participation and adequate control. There are also specific measures to improve professional life and mobility for researchers, while taking account of the requirement to strengthen the role of micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Euratom section, the majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also agreed on the principles and the structure of the Commission’s text, especially regarding the need to ensure security of energy supply, risk reduction, and the processing of nuclear waste. Lastly, the majority of the Committee on Industry agreed on the importance of research on nuclear fusion. They also agreed on the need to construct an experimental reactor soon, and for it to be located in Europe if possible. This is necessary so that we may have some chance of meeting our energy requirements in fifty years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today establish a firm and sound position after our first reading. I am delighted that progress has not been hindered by what occurred on Monday evening. The situation where the adoption of my reports would have been dependent on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has been avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">By midday I hope that we will also reach agreement on ethical rules and on stem cell research on supernumerary embryos. The vote today could also benefit the debate and votes to be held on the Fiori report during the November sitting in Brussels. In this, we must be guided by common sense and tolerance and respect the views of others.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the votes held by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 16 and 22 October has already been noted by the ‘Research’ Council of 30 October, judging by its final communiqué. A new ‘Research’ Council will publish its common position next December. I hope it will then be possible, through the codecision procedure, we will be able to reach a common decision by favouring informal discussions. I would not like to place a bet on our not needing to resort to conciliation. We might or we might not. However, I would like to reiterate this point: the sooner we finish our work in 2002, the sooner partners working in the research sector will be able to prepare and so ensure the best possible transition to the Fifth Framework Programme. Also, the sooner we finish our work, the sooner we will be able to develop international partnerships with candidate countries and associated countries, and pursue all our other international ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish where I began, by thanking all those involved in this splendid project. I call on the Commission and the Council to listen to us, and, more importantly, to ensure that they understand us. Our demands are not unrealistic; neither are we engaged in politics here. They are proposals by European citizens, considered and debated at length. We therefore call for them to be studied. Further work will of course need to be undertaken when it comes to the final agreement, but for the moment we simply need to be free to define our own position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by reminding you of an objective set in January. We set out to turn this work into an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate to strengthen the important link between science and society. We set out to convince people that, although science does not have all the answers, we cannot hope to tackle the world’s greatest problems without science, research and researchers. I hope that our work will have made a positive contribution in this regard. I also hope that it will provide the Commission and the Council with proposals from the European research sector which will form the basis of a Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development for Europe in 2002. I really believe we should call it the Sixth Framework Programme. The programme will be innovative, realistic, and effective. It will be a firm foundation for the development of the European research sector, a sector we all support.</p>

He has really tried to make a reality of the wide-ranging citizens' debate of which he speaks. He has tried to involve many people, within and outside Parliament, and in research circles, in order to have an intelligent discussion here and prepare a good compromise. From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, I must say, I support the rapporteur, but I am being pulled in two directions, because I at the same time have to announce that my group has misgivings and will not vote in favour of this resolution in its entirety. I am here, then, primarily playing my role as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. It has to be said on this point that the budget for this Sixth Research Framework Programme ranges between the right limits. A slight increase was achieved, but at the same time the allocation was not exceeded, in other words the programme is, in budgetary terms, within proper and sensible limits. I think we can achieve real European added value with this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We also had discussions with the Commission about possible simplification of the procedure, that also being one of our Committee's concerns, so that approval might be granted more quickly. The Commission has made good proposals on this point, and we are very confident that this speeding-up of procedures can be achieved in order that the partners in projects can access their funds more quickly. At the same time, our side urged once more that proper account should be taken of the smaller project partners and that smaller projects should not fall by the wayside in a slimmed-down procedure, because it is in the sphere of the smaller projects that a lot of important work has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one bitter pill for our group above all others to swallow, and that is the issue of renewable energies and the issue of the Euratom resources. Speaking from my group's point of view, I have to say that we have problems with the fact that renewable energies have not been developed as they should have been, and that too much has been approved, especially in the fusion field.</p>

His report provides a balanced discussion of all the main arguments on which the European institutions should concentrate their attention as regards scientific research and the potential for technological and social development. The Committee on Freedoms particularly stresses the need for the public promotion of research to be done with the greatest possible transparency and involvement of the citizens. A European knowledge-based society, like the one the Union is proposing, requires not only huge-scale initiatives in literacy, including scientific literacy, for all the citizens but also an increasingly intense, active involvement of the citizens in decisions regarding the direction that investment in this field should take.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-specialist citizens, in other words, should not just enjoy or, as is often the case, suffer the results achieved by science, but should also join with the experts in deciding on the objectives that research should pursue. We believe the validity of a European science policy should be measured especially on this criterion. The Caudron report quite rightly addresses these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Caudron report also invokes the transparent and democratic nature of decisions on scientific research when, instead of invoking principles of natural law, which are, in fact, only held by certain authorities, it refers, in the case of the ethical problems of research, to charters of rights, the documents which have effectively been approved and sanctioned by our Institutions. This means, for instance, in the field of stem cell research, respecting the feelings of a large number of European citizens by ruling out the production of stem cells for research, but allowing research to be conducted on those supernumerary cells that would otherwise be destroyed. On this and other matters I believe we should go with the Caudron report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, research projects today often do not achieve the hoped-for success which would allow them to compete at an international level, and the European Union does not hold enough attraction to lure back the top researchers who have chosen to work abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The new scheme should bring in some changes: firstly, concentrate financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority subjects for Europe; secondly, invite researchers to collaborate more closely; and thirdly, increase the mobility of researchers by creating a working environment in Europe that is attractive to them. These priorities form the framework for the 42 amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, many of which have been incorporated, for which I thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is competent in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments concern employment, health and safety at work, access to work for the disabled, small and medium-sized enterprises and European Community research centres. With regard to employment, we have seen an amendment adopted which seeks to extend research to the development of operating systems and computer hardware in Europe in order to increase employment and stop us from being so heavily dependent on the United States and Japan in this area. This is a key sector for the new economy and would entail considerable risks for the sake of economic and employment growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we asked for action in the field of health and safety at work, in order to encourage access for the socially excluded and disadvantaged, such as people with disabilities. Research support for small and medium-sized enterprises has also been accepted with very favourable terms, it has gone up from 15 to 30 %, and the same may be said of support for JRCs, which are to receive EUR 725 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I must move in favour of approval, since science and research are there to serve the people, for that right to life that no one is entitled to jeopardise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have submitted many proposals on sustainable development, food safety and other subjects, which were, thankfully, generally adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We focused on medical research, as we believed that it was in this area that there was the greatest need for change to the Commission's proposal. The Commission's suggestion that only biotechnology should be promoted in the health context is too narrow. Other research fields, too, promise much for health and need to be supported. I thank Mr Caudron, the rapporteur, for his commitment to this as well, and also the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr van Velzen, for whom this was also a matter for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us as regards the ethical boundaries of medical research. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy spoke out clearly in favour of research and for the curing of illnesses, but also in favour of clear boundaries for the sake of human dignity. In particular, our Committee demands the exclusion of exploitative research on human embryos from the research framework programme. This ban is necessary not just because human life is involved, but also because we must counteract the danger of the female body being seen as raw material for industry. Embryo research is not possible without women's egg cells being made available, and the donation of egg cells puts a woman under great strain and at medical risk. It is for this reason that many feminists, too, are opposed to exploitative embryo research.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us down this road, and so, together with Mr Fiori, I have tabled an amendment that follows the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is also taken in the United States. 'Yes' to stem cell research, but 'no' to exploitative embryo research. The Americans can be accused of many things, but not of being hostile to research. I therefore ask for support for Amendment No 332, tabled by Messrs Fiori, Liese and others.</p>

The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport welcomes it for a number of reasons. It particularly welcomes the fact that the report deals with a number of matters which concern our committee. These include the technology and methods used to convert products and works into a digital format, the protection and development of our historic and cultural heritage. We are also pleased that it deals with drug taking, as our committee is also responsible for youth and sports. Other areas of concern contained in the report include the history of Europe, distance learning and mobility for researchers. I regret that digital cinema, the cinema of tomorrow, has disappeared from this list. It might have required specific research. I hope that specific programmes will be able to make good this omission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I am delighted the life sciences have been recognised as a scientific subject and are not regarded simply as an instrument for other sciences. The life sciences constitute a distinct discipline and the fact that the Sixth Framework Programme has recognised this is a great step forward. Perhaps the first title of the seventh thematic area: ‘Cultural and social research’ was the most appropriate. I am sorry it has been changed to ‘Citizens, democracy, social and political institutions’. I think the first title was better. If we had used the title ‘Cultural and social research’, it might have been easier to include research on women, and not just research carried out by women, as in the paragraph ‘Science and society’. Mr Caudron, I regret the fact that research ‘on women’ and the thinking included in your intermediary reports were not retained in its final version.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish on this point. I have been involved in drawing up reports which have gradually transformed the notion of centres of excellence. The latter became the stairway of excellence. We, the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, were very concerned that research should not be confined to an elite. Rather, when it comes to building the European Research Area, research should be shared amongst younger researchers, a range of relevant institutions, and universities. I note that there have been adjustments here too. I am glad that the paragraph ‘Science and society’ has doubled. The matter of research ‘by women’ is at the heart of this paragraph. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has an interest in this subject, but so does the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport<span class="italic">.</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Concentration on other topics has meant, as Mrs Fraisse has already explained, that there has been less research into gender issues and less emphasis upon opening science and research to the full range of people with the right potential. In 1999, 66% of the research workers in the State sector and 72% of those in higher education were men. In only a few countries did the proportion of women exceed 40%, and that was in Ireland and Greece. Only in Portuguese higher education, with 53%, was a balance achieved. Women are particularly underrepresented, at 9%, in academic teaching posts in Germany. The highest levels were in Finland with 36%. It is therefore in the European interest and adds value if women are involved in research and teaching at every stage, from planning, via decision-making to project management, as well as in EU initiatives for prizes and competitions in all disciplines.</p>
<p class="contents">I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the McNally Report on women and science, and, in order to implement it, the Commission set up a Gender Unit, which now has some early successes to show. Focused efforts have achieved a percentage of nearly 40% of women involved in the EU's research bodies and the same proportion receiving Marie Curie scholarships. We must, then, build on the successes of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, one contribution to which might be the doubling of the budget in the 'Science and Society' subdivision, and here, too, there is a need for research into gender issues.</p>
<p class="contents">One final remark: In my language, the entire draft has to be revised in gender-neutral language, because we are setting the course for the future, above all for young women scientists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have found an innovative method, for which we are very grateful. Needless to say, that also applies to the shadow rapporteurs, Messrs McNally, Piétrasanta and Plooij-van Gorsel. We worked well together. I should also like to extend a word of thanks to my own fellow MEPs who have invested a huge amount of energy in this dossier. This is truly a joint outcome, and I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, is prepared to take this outcome seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we have developed a structure by means of which, within the restricted margins available to us, everything has become clearer. More emphasis has been placed on bio-sciences; a better link has been established between research on the human genome and related diseases; far more attention has been devoted to a coherent package of industrial policy, information society, nanotechnoloy, as well as aviation and aerospace. Additionally, food safety has been accorded considerably more attention. Furthermore, unlike the Commission, we have given transport a much higher place in our list of priorities, alongside more attention for energy. Agriculture is also more involved. In my view, the package is looking better now all in all.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget is also of major importance in my opinion. We have expressly adhered to our pledge to the Council that we would not increase the budget. We have slightly shifted the priorities. We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council to accept our budget now and not to start bargaining, for we will then have a war on our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we should be emphatically aware that although the EU’s contribution to research in the Member States carried out by the national governments and industry is limited, it is still of fundamental importance. If, specifically, the EU can play a complementary role, the added value will be significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Not for nothing did we include a fourth instrument to guarantee the smoothest possible transition between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programme and to allow minor projects too to take place. More than 15% has been set aside for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and that too is one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The decentralisation of the Sixth Framework Programme is important, but it is just as important not to weigh down the newly integrated projects, <span class="italic">centres of excellence</span>, with an enormous amount of red tape. That is why I believe our amendments are excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: we have struggled greatly with the ethical principles. Indeed, on the one hand, it is important to create a framework within which research is to take place, but on the other hand, it is important, by means of further research, to create space for solutions to be found for existing illnesses with a genetic hereditary factor. Our greatest challenge was to strike that balance, and I hope that we have succeeded in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area, which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy, because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success – inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia, I should say.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value, not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out. So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research, particularly in areas like nano-technology, which will be very significant in the future. There are, however, some gaps in the proposals which we wish to see filled. They include, of course, health, other than strictly post-genomic research, non-nuclear energy and land and water transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to international activities, because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well. It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research – we suggest EUR 400 million – and mainstreaming across all the research, particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis. We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research. The sums allocated in the Commissioner's proposal for science and society were inadequate. We propose to double the spending on science and society.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring. I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects, we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages. We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels. I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC. I served on Mr Davignon's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel's views.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view – this is not the view of the rapporteur – is that extra funding is not therefore needed. It will be available in any case. The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union. Let us build on their past success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Gérard Caudron. He listened attentively to all the political groups and to the shadow rapporteurs, and others. We have worked very well together. I believe that he did everything he could have done. Although there have been differences of opinion on some conclusions, the work was completed to a high standard. My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment, despite its faults. It has European added value, it is innovative as the Commissioner wished, it has networks of excellence and integrated projects. We have a lot to do. We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people, grants and women and preventing brain drains. We cannot ignore all the innovative proposals in the Sixth Framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three issues of great concern to the Greens. Firstly, the ethical questions. We do not want the European Union to fund the modification of the human genetic inheritance and the creation of human embryos for therapeutic reasons. We also want to see a ban on financing research using supernumerary human embryos and the stem cells of supernumerary embryos. From what I have heard, I think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies, like electromagnetic radiation for example, on populations, on health and so on. Thirdly, we would like to achieve a fairer balance between research on renewable energies and research on nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate the sentiments of Eryl MacNally. We do not want to see an increase in the nuclear energy or the ITER project budgets. That is very long term. We would however like research credits for renewable energy to be more on a par with those for nuclear energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a good few of our members who have genuinely attended to this issue, who are on the way here to our debate today but who will not perhaps be in time for the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally believe that we shall be adopting too many amendments. If we examine research programmes and research issues, there is scarcely any research programme in the whole of Europe that is so driven by politicians. That is in total contrast to, for example, the assessment made by Manuel Castells – yes, it is legitimate to call him a sociologist – together with the Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen as to why Finland is successful as an information society. In their perhaps otherwise rather vague book, they observe that our technology and innovation policy are successful because we have a complete and autonomous centre for technical development. That is something which I think invites reflection. In other contexts, it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy. I think that a certain lesson can be drawn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I want to emphasise an aspect of this proposal that particularly bothers me, namely that the social research proposed would certainly be allocated to the wrong place, under the Information Society DG. Social research does not belong in that context. I do not properly understand how this has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that interest in research issues has, to a very large extent, revolved around stem cell research. Today, we can adopt a position on the Caudron proposal in peace and quiet. I personally view the committee’s proposal as being well balanced. The committee’s proposal also shows the modesty and respect that is required when we debate research issues. I think that those who say that we should now concentrate first and foremost upon stem cells from adults are not showing the required modesty faced with this new area. In the course of the work in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, I learned that we know extremely little. We must adhere to the old principles and proceed further within the various frameworks. Furthermore, I learned that the research projects for both forms of stem cells are dependent upon each other. It must therefore be possible for them to be given the same priority. That, I believe, is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead as a successful society.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these comments are not too alarming, but that they lead to reflection on the part of all who are interested in our researchers’ really being able to carry out good research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The size of this sum indicates how significant the matter in question now is. Codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament. In this matter it is particularly well-founded. There are good grounds to support Mr Caudron’s model on programme coordination and administration as well as informing and listening to Parliament in decision-making at levels more detailed than that of the framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary research areas selected by the Commission are well-founded as are also Parliament’s complementary priorities, which are not all mere information technology and artificial intelligence. The health of a human being depends on what he eats. It is justified to use funds to research the whole of the food chain. The new biotechnology involves the ethical foundations of all kinds of life, and therefore technology must also be complemented by results from human sciences. Science must not be dependent on the ethics of big corporations, and that is why it must receive public funding.</p>
<p class="contents">When the health of the environment depends greatly on energy production, several adjustments made by Parliament endeavour to improve the research into new forms of energy. It would be justified to direct more funds into the research of fusion energy than what the Commission is proposing. There is need to build a new Tokamak for the joint use of all Member States and Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Russia. When funding is cut, this important project is delayed, further delaying the opportunity to produce energy by fusion power, which even in the current circumstances is going to be postponed by as much as fifty years.</p>
<p class="contents">When the framework programme was drawn up, not enough attention was paid to the activities of the Joint Research Centre of the EU. It will also use scientific resources. During the coming five-year period its position within the research community of the EU and its Member States must be clarified; research resources must not be wasted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes, such as Leader, have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification, quality and consumer satisfaction. How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming? Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability, quality and competitiveness. What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE? Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control?</p>

Controversial activities should not receive active support from the Union. Moreover, the community of values which, after all, the EU aspires to achieve, will definitely be at risk. Intervening in life created by God is non-negotiable. That must be the basic principle. In this light, the funding of research activities on surplus embryos with Community money cannot be justified in any way. Citizens would then be forced to contribute towards research which is punishable in a Member State such as Germany and which a number of national parliaments have declared themselves openly against.</p>
<p class="contents">Neighbouring countries of a Member State which apply less stringent rules find themselves facing a related dilemma. A shift of European research to the relevant Member State undermines the effectiveness of the rules. A situation should not, however, arise in which ethical differences are exploited as a competitive factor. That could also lead to a brain drain. In this respect, the establishment of one European Research Area will function as a catalyst. That is why I make a serious appeal to you to support my amendments. They aim to prevent this. Europe must commit to finding a solution to this pending cross-border issue. Has the Commission looked into this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, within the research framework of cross-border problems, it is not funding but cooperation which deserves a central role. The funding of research into surplus embryos only complicates this cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two points cause me concern. The first is that, when it comes to the definition of fundamental ethical principles, the mind of this House is divided between, on the one hand, banning embryo stem cell research outright and, on the other, permitting it.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the boundary lies between a mere heap of cells and a human life is something we all no doubt have to decide for ourselves. It is a choice with far-reaching implications, one to be made on the basis of conscience. I would remind you, though, that research on embryo stem cells is prohibited in several Member States, including Austria. To use EU funds to finance research in one Member State which would be banned in another is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that concerns me is that research funds totalling EUR 1.2 billion are being made available within the framework of the Euratom programme, over two-thirds of which go to nuclear research. Safety issues play only a subordinate role. I consider increased research into non-nuclear energy sources to be imperative.

I should like to draw your attention to the pioneering area of research into the human genome. This research is expected to have future applications in four areas of medicine: first, hereditary illnesses, secondly, the most common fatal illnesses, namely cancer, cardio-vascular and degenerative neural illnesses, thirdly, an understanding of the mechanics of various illnesses, which will lead to new, more efficient treatment and drugs and, fourthly, the prevention of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live, thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the illnesses which I have already mentioned. Stem cell research may well have new applications in treating illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, leukaemia and many others.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical problems. This was the point of the amendment which I tabled together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Purvis. This amendment will allow the pioneering research which I have described to progress while striking the balance needed in order to avoid ethical problems. So we can look forward to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises. I trust that the European Parliament will support the line being marked out and strike the right balance between progress and ethical considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several of us Members have been concerned about the possibilities of SMEs to participate in the framework programme, because the Commission’s original proposal does not make these opportunities concrete enough. The Commission proposes so-called horizontal activities, in which it will be very difficult for small and medium-size enterprises to participate, at least at the initial stages. Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take. The same applies to preparation funds. Enterprises have already become used to these measures, which have produced plenty of good results. Why should a good arrangement be abolished? Amendment No 265 concerns this matter. A share of 15% funding from enterprises has been proposed. Also this fact must be made concrete in the actual guideline funding schedules, when decisions on them are made at a later stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this was undermined in committee by what Mr Van Velzen has already referred to as the joint result. The proposals on health and transport emerged very much weakened. Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport. It is not their priority.</p>
<p class="contents">On ethics in biotechnology, the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings. This is unacceptable to mainstream science. The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">On stem cell research, the production of human embryos for research is unacceptable and it is very unacceptable to most of our citizens as well. The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate. However, amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House, otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards GMOs and plant genetics, the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers, quite contrary to what many want. This is again a recipe for conflict and it was not in the Commission's proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding energy, equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required. We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy. This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens. If we are not to have a conflict between science and society, which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid, we will need to revise these priorities. For example, proposals on fusion are out of date. Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the weak points identified in research in the European Union is its poor application and yet the European Commission's proposed overall budget does not respond to the need for a bold increase in funding and, unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, despite proposing research activities, has not increased the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point is orientation. The draft before us leaves little room for free research which may not bring in results which can be directly applied in practice but which helps to increase our knowledge and acts as a basis for future applications. This being so, we feel that the Committee on Industry's proposal to reduce expenditure on so-called priority 8 is not a move in the right direction. This does not, of course, mean that we disagree with the seven thematic priorities proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The third major issue is who is to benefit from funding. The structure of the proposed programme is such that it benefits companies, both directly and indirectly, because the guidelines are tailored to their needs. In our view, corporate research should be funded from company profits, not the public purse. We are also afraid that small research teams will have trouble finding funding, although the Committee on Industry's amendments will help here.</p>
<p class="contents">One comment on the Euratom programme: whatever our reservations about the safety of nuclear fission, we need to be equally hopeful that the continuing debate will provide a long-term solution to the energy supply problem. From this point of view, I welcome the fact that the Committee on Industry has recommended an increase in funding for the ITER reactor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what worries me is that the so-called ethical issue has become much more important than it deserves and has even had a disorientating effect. Public funding for research is no way to resolve this sort of problem. It would be a serious oversight on my part if I failed to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff and, of course, our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and all the shadow rapporteurs on their tremendous work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR 400 million have been set aside for this purpose, but the money appears in the budget under ‘integration of European research’ in Amendment No 339. Could the Commission please tell me whether this means that the money can only be spent in Europe or whether it is possible to use this money to finance the pan-African malaria vaccine-testing network, which, unlike the EU, is ready to test the malaria vaccine now?</p>
<p class="contents">If the EUR 400 million can only be spent in Europe, can the Commission tell me whether mainstreaming will make it possible to fund the African network?

<p class="contents">We are discussing a research programme which will end in 2006. By then, if we do not finance the pan-African network, more than 400 million people may have died in sub-Saharan Africa and in other poor countries, and more than 50 years of development policy efforts are likely to be ruined by then.

The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is of crucial importance for the Member States and for the Union as a whole. Research ought to be aimed at development. This is how we must follow up the declarations made at the Lisbon European Council. We were charged with turning the European Union into the most dynamic and successful economy in the world, whilst also aiming at full employment. After all, what use would research be if we did not make that our common aim? In my view, the preparation and adoption of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development provides the ideal opportunity to implement this conclusion of the Lisbon Summit and to give substance to the European Charter for small enterprises. Enterprises play an important role in disseminating scientific innovation. I am therefore delighted that substantial resources, substantial compared to the immense requirements of other areas, have been devoted to growing businesses, especially small businesses and craft industries. We must support and encourage research and innovation in SMEs, and also facilitate access to the best technologies, including those of the traditional sector too. It will then be possible for the enterprises to respond to the challenge of full employment. I should, however, like to refer in particular to the biotechnology industry, to which we must pay special attention because it is involved with the science of living beings. Regardless of the stage of its development, no human being, whether an embryo or an adult, should ever be used as material with which to treat another human being. Funding research into embryo stem cells or supernumerary embryos would be contrary to the principle of human dignity. This principle is affirmed in several of the founding texts of the European Union and more recently, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, such research is now no longer required because encouraging results have been obtained through the use of adult stem cells to treat incurable diseases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Genetic research promises much in preventing and curing many of man's most dreaded hereditary diseases. But genetic engineering for this purpose must not extend into eugenics. Embryo research must not lead to the deliberate creation of embryos for research, though we may accept that early stage supernumerary embryos genuinely resulting from in-vitro fertilisation, from spontaneous miscarriages or from therapeutic abortions for the mother's health, and which are destined for destruction in any case, can legitimately and ethically be available for research in Member States where there is strict regulation and supervision.</p>

The EUR 17.5 billion are in my view insufficient, above all when you consider the ambitious goals that Europeans are always setting themselves. It is certainly far too little when you consider the imminent enlargement of the European Union. These funds are one day to be invested for 25 or even more Member States, and that is not enough. That, though, is how things are these days. I hope in any case that the Council will approve at least these EUR 17.5 billion, or else, and here I agree with Mr van Velzen, there will be trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">European research policy is very much seen in terms of participation in the research programmes. I want to vigorously urge the Commission to do everything possible to make the submission of applications and their processing easier, so that the researchers can spend their time on real research rather than on filling in forms.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation is on fusion. We wrangle about this over and over again, and I respect the different opinions that are held on the subject. The only thing I cannot accept is that this research will not bear fruit for a very long time. We urge the young to start early on providing for old age, even though, from a young person's point of view, old age is a long, long way away. We are talking here about the same sort of provision. Whether a fusion power station is eventually built or not, is for those who come after us to decide. We should, however, give them the option.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always considered it very important that the European Union should concern itself with highly sensitive questions that had formerly been beyond our scope, for example, new methods of detecting and removing landmines. It is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years, and it has achieved noteworthy successes. My heartfelt plea is that this programme should be continued, ambitiously developed and coordinated, if possible, by a single office within the Commission. I am thinking here of the Joint Research Centre, whose achievements to date deserve to be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">An attempt is similarly being made, incidentally, to involve European Union research in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological or chemical. I would remind you that the Commission will be making a statement this afternoon about the banning of biological weapons, which has to do with the fight against terrorism. In the former Soviet Union, today, there are still enormous stockpiles of biological and chemical agents that cannot be destroyed for lack of the necessary funds and often also of the necessary technology. This is an opportunity for the European Union to do something for the security of Europe and of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as bioethics is concerned, I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which simply takes account of the different understandings of the law on this subject in the Member States, and we as European legislators cannot supplant the Member States on this point. Such a respect for sovereignty is reflected in this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Busquin, the Sixth Framework Programme has the great ambition of establishing a European Research Area, and I truly hope that the small, yet excellent, research teams which we even have in the more peripheral regions will be able to play a role in this. In European research, we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking. Female researchers must have a part to play in this and in the next few years, forge ahead to take up leading positions in the research programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Research which attempts to solve the mysteries of life remains important. That is not only applied research, but also fundamental research. There is no doubt that bio-genetics will create new opportunities in future in the fight against incurable diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and some forms of cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the parameters set out in the Caudron report, particularly in Amendment No 22, and under strict ethical supervision, including that of parliaments, we are of the view that it must be possible to finance stem cell research within the Member States’ legal framework. It is of the utmost importance for us to outline this ethical framework and for the European Parliament and the Member State parliaments to follow the developments in this field, for we must avoid at all cost that everything is allowed for some, as long as it is commercially viable, while nothing is allowed for others. We must be led by our conscience to jointly outline this framework, even if we fail to see eye to eye on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The task is significant because it opens new horizons for European research. This is sorely needed, because our research is stagnating, our continent and our Union are not at the cutting edge. By this, I mean scientific research and research in many other essential fields, not only scientific progress, but also employment, which are beneficial to the economy and to the progress of human kind.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, we are particularly pleased with the position adopted by the Committee on Industry regarding research into human genetics. Tremendous progress has been made everywhere and more is being achieved every day. Researchers and scientists are working away in laboratories. They are responsible individuals, not at all unbalanced, as many believe. They hope very soon to make it possible for untold millions of human beings to escape a dreadful fate. These people would then be able to resume a normal life and regain their dignity as human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease constitute vast research areas still to be explored. I have in mind stem cell research in particular. The Caudron report presents us with this new challenge, which is dealt with in depth. Since Galileo, ever since time began in fact, scientific progress has always challenged the established order. Indeed, given that it ushers in a new order, the one previously in place is bound to collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, certain Members of this House have voiced their opposition to all this. They are trying to prevent what I believe is obvious progress. In any case, even if Parliament rules against the report, progress will continue. Clearly, millions and millions of human beings are at risk and threatened with death. There is, however, a strong chance that these new technologies could produce cures or improved treatments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I say yes to the Caudron report, yes to the hope that European research may rise to the challenge presented by the United States and other world economies. With this in mind, we should invest in European research capable of taking our values to even greater heights. Our scientists must be allowed to work in the most promising domain possible, namely embryo stem cell research. Frankly speaking, this is the issue which will very shortly highlight the rift between us. Ladies and gentlemen, the future is at stake here. It cannot be held up because it is already upon us. Sooner or later it will overcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a delight to participate in the work on the framework programme. I also want to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way in which he began the discussion with new ideas about the European Research Area. I have seen how the ideas floated by the Commissioner have taken root in the countries of the EU and created a new dynamic of a kind we had not known before and which I would to a large extent ascribe to the Commissioner’s initiative. I am very pleased about the opportunities under the framework programme also to involve countries which do not directly receive aid from the European Union, for example, even Iran and Taiwan can participate, to cite two extremes, if the countries themselves pay and if we find that they add value to the programmes. That means exchanges involving young people in areas that are important for the future. It provides the opportunity for new creativity and new understanding within research, something that will be very valuable, especially in the world of today.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to nuclear research, I believe that Europe should promote this in areas which can contribute to our actively participating in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, weapons grade plutonium, etc. We have facilities. We have knowledge that can be made use of. The international mood today is such that there is now a possibility of having these things destroyed. Let us make sure that they are destroyed, and allow Europe to take part in their destruction. Finally, I hope that the Commissioner, together with his Director-General, will take the lead when it comes to the simplification that is necessary if small and medium-sized companies, together with university departments, are happily able to participate in the programme without experiencing financial difficulties.</p>

Amendment No 22, providing for Community funds for embryo research, is utterly unacceptable, being a flagrant offence against human dignity. Embryos must not be degraded to the level of being research material. Embryo research is banned in four Member States, including Germany. We must not permit the use of Community funds to finance something that is punishable in these Member States. Even research on embryo stem cells would offer an incentive to create even more surplus embryos, and we decisively reject it for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal even offers support to germline therapy. This would mean the European Parliament distancing itself, politically and scientifically, from the rest of the world, for nobody in the scientific community is demanding or promoting germline therapy, far from it, they are calling for it to be outlawed.</p>
<p class="contents">So I ask you to let us clear these ethical mines from the research framework programme and make the programme we adopt a responsible one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document is, I believe, so excellent and innovative that it is almost a sin that the debate in Parliament should concentrate on ethics and the use of stem cells, important though that issue may be, while losing sight of all the novel, highly significant elements present in this Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that identifying the eight priority thematic areas for research is an innovative, important and positive idea; there is, however, a danger that small and medium-sized European enterprises might be excluded from the identification of areas structurally more suited to large businesses. Mr Caudron’s proposal of the instrument of the stairways of excellence seems to me to be a valid compromise, and I therefore agree with it, although I still ask the Commission and the Commissioner always to pay the greatest attention to the requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger that European research funds might end up being monopolised by large companies, which, by definition, are those that perhaps need them least since they patently already have the capacity to propose and run research programmes, is still very real.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, we wish to build that knowledge-based society that was sketched out in Lisbon, research must permeate our whole society and therefore impinge, first of all, on small and medium-sized European enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to conclude, a remark on the Euratom programme: I agree with the appropriations proposed in the report; we need to give the green light to the ITER project, which must not, however, be confused with the nuclear power schemes we know today. Here we are talking about research and the future of clean energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen and Mrs McNally, for their contributions and the respect they have shown towards those individual Members who have sought to improve this framework programme with their amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The text originally proposed by the Commission has been considerably supplemented and rejigged, now both specifying more clearly the research priorities in Europe in the various sectors and rejigging the initial financial architecture. With regard to the biomedical sector, I must express my satisfaction with the EUR 500 million increase given to biomedicine, not just for genome and post-genome research but for all research aimed at adding to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of diseases as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to affirm a fundamental idea already expressed by Mr Trakatellis, which is that no research in Europe can be more important or deserve greater priority than that which concerns people’s health and their physical and mental suffering. That is why I now ask Commissioner Busquin, on behalf of the whole scientific community and of a number of Nobel prize-winners, such as my friend Renato Dulbecco, Rita Levi Montalcini and John Vane, to maintain this increase in funding for biomedical research for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Through scientific research we can at last, thanks to new technologies, combat terrible, hitherto incurable diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer’s, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, heart disease and so on, not least by using advanced technologies, as specified, for instance, in the Trakatellis, Purvis and Nisticò amendment, which embodies a good balance that should gain the consensus of the whole House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we might say in German, it is easier to guard a sack of fleas than draw together the different interests in this House, and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks for his successful efforts in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">With the research framework programme, we want to make a contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of European industry. We want to underpin and support our European policies through research. However, we also want to bring research closer to citizens. I am pleased, therefore, that in this latter area, we have been able to make some improvement to the Commission's proposal through three important steps.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this process, it is important, in my view, for us to ensure that research complies with the principle of sustainable development as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Gothenburg Council Conclusions. We must bring ecological criteria into line with social and economic criteria, and so it is only right and proper that research should be subject to this principle too. This is reflected in a number of the amendments relating to energy and sustainable transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important, and necessary, to interconnect research and society, firstly by examining every research project to determine the effect of research on society: in other words, by carrying out technology impact assessments, and secondly, by actively including citizens in the research dialogue and strengthening this dialogue between research and society. It is only right and proper, in my view, for us to increase the available resources in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The third building block to bring research closer to citizens is undoubtedly to enhance the opportunities available to SMEs, universities and small research institutions for participation in this process, as they, of course, offer great potential for innovation, and many people, many Europeans, are involved. We must therefore ensure that the processes are simple, transparent and speedy, and above all, that those who are rejected also receive a response which signals that researchers are taken seriously. If we are able to realise these three dimensions: sustainability, dialogue between research and society, and an effective approach to SMEs, then, I am sure, research will find a place not only in the minds of Europeans, but also in their hearts.</p>

Of course, I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for his two excellent reports. I would like to express my appreciation of the positive and constructive cooperation within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as well. I too found this a very enjoyable experience, thanks, not least, to the sterling work carried out by our shadow rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise two issues. Firstly, genetic research: genetic and biotechnology offer great opportunities in medicine and the environment, and it is certainly right to give massive support to these areas at European level. However, as soon as human embryos become the subject of research, I believe that for ethical reasons, clear limits must be set. Some Member States, including Germany, have banned the use of human embryos for research purposes, and this naturally includes associated activities such as the cloning of human life.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that our consideration and respect for other Member States make it incumbent on us to exclude activities which obviously raise serious issues of ethical responsibility from joint European research funding, and I therefore urge this House to vote for Mr Posselt's Amendment No 334 or Mr Liese's Amendment No 332.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which I would like to address briefly is fusion research. I wish to voice my clear support for the funding of fusion research. I believe that nuclear fusion can be developed as a future-proof technology. It produces virtually no carbon dioxide emissions which impact on climate. It also produces very little in the way of radioactive waste, and in particular, in contrast to nuclear fission, has no significant harmful effects over the long term. In this respect, we Europeans should take the opportunity afforded in this area, in which we have a unique status worldwide – to continue appropriate research. We should not cut the budget but leave it, at least, at the level originally proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no dignity in dying of motor neurone disease and there is precious little dignity in suffering from Parkinson's either. So I want to commend to the House the view of the sufferer as well as the view – if there is to be one – of the person who is concerned above all about preserving the embryo.</p>
<p class="contents">If I thought that an embryo had the same human rights as a child or an adult human being, I would not, of course, not be in favour of anything that meant the destruction of human life. But the laws of our Member States by and large accept that there is a difference between an embryo, a fertilised egg and an adult or child who is already a human being. The human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other. That is what the law says in most of our Member States. I do not believe that the founder of the Christian religion, who set great store by healing the sick, would inhibit those who simply want to cure sick people. I cannot believe that this is the intention of the Christian ethic.</p>

I know from experience how much work is involved in bringing a framework programme to a conclusion, at least in draft form. We will now formally adopt this programme today or tomorrow. It is a time for great words, and great words are needed. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Paper does not blush, however. We will have a good programme, but the work is only just beginning. What are we going to do with all these objectives set out on paper? How will we achieve these goals? At the moment, this is written not so much in the stars as in the heads of the civil servants or, indeed, the Commissioner. We therefore urgently need more precise details of this entire project. We urgently need the specific programmes. That is the first point. We also urgently need further cooperation with the Commission if these specific programmes have to be amended by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is this: there is no sense in allocating EUR 17, 18, 16 billion – the figure has not yet been finally decided – if these funds are not used where they are most needed, that is, in the universities, in industry, and in the SMEs. It is therefore vital to ensure that the rules governing participation in this framework programme are practicable, in line with the realities of the research world, and meet the needs of companies seeking to develop their innovations on the basis of this funding. After all, we should not forget that research and innovation are not ends in themselves. The purpose of research and innovation is to bring products to market and improve our competitiveness. This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation, if the allocation instruments are transparent, and if everyone, from Finland to Sicily and Greece, knows what his or her position is.</p>
<p class="contents">The real work therefore starts here, not only for the Commission staff but also for us. After the framework programme means before the next framework programme, but, above all, it means during implementation. This House must therefore look very closely to determine how much continuity exists between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes, how reliable the instruments used by the Commission are, and how this money is spent. We will also carry out an ex post audit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much. I look forward to further years of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems. We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta, umbilical cord and adult stem cells. We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos, any kind of cloning, the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention. The majority, therefore, in the temporary committee, whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union, rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report. EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research, banned in four Member States, my own country included.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements. I urge that we do not desert this principle. Many citizens, myself included, believe that there is a more acceptable, ethical and moral way forward than the one which leads us to destroy one innocent human life in order to cure another. I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Munich is one of the most modern locations for research in the European Union, and Franz Josef Strauss set a course 30 years ago which has ensured that there is still an aerospace industry today.</p>
<p class="contents">As a location for research, Munich has never suffered from the fact that research policy has always set clear ethical limits. On the contrary, these clear ethical limits include banning research on embryo stem cells, the import of embryo stem cells and the creation of embryos for research purposes, for such techniques are nothing but cannibalism. Even if human life is saved through the killing of other human life, I believe this is ethically unacceptable. It is cannibalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that in all its decisions since 1988, since the Ghergo report, the European Parliament has adhered to this position by a clear majority and that the German Bundestag's Study Commission adopted this line, also with a clear majority, on Monday evening, referring in this context to the Fiori report which we adopted last week by a substantial majority in our Committee on Human Genetics. I think it would be most regrettable if this important, high-quality research framework programme were associated with any attempt to undermine the European Parliament's clear ethical line on embryo protection and the protection of human life.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge to you to vote for the Scallon/Posselt amendment, and if this is not adopted, to support the Liese/Fiori compromise amendment and reject all the other amendments on this issue. The European Parliament's reputation is at stake: a reputation associated with its position, for more than 10 years, at the forefront of those who strive to protect human life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will also help it to benefit from progress being made in other corners of the world, while helping it to contribute towards the development of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have to meet this challenge, at both European and national level. This means bold funding for research in all sectors, coordinating research at European level, in contrast to the current fragmentary approach, and disseminating it throughout the economic and social fabric. Our success in achieving our political and development objectives will depend directly on how we use the results of research for the benefit of the health and quality of life of our citizens, full employment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on the need for research in the social sector. Our development depends first and foremost on the viability of our social model. The social agenda which we have adopted and are currently applying is the basis for this policy. Economic and social change has led our economy and society into an impasse. Ageing, widespread poverty and social exclusion, large numbers of accidents at work, the need to successfully integrate large groups of citizens such as the Roma, the need to integrate the disabled into the job market, the constant need to help women enter the job market, new risks to employees' health and our increasingly multicultural society in Europe are such that we need scientific research on which to base our policy over coming years. This will encourage European countries with no tradition of social research, which are the very countries which face the worst development problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress the need for public information and consultation on all our research objectives. Research in all sectors, from biotechnology to social research, is carried out a long way from the ground, in closed laboratories or study firms. Our citizens are unable to read the articles not just in scientific journals, but also in the broadsheets. We need to make an effort to ensure that information is provided on a systematic basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Citizens should be aware of this extensive transformation, so that they can see the good cooperation between the institutions. I think that this is due, to a large extent, to Mr Caudron’s flexibility and capacity to listen, and this is also true of rapporteurs from other political parties, such as Mr Van Velzen, who has been listening throughout and welcoming the amendments and various suggestions from all Members. I have never worked in a committee where all requests have been treated in this way and incorporated. I would like this spirit to be maintained throughout the implementation process, because it is clear that this is a European project that needs to continue growing and expanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that this journey has been carried out on the basis of a policy that aims to reduce work, reduce the work of the committee and to create fewer projects, but larger ones, and Parliament has been able to break down this centrality with regard to large projects, large companies and various research programmes that are essentially covering work that on many occasions is quasi-public with regard to the large research centres or large industries, such as the aeronautical industry. Parliament has been able to open this project up in more directions, extending its range of priorities to territories that, up until now, were not covered or that were not considered important.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various innovations which citizens should be aware of: one of these, the most important one in my opinion, is the introduction of a fourth instrument. Introducing a fourth instrument means opening the door to smaller projects, facilitating the entry of SMEs and making the European Research Area a possibility, for Europe comprises many small States and Research Centres. The average European team has no more than six people, whilst an American team consists of 24 people.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs protection measures and incentives that are suited to its dimensions. Europe is still a collection of individual initiatives. For this very reason, the <span class="italic">escalier d’excellence</span> seems to be very effectively set out in Amendment No 305.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also introduced important aspects of relevance to culture. Cultural heritage belongs to the world of non-renewable resources. When the tomb of a mediaeval King disappears, with its costumes and clothing, or when we lose track of a wrecked ship at the bottom of the sea, new technologies have to be used to recover these relics. Architecture, engineering, the structure of buildings, are all in the realm of science. We have supported the safeguarding of cultural heritage and we think that the European Union should also continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament’s opinion at first reading does indeed constitute a milestone along our way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add my voice to those who have congratulated Mr Caudron, the rapporteur. I should like to say to him in all sincerity that the quality of the report and the spirit with which he has imbued it, the energy and the work he has put in are all exemplary in the context of such a difficult task. As Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl pointed out, it was a complex task but Mr Caudron brought it to a successful conclusion and I would particularly like to thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to emphasise that this work was the product of a joint effort and the shadow rapporteurs from other groups were involved in this. I shall not name individuals but I am sure you are all aware of those who have made a constructive contribution to the task in hand over the last few months, as I mentioned earlier. I have in mind also, of course, the rapporteurs of the various committees and obviously, the ITER Committee as a whole, and its Secretariat. They were also involved in the work.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that what we have before us is a high quality joint endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, you will be aware that a number of amendments have been tabled. I shall not attempt to outline the Commission’s position on each individual one because I would need the floor for two hours. You will find the relevant information in an exhaustive table to be lodged with Parliament’s clerk immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, I should like to emphasise that the Commission has widely supported the opinions of the ITER Committee. It is a statistical operation and could perhaps be queried. In fact, however, out of the 334 amendments the Commission has accepted 248 as they stand, in part or in principle. That equates to three-quarters. You will be able to study the explanations given for each amendment, and the reasons why others cannot be accepted. This can be because they are already there in the proposal. It is important to be aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore simply like to present to you the Commission’s positions on major issues as defined in the context of the amendments adopted by the ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer to the structure of the framework programme, its scientific and technological content, the instruments for its implementation, the overall budget and its distribution, and the ethical issue. In conclusion, I shall say a few words on the management of the programme, because, as we have emphasised, this is clearly the key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the structure of the framework programme as a whole, the Commission shares Parliament’s views as expressed in Amendment No 36 tabled originally by Mr van Velzen. I am delighted that Parliament and the Commission are of a single mind concerning the concept of a single specific programme for all the main thematic areas. This should result in multidisciplinary coherence and a strategic vision of research in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrangement also allows for Parliament to closely monitor the implementation. Each of the eight priorities will in fact have a separate budgetary line on which Parliament will be able to exercise its budgetary control.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the scientific and technological content, most of the amendments, namely Amendment Nos 30 to 294, relate to the scientific content. We wish to signal our agreement with a series of suggestions by Parliament concerning priority numbers 2 ‘Information society technologies’, 3 ‘Nanotechnologies’, 4 ‘Aeronautics’, and 7 ‘Citizens in the European knowledge-based society’. We have in mind for instance Mrs Schroeder’s amendments concerning respect for privacy in the field of information technologies, and also the Committee on Employment’s amendments on research to support the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Most notably, the Commission agrees to reorganise the content of priorities 1 ‘Genomics and health’, 5 ‘Food safety’, and 6 ‘Sustainable development’, along the lines suggested by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards priority 1, namely broadening the scope to include the study of the genomes of all living organisms and strengthening the elements of medical research, particularly regarding cancer, in two separate sections along the lines suggested by Mr van Velzen and particularly in the spirit of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines’ and Mr Caudron’s amendments, we can accept all that is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to respond to Mrs Sandbaek’s comments on poverty-related diseases and immunisation against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Clearly, provision has already been made for this, as Mrs McNally pointed out. Such provision is within the framework of international policy, and the technological platform for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is exactly in line with the spirit of Mrs Sandbaek’s question. That question had indeed already been dealt with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> As regards priority 5, the agricultural research aspects linked to food safety will be strengthened, in keeping with a number of the amendments suggested by the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Fisheries. Mr Pietrasanta’s and Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s amendments will also be taken into account in priority 5: Food safety</p>
<p class="contents">Priority 6 will be restructured as suggested by Mr Caudron, Mr Lange, Mr Hyland and Mr van Velzen. There will be three distinct sections encompassing issues related to the environment, transport and energy. Renewable energy will, of course, be included in the chapter on energy. A number of specific aspects of various forms of renewable energy will be emphasised. The Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Transport also expressed themselves in favour of a change of this nature. The sustainable development priority will therefore be subdivided into three sections dealing with these three aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Before turning to more general points, I should add that the Commission also accepts or takes into consideration a number of amendments concerning both content and general policy. By way of example I could refer to Mr Glante’s amendment on the involvement of the candidate countries, Mrs McNally’s amendment excluding research into weapons and Mr Linkohr’s amendment on research linked to security matters which could be dealt with under the title of research into emerging themes and in the framework of the Joint Research Centre. We also have small and medium sized enterprises very much in mind. Mr Rovsing and Mr Carraro quite rightly reminded us of their role this morning. Clearly, small and medium sized enterprises will have a specific role to play in the next framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the instruments, the Commission broadly endorses the approach enshrined in Parliament’s amendments. The basic thought is indeed to make it possible for the more classical instruments currently in place to be used alongside the new, more integrating instruments for a specific period. That was in fact what Mrs McNally proposed. Hence the Commission’s suggestion in its proposal on the rules of involvement, to resort to specific targeted actions and coordination actions under the heading of the stairway of excellence envisaged by Mr Caudron, the rapporteur. The proposal will be in line with at least the spirit of this idea of a stairway of excellence. Nonetheless, it is essential for the new instruments to remain the main priority tools for implementing this part of the framework programme. Only through their structuring effect will a genuine European Research Area become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Budget, I should like to thank the Parliament for having gritted its teeth and demonstrated budgetary realism by remaining within the limits of the Commission’s proposal. In real terms this represents a 17% increase as against the overall budget for the previous framework programme. I think I already mentioned how significant this is inasmuch as the figures proposed by the Commission were arrived at following a needs assessment and in the light of the financial perspective and the possibilities provided under heading 3 of the internal budget policies. We believe that the Member States will adopt this same approach at Council as it is a logical, coherent and reasonable way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Parliament’s proposal to increase the global envelope by EUR 100 million, that is not a substantial additional amount. Nevertheless, we feel we should retain the decisions already taken, in order to avoid inter-institutional trading. The Commission therefore wishes to retain the initial global position of EUR 17.5 billion in the interests of interinstitutional consistency. We shall then have to consider how to deal with the fusion issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the latter, it would be wise to demonstrate flexibility when interpreting the principle of reserved use of EUR 200 million for ITER. All activities relating to ITER are, in fact, concerned, not simply with the construction of the machine. In this way it will be possible to maintain the potential for present and future research. It would also be wise to interpret fusion in an even more positive manner. I have taken Mr Linkohr’s image on board with pleasure. It is however the case that in the next twenty years very interesting research will be conducted also on materials and on how to effect magnetic confinement. This will be in addition to still more wide-ranging research, going beyond fusion and relevant to the development of new technologies in a whole range of other sectors. This therefore is the type of presentation we are aiming at. Furthermore, it is in line with what was voted for at the ITER Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say in this connection, that jointly with the Member States, the Commission will set up a working group charged with setting targets in the less distant future, taking 2020 as a guide. This is a long way off, but in a sense 2020 is also quite close. Such an initiative would bear considerable fruit too. Indeed, a number of Member States broadly supportive of the 2020 end date for material essential to fusion put just such a proposal to Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As for distribution of the framework programme budget allocation, the Commission will support the general direction of the guidelines proposed by Parliament. This follows almost inevitably from the Commission’s acceptance of the amendments to content. Clearly, if we accept amendments to content in certain areas we must, of course, fund them. When research extends to areas which were not anticipated at the outset, the budget must, of course, keep in step, otherwise it will fall to a critical level. Nonetheless, the scope of the adjustments we envisage is less extensive than what Parliament proposed. This is so as not to go beyond real needs insofar as they can be calculated, but also so as not to completely starve of resources the activities under the so-called eighth priority. Additional information is called for and we shall provide it.</p>
<p class="contents">Why not risk depriving these activities of resources? The reason is that such activities are of considerable significance. In particular, they concern research relevant to the reform of the common agricultural policy. This is one of the major aims of Community policy. It is important in itself and increasingly so in the context of enlargement. Also involved are the implementation of policy on fisheries and the epidemiological aspects of public health, security and justice. These are all issues which cannot be dealt with appropriately under the heading of other priorities. The latter are more specific and come under what could be described as more clearly targeted research programmes. This represents a field of action, an effort to support research and development areas related to community policies. Adequate funding must be made available. I also have in mind Mr Verheugen’s call for support for all policies relating to enlargement, notably in the area of life sciences.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to ethics, we did consider the amendment adopted by the ITER committee in the report drawn up by Mr Caudron. We are quite prepared however, to consider the amendments tabled at plenary. This is indeed a sensitive issue. The text the Commission proposes to insert into the decision specifically excludes from Community funding research aimed at creating human embryos purely for research purposes or in order to create stem cells. This is in addition to excluding research into human reproductive cloning, and research aimed at modifying the human genetic heritage. As I understand them, these amendments are also intended to exclude the transfer of cell nuclei amongst other processes. I refer to the amendments tabled by Mr Nisticò, Mr Trakatellis and Mr Purvis.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust I am not trying your patience. I should like to make two last points. Firstly, coordination has not been given the importance it deserves. Mrs Maes, I do believe that the coordination of national programmes is a key element in the construction of a genuine European Research Area, and I mean national and regional programmes. You will be aware that we issued a communication on ‘regions and research’, and EUR 400 million will be allocated to it. This may be used to support coordination activities, particularly in a number of clearly identified areas to which several of Parliament’s amendments refer. I can tell you for instance that childhood diseases and diabetes are now included under the framework of coordination of national policies. I have in mind the amendment tabled by Mr Nisticò, Mr Fiori and Mr Bowis. The same applies to seismic risk, with Mr Caudron’s and Mr Nisticò’s amendments, to fossil fuels and maybe also to ecosites and Mr Piétrasanta’s amendment. I am not however sure that the latter will be adopted. Clearly, there is action with regard to coordination of national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now refer to management. The management of framework programmes has come in for criticism and rightly so. The Court of Auditors is one of these critics. In particular, it had criticised the complexity of management. We are therefore firmly committed to a single aim in this regard: to simplify management for the scientific community, and for small and medium sized enterprises. Simplifying, however, also means limiting constraints and accepting a degree of flexibility out of regard for public money and the observations made by the Court of Auditors. We shall therefore prepare the proposal. We have taken the initiative with the new instruments. In particular, the issue of rules of participation is very important and you will be called upon to determine them. I should say to Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl that we are currently engaged in a debate on these rules with the players in the scientific community, enterprises and Parliament. That is our next task.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament. I believe an important task has been concluded. As a result, it will now be possible for us to move towards the European Research Area that I am sure we are all aiming to create. Thank you for your work and for your contribution.</p>
