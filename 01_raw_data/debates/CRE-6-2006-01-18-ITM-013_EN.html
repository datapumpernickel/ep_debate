<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dominique Vlasto (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, if I could only put forward one argument in defence of this report, it would be that there are around 25 million small enterprises in Europe, employing nearly 95 million people. They are the backbone of the European economy, a major breeding ground for jobs and growth, and we need to make the most of their potential.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Charter for Small Enterprises is a symbol of their importance, and it is the only official document devoted entirely to them. This Charter has provoked many attacks from businessmen. Unfortunately, five years after it came into being, the results achieved are still very uneven and its implementation remains inadequate even though it has had some success among the professional organisations and 35 countries have signed it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, these small businesses consider themselves to be the orphans of a Europe that cannot manage to provide them with a system of consultation, dialogue and work. Whether in my home town of Marseilles or elsewhere, the heads of small and craft enterprises see Europe as a machine producing costs and restrictions. For these executives, the internal market – which is, in fact, undoubtedly a success – is not an opportunity, it is an illusion. And if these business leaders do not have confidence in European policies, that is a real problem. It is quite clear that the regulatory framework we are creating is not a success if 98 % of businesses in the European Union feel that it does not work for their line of business.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Charter needs to be an instrument that will enable us to regain the trust of small enterprises in Europe. Its implementation must enable us to assess the progress made by all the European states and institutions in improving the regulatory, financial and political environment in which small businesses operate. That is why we are calling for a more critical annual report. It is, however, regrettable that this year's annual monitoring report does not really make it possible to assess the progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for better implementation of the Charter, so as to make a significant contribution to the European Commission's essential commitment to better regulation. That is why we suggest, firstly, strengthening the implementation of the Charter by ensuring that its small and micro-businesses dimension is retained with actions specifically intended for them; greater involvement from the professional organisations; maintaining the dissemination of best practices and exchanges of good practice; and retaining a specific annual report on the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no objection to a reflection on the implementation of the Charter, but we would ask you not to sacrifice the Charter for Small Enterprises by tying it into the Lisbon Strategy. This approach must remain complementary to and distinct from the other policies targeting SMEs and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This also recognises a reality that we need to take into account: small enterprises have specific needs and abilities that are different from those of businesses with 250 to 10 000 employees. This principle, as set out by the Commission, is that we must think about small enterprises. This commitment now needs to be translated into reality, because that is not always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look, for example, at the REACH proposal, we do not get the impression that this principle was applied. It was the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that introduced the adjustments and measures intended to make REACH applicable to and bearable for small enterprises. It is for the benefit of these small enterprises that I have once again stressed in my report the importance of simplifying legislation. We would ask you once again to institute a clear and precise method for performing impact assessments, particularly for the smaller SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">This defence of the Charter and of better regulation is at the heart of this report. It includes a number of other proposals from my fellow Members, and I would like to thank them for their positive contribution. What we propose is a complete work programme, first of all to get to know small businesses better, but above all to make progress in a number of fields, including taxation, aid for investment, innovation and research and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am not going to go into the details of the proposals made, but the Commission and the Member States will find in my report a source of inspiration for action.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to say a few quite fundamental words about the Commission’s policy for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The rapporteur has just spoken of the ‘orphanage’ of SMEs in Europe. I myself use the expression ‘shadow existence’, and of course both expressions imply massive criticism: criticism of the fact that, even though there has been constant discussion of SMEs in the past, none of the European institutions has really done any serious work on improving their situation. I resolved to change that, and I am pleased to be able to tell you that last year saw a political breakthrough for European SME policy. Not only has there been recognition at all levels of the priority given by SMEs to growth and jobs but, at long last, serious work is now being done across the board on taking the necessary steps to enable SMEs to really fulfil their tremendous potential for growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievement of Europe’s objectives – stable, sustainable growth and full employment – will only be possible with the help of SMEs. Large enterprises will not help us to achieve these objectives, as their tendency to cut jobs is also set to continue in future. For this reason, I do not quite agree with the rapporteur on one point. I differ fundamentally from her in that I am firmly convinced that it was not until the Charter policy was integrated into the new growth and jobs strategy that the policy for SMEs became top priority in Europe. I simply cannot understand how it is possible to say that large enterprises should have their place in this growth and jobs strategy but the smaller ones should not. In Europe, two-thirds of the workforce are employed by SMEs. It is not the large enterprises but the smaller ones that are the employers. Small and medium-sized enterprises are at the heart of this strategy, which can only succeed if SMEs actually continue to be central.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I really am firmly convinced that the clear improvement in the political environment for SMEs that has been achieved over the past year can be traced back directly to our having accorded this policy its rightful place in the European Union’s growth and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interim, the Member States have also reported on their national reform programmes in implementation of the new growth and employment policy. I am pleased to be able to tell you that more than half of the Member States have designated the policy for SMEs a priority in these national reform programmes. I do think that there is still room for improvement; we shall be reporting to Parliament on this in a few weeks’ time. For example, at least on occasion, a lack of detail on the measures taken is still evident, which could lead to an overly optimistic assessment, but this is just the start of the process, of course, and this process will become even more effective, and is, I believe, capable of succeeding. At any event, the Charter itself will be retained. Furthermore, it serves as a point of reference for the exchange of best practice and mutual learning. The main instrument, the annual Charter conferences, will be continued. Best practice in a selected number of SME policy areas will be presented at the annual Charter conference in Vienna on 13 and 14 June 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Parliament started work on its report, a few things have changed. On 10 November of last year, the Commission adopted its Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment; which would not have been necessary, of course, had I been convinced that the current policy is sufficient. The Commission Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment now constitutes the coherent framework for the various instruments of enterprise policy, and goes much further than the 10 lines for action in the Charter. The Communication emphasises the importance of SMEs in the context of Lisbon and establishes the ‘<span class="italic">think small first’</span> principle for all EU policy fields. It also specifies the daily challenges faced by SMEs and proposes measures for enhancing their ability to grow and create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication supports the European partnership for growth and jobs, which recognises the importance of promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Europe and creating a favourable political environment for SMEs. There are some special policy fields on which I should like to say just a few brief words. The Commission has adopted a communication on home state taxation, which it hopes will be carried through. That would help SMEs involved in international business. The Commission attaches the utmost importance to improving access to SME financing instruments, which is a fundamental problem. I shall do everything I can to ensure that, in the next financing period, too, the available resources are sufficient to enable the continuation of this successful project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is preparing an initiative to further entrepreneurship education in Europe. There is simply not enough entrepreneurial spirit in Europe; there are not enough people prepared to become entrepreneurs. This is not only a matter of economic conditions, but also of the cultural, social and political environment. Endeavours to arouse entrepreneurial spirit and impart the relevant knowledge must start in schools and universities. Finally, I should like to point out that we are also currently in the process of drawing up proposals to make it easier for SMEs to pass from one owner to another. In the years ahead, we shall see millions of cases where enterprises pass into new ownership, and failure to manage these correctly could put millions of jobs at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, we have reached a point at which the right ideas, plans and strategies need to be put into practice across the board. This is not primarily the responsibility of the European institutions: our options and means are limited. In essence, it is up to the Member States. For this reason, I would appeal to the Member States to increase still more their recognition of the opportunities and potential lying precisely in the promotion of SMEs.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I should also like to welcome the initiative by the Austrian Presidency in immediately defining the European Charter for Small Enterprises, so that specialised initiatives and measures can be promoted to strengthen the competitiveness and employment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Economic and Social Committee highlights certain financial and tax incentives in its opinion which could help small- and medium-sized enterprises to break into the economic area of competitiveness, research and technology and the mobility of workers: not fragmentary and dispersed mobility, mobility within the framework of a clear European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to refer to the question of relocations of large enterprises, which have a significant impact on turnover and employment in small- and medium-sized enterprises, given that many of them act as sub-contractors. I agree with the Austrian Presidency that, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, subsidised investments need to be promoted at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, small- and medium-sized enterprises live and work in the shadow of multinationals, of large chains, and in the shadow of bureaucracy. In order to address this state of affairs, I would point out that important horizontal, national and Community measures need to be taken, which will include:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, simplifying bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, promoting a simplified general system of financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises which will include new banking products.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, simplifying the tax liabilities of small- and medium-sized enterprises, taking account of the fact that the pilot plan for the taxation of small- and medium-sized enterprises in their country of establishment could help in this direction, with the ultimate objective of adopting a common, unified basis for taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, strengthening incentives for the integration of innovation and research, on the basis of the proposals of the Commission itself on competitiveness and national aid and within the framework of the 7th research programme.</p>

I speak today as a Vice-President of the SME circle here in Parliament, as well as the draftsman of the opinion on the Commission report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I am delighted to record that this opinion was not only passed unanimously in that committee, but that all its suggestions were incorporated into the final report by Mrs Vlasto which was also passed unanimously in the Committee on Industry. So I thank Mrs Vlasto for her cooperation and congratulate her on an excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">One might ask, then, why we are bothering to have a debate, especially at this very late hour, given this complete agreement on all sides of the House. I suggest that the answer is very simple: we do not want just a debate about SMEs, we want a debate that will lead to concrete action, and we want concrete action not just by Member States but also by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I welcome the comments you made elsewhere today that 2006 will be a year of delivery for SMEs. All of us want to help you deliver. We see ourselves as on the same side as you. I would just like to mention quickly three specific ideas. We want the voice of small businesses to be heard loudly, clearly and officially within the social dialogue, not to be drowned out by the larger social partners, as happens now. A concrete proposal has been promised. Can you please confirm when it will arrive, in what form it will arrive, and how we can help you to turn it into a reality when it does arrive?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Charter has proposed that SMEs should be exempted from certain regulatory obligations. Can you please confirm whether the Commission will lead by example in this respect and, if so, when we can expect some concrete proposals from the Commission on this issue too?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given that apparently there will be no more annual Charter reports from the Commission in future, how will the Commission ensure that issues facing SMEs remain increasingly front-of-mind within Member States, given the temptation for it to be weaker, rather than stronger? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chancellor Schüssel of the Austrian Presidency, who was here this morning, was himself once the secretary-general of an organisation for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which is why he is so familiar with the problems and knows the importance of doing more in this field. I am also very much obliged to Commissioner Verheugen, because the Charter report has, of course, considerably increased the focus on SMEs, and thus further increased the focus on efforts to promote this kind of enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is also good to regard this preliminary study – that is, the detailed, in-depth study that is being carried out in all the Member States – as a preliminary study on the Lisbon process, so as to give the Lisbon process, too, corresponding relevance. In this way, we know what needs to be done in the field of SMEs to show the non-governmental organisations, and ultimately also the Council and the Commission, where the strong and weak points lie. I consider it extremely important that the three pillars we have created here – ‘macro-economic’, ‘micro-economic’ and ‘employment’ – show clearly that, in the final analysis, SMEs account for 80% of taxes. A social Europe must keep the spotlight on this. We must look at where taxes are ultimately coming from and then, in future, reduce this burden on the enterprises and particularly the workers concerned, so that they can earn larger profits and higher salaries. At the same time, excise tax should make a corresponding contribution to tax revenue, because imports from low-wage countries represent a particularly great opportunity for us in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I should like to make is that I do not understand the reasons for the cuts in the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP), which puts the spotlight on entrepreneurship. In this connection, we should work with the Commission in the context of this proposal to restore the full amount that was given to the CIP programme under the original proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also calls on the Commission to intervene with targeted Community measures because, as Mrs Vlasto has said, small enterprises still feel abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">The report recommends simplifying taxation systems; providing incentives for innovative enterprises; reducing the bureaucratic burden, especially during the start-up phase of small businesses, but not only then; providing easier access to credit; and exempting them from paying corporation tax on the European subsidies that they are granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission report on the implementation of the Charter, which is the basis for this parliamentary report, contains a number of gaps: for instance, the data presented are not homogeneous and it is therefore difficult to compare situations referring to different countries. We should have preferred the Commission report to be more structured, more systematic and also more critical, with reference to progress on matters of entrepreneurial spirit and culture, for instance. In any case, we call on the Commission to act in concert with the Member States and above all with organisations representing small businesses. To that end, I stress the importance of involving such organisations to a greater extent, including through the establishment of standing working parties.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time to underline how useful the Charter is but, instead, I feel I must strongly emphasise something that Parliament has called for more than once, which is that the Charter needs to be made legally binding. That is the only way we can be sure that the Member States will take it into account when drawing up national policies; otherwise, we run the risk of the Charter becoming a mere list of good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that this will be the last annual report on implementation of the Charter, because in future it will be incorporated within the overall report on the Lisbon Strategy. I can understand the reason for that – according to Commissioner Verheugen, it is to place SMEs at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy – but I can also see the danger of underrating the contribution made by the Charter, particularly in relation to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to add that I find it difficult to comprehend why the Commission says that it considers small enterprises to be the driving force behind the revitalisation of Europe’s economy, when the initiatives aimed at them – as put forward in the Commission document on relaunching the Lisbon process – are pretty limited. How can they be key players in this strategy? That is not to mention the significant cuts in funding that the Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme is almost certain to suffer because of what I regard as the Member States’ miserliness over the Union’s budget. It is unthinkable to promote the future of small businesses in that way, let alone the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a good thing, and I should also like to state quite clearly here that this is also thanks to Commissioner Verheugen, who has given this subject long-overdue momentum. We are obliged to him for this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, except in many speeches, this subject is not always dealt with appropriately. We can see this in our own institution, as Parliament is starting its discussion at an hour not befitting the issue. We should pull our own socks up too, therefore, and improve the way we deal with this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the figures – which have been cited here – we can see that SMEs are our main point of contact for the Lisbon agenda. Employing two-thirds of the workforce, they are the most important employers, but they are also innovators in many fields, being global leaders in niche and part-markets and also accounting for more than 50% of patents. That means that, in these fields, Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition. The financial resources that we allocate to SMEs contrast sharply with this. In this regard it is plain to see that, in the Commission’s original budget allocation, which was a generous estimate, only 0.3% of all resources had fallen to SMEs. Some of my fellow Members have raised the subject of the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP). As the rapporteur, I wish to raise an objection, as there have been cuts in this field. We all agree that we need to increase these resources to the maximum.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, on the positive side, I should like to say that the Commissioner has appointed a representative for SMEs and, in Françoise Le Bail, has made a very good choice. I should like to congratulate him on this and offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur on her sound report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More important still is to put into practice measures to provide effective support for micro-, small- and medium-sized businessmen, which is something that has not happened; far from it. Neoliberal policies have created enormous difficulties for micro and small enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report says, it is not enough simply to have a European Charter for Small Enterprises. The Charter’s actions for small businesses should be incorporated in, and supplemented by, the general policy for SMEs on the basis of binding measures, not only at Community level but also within Member States. It is especially important that small and micro enterprises have recourse to European programmes. Accordingly, conditions must be in place to facilitate the access of such businesses to Community funds, either by amendments to be introduced to the regulations, or by setting up mechanisms of direct, unequivocal support for their associations, in order to help them overcome continuing financial, bureaucratic, tax and other obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to strengthen financial instruments for small and craft enterprises, particularly mutual guarantee systems, and to set up flexible microfinancing systems, aimed at family businesses, those set up by women and young people, helping to cofinance projects and making relevant information available. It should not be forgotten that if the EU does not take measures now, it will be confronted in ten years’ time with millions of small and craft enterprises going out of business, with the attendant risk of millions of job losses, which will exacerbate poverty, the desertification of rural areas and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, as the report says – and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on her work – it is crucial that the European institutions and the Member States implement and develop the actions laid down in the European Charter in full. This must be binding, and not just a matter of paying lip service to the Charter. Furthermore, it must not lose its content on account of its inclusion in the Lisbon Strategy, as Mr Verheugen suggested just now, a prospect that I find worrying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, I would like to agree with those who have expressed hopes that this will not decrease the significance of the policy of support for small enterprises in the future, when the report is included in the joint report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is essential for the European Union not only to maintain but also to extend its role in this policy sphere. Small enterprises very often lack a political lobby and institutional support at Member State level. The burden of tax and bureaucratic procedures places many small enterprises in a discriminatory situation when compared with other market players. Small enterprises, therefore, frequently have to struggle not for special dispensations and the simplification of tax or bureaucratic procedures, but first of all they have to achieve a non-discriminatory environment for their own business activities.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union policy in the sphere of small business support must develop a more effective and aggressive approach, motivating the Member States to take account of the interests of this business group. For this reason I believe that we should back the proposal to give the European Charter for Small Enterprises the force of law. This, however, is not enough to significantly improve the situation in this sphere. The charter must not remain just an instrument for transferring the experience of one country over the border into another, while enterprises remain fenced in inside their own national economies. The charter’s impact would significantly increase the European Union’s political will and foster action for further economic integration, with adoption of the Services Directive as the first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the services sector of the internal market would give this group of businesses unprecedented opportunities and incentives for development, would remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent small- and medium-sized enterprises from crossing national borders. We ought not to forget that it is actually small business activity from which springs the spirit of enterprise, which ensures economic vitality, development and stability in a period of change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for being here today and for the explanations he has given us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is a cliché to say that small- and medium-size enterprises are the backbone of the European economy. However, the fact that it is a cliché does not make it any less important. Two-thirds of companies in Europe are classified as SMEs. Europe has 25 million small- and medium-sized enterprises which, in employment terms, provide no fewer than 95 million jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective, however, is not just for SMEs to struggle on, but rather for them to be able to prosper and grow strong. To this end, we need a model in which SMEs do not just develop by means of merger or acquisition, which is the traditional model, but rather through the growth of the small- and medium-sized enterprises themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress some of the aspects taken up in the report presented by Mrs Vlasto. I agree with her that incorporating the report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises into the report on implementing the Lisbon process could lead to a certain marginalisation of the SME concept.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that we must enhance the annual bilateral dialogue with representatives of SMEs and promote the participation of SMEs through the use of instruments suited to their needs, such as incentives to encourage SMEs to enter the world of research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like finally to refer to something that the Commissioner raised in his speech: it is not possible to have strong small- and medium-sized enterprises if entrepreneurial activity is constantly being undermined. I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we, once and for all, opt decisively to emphasise the social value of entrepreneurial action. I believe that this is fundamental to the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, the Commission promptly needs to mention which Member States have not yet improved the way they do things or implemented the Charter’s lines for action.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs for us are an immense resource and opportunity. We must streamline and simplify legislation the whole time and make it easier to found new companies. Any action that promotes a climate of entrepreneurship has the support of our group. An important goal must be to harmonise company taxation. The problem with the Charter is that it does not contain enough concrete measures which would provide support for innovative companies and their potential for networking. More effective use of the internet and <span class="italic">e</span>business are areas which offer enormous opportunities. The development of electronic public services in Member States as support tools for SMEs is also important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union needs to start implementing the Basel II provisions promptly. That too would facilitate matters. The Commission and the Council should also re-embark on action with regard to a Community patent, which is problematic but essential. The legislation on state aid could be examined, so that companies might receive support in the event that private risk financing shies away.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we should support the establishment of small companies based merely on self-employment, but ambitious and inventive companies are the vital boost which we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, for my part, to draw your attention to two points.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just been talking about SMEs in abstract terms, as an administrative body, needing simplification, more money, a better environmental context, and so on. A small business is, in essence, its leader – I know there are some in this Chamber who have just spoken – and it is now nearly 31 years since I myself set up my first business. We therefore need to take these leaders into account if we are going to give them real answers, so that their small businesses can run properly.</p>
<p class="contents">If you talked to all the heads of SMEs in Europe, they would tell you one thing – that there are not enough hours in the day – and, at this time of night, many of them are still hard at work. We must provide real answers, Commissioner. We must simplify, but in particular we must apply the principle of subsidiarity so that authorities, states and professional organisations can provide real support at local level. It is not up to the European Union to do all of that itself, but it must do it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to our fellow citizens. As has already been said, we must increase awareness right from school age. I would therefore like to make a proposal. Just as there are music and football competitions at European level, why not institute a European 'open day' for small enterprises? Why not organise a European Good Practice Day? Those are just a few ideas on how we can communicate and show our fellow citizens how important our SMEs are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thomas Mann (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, there are 25 million small enterprises employing almost 100 million people. These small enterprises provide well over half of private jobs in the EU and are of great importance to regional, cultural and social development, including in rural areas. They deserve to see their opportunities for innovation and competitive prospects discussed every year. As my fellow Members have already pointed out, the importance of these enterprises was underlined today by Wolfgang Schüssel during his presentation of the programme of the Austrian Council Presidency, when he called for us to ‘wake the sleeping giant’. I fully agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been criticism of the Charter from many quarters, however, on the grounds that it contains too many non-binding appeals. I, too, should like to see substantial measures at Community and, as Commissioner Verheugen said, Member State level. At any event, the 10 lines for action in the Charter are important orientations for enhancing the exchange of best practice, promoting the setting-up of new enterprises and generally creating a positive environment. This starts in school lessons, and we have to set the tone for it from primary level onwards. Once again, Finland is a good example of this. The Netherlands is exemplary with regard to the simplification of regulations, particularly on account of its standardised impact assessments. We agree that work on dismantling the considerable bureaucratic and tax obstacles in the Member States must continue. It is important that subsidies be fully exempt from corporation tax.</p>
<p class="contents">A very good report has been drawn up by Mr Bushill-Matthews in our advisory committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I am thinking in particular of the suggestion to draw up a Green Paper on the reduction of these barriers, and of the call for better access to the Structural Funds and to risk capital funds. Personally, I consider it important that small enterprises promote their apprentices and other staff more through transnational exchanges within the framework of programmes such as the Leonardo da Vinci apprentice exchange programme. This will increase mobility and at the same time create one of the preconditions for small- and micro-enterprises to work together very much better in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also at the heart of the debate in your comments, Commissioner, before the SME intergroup this afternoon and here this evening, affirming that the situation for SMEs is of great concern to the Commission and that we need to create better political conditions for SMEs in Europe. Finally, they are at the heart of the debate in this evening's discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current difficult economic climate, it is often small and craft enterprises that continue to create wealth and form the main source of employment, with local jobs that maintain social cohesion by nourishing the whole territory of the EU. The European Union must be a staunch supporter of these small businesses, by increasing the power of the Charter as a specific assistance instrument and by going beyond good intentions, as called for in Mrs Vlasto's excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that these small businesses continue to be created and passed on, we need to reduce the administrative formalities in Europe and in the Member States; make it easier for them to access capital and European programmes, particularly on research; improve the dissemination of information on measures that help them; and encourage innovation and the fight against counterfeit goods. To do all of that, however, we need ambitious funding, so let us hope that the good fairies who have been looking into the future of these small enterprises today – this sleeping giant, as Chancellor Schüssel put it – turn their wishes into reality by allocating the necessary funds to the various actions and that their good intentions are backed up by specific financial commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to note that the report is rather formal and does not exactly reflect the actual situation. I would like to draw your attention to the problems of small enterprises and business development in the new Member States of the European Union. The level of entrepreneurship in many of these countries – like in my home country, Lithuania – is unfortunately four times lower than in the old Member States, and the prospects for the growth of small businesses are not sufficiently favourable. This will decrease the overall competitiveness of the European Union. The establishment of companies and creation of jobs require conditions attractive for business start-ups as well as favourable funding opportunities. Entrepreneurship and initiative of the citizens are important preconditions for harmonious social development. This is a problem in the new Member States so far. Therefore, these states need an impetus on the part of the European Commission and additional exceptional measures and conditions facilitating the development of small businesses. How? First, it is essential to eliminate the taxation of small business investments, thus opening better possibilities for small companies to use capital resources. Second, small businesses should be ensured access to the Structural Funds on a national level. In my opinion, a certain percentage of the funds should be earmarked for small business. Furthermore, it is vital to simplify the bureaucratic procedures and to reduce the tax burden upon innovative companies to the maximum extent, by exempting them from profit tax, especially at the business start-up stage. </p>

The open coordination method proposed to implement the objectives of the Charter is flexible, which may not only be an advantage, but also a disadvantage. Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur and the Commissioner. We must support SMEs not only with our intentions, but also with our mandatory regulations both at European and Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the Charter, as well as other, sometimes too distant programmes running in parallel with it, should not only be about SMEs, but also be addressed to SMEs. Besides principles, we need pragmatic, easily understandable and actually deliverable information and assistance solutions. Otherwise we will never reach the tens of thousands of forced entrepreneurs who cannot afford the time or resources to enquire about them.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should not forget that SME policy is not a special, separate subject, but one of the horizontal pillars. When we know that the vast majority of our businesses are SMEs, we must also realize that our only lasting, structural solution for the implementation of the cohesion policy, the reduction of unemployment, the enhancement of competitiveness and economic growth, or the facilitation of rural development, research development or even innovation is to build on our own SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not neglect this foundation. This is why I am asking that we do not shut the Charter away in a drawer at the end of the debate, but leave it on our desks as a reminder of the long journey we still have ahead of us until we can say that small enterprises are a success in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improved access to European funding, more streamlined administration, training and tax relief are all essential measures to enable SMEs to exist, to produce, to invest and to employ. Now that the European Union has recognised the importance of the sector, it needs to pay careful attention to the consistency of its policies: the recent debates on chemical substance registration or software patenting, to mention just a couple, have perhaps led people to doubt whether the EU is actually willing to commit itself totally to protecting SMEs. The latest dreadful example comes from the now notorious debate on the textile industry and trade relations with China. Promoting and implementing a charter for SMEs will be a wasted effort until the EU, and the Commission in particular, raises its voice at last to firmly demand that the rules of trade – which are already in themselves extremely unfavourable to small businesses – be obeyed, and to demand the best possible conditions from our international partners to enable this industry to continue to flourish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
